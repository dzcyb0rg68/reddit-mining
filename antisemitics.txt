16	 TheWalkingDeadGame	 Hooded_Rat	 2018-01	 ['cowardice', 'cowardice']	 1514764813	 That wasn't an act of cowardice.  Lee could have taken the shot and put her out of her misery.  Kenny *told* Lee not to, knowing full well he could take that shot.  The Walkers weren't the issue in that scenario.  It's the fact that killing the woman cuts into the time Lee and Kenny have to scavenge for supplies.I agree with you that it's easy to say you would do the right thing in a similar scenario.  That being said, I just want to make it clear that the scene wasn't about cowardice so much as it was about buying time to get supplies.  Kenny even says as much later on in the Season to his wife, which is what I perceived to be one of the main issues that tipped her over into suicide.	
17	 Bitcoincash	 zprtlv	 2018-01	 ['greed']	 1514764816	 I have not forgot my promise it was just a lot harder than I thought, my trading is so philosophical but I don't want to start posting things that go to deep, trying to find a good middle ground. And a bit busy right now with this thread https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7n5x2k/real_local_bitcoin_cash/. But list is coming soon (maybe in parts).I will leave that with one of my most important quotes trading "The market will find your personal weak spot, be it greed or fear, and it will exploit it". Then pair that with a James Dines quote "As a securities analyst I have to be in a state of position-less thinking". Those two might be the most important quotes to most new traders!And another James Dines theory, the wolfpack theory, which roughly states that things move in tandem that has a link. Cryptos is a big wolfpack, but also the top 10 cryptos is another wolfpack, and you can find hundreds of packs inside the cryptos, if you can identify the groups that move together, you can often find that once one start moving some will lag and then you can invest in them. It can be as simple as "Oh the pattern is that all the ASIC related currencies move in a wolfpack" or vice versa.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PnwQLFY60M This is outdated now in information but a lot of the details in his views of trading in his words are extraordinary. I must have listened to this interview several hundred times when it came out. Listening to it now would be to think about how James Dines thinks. If you can get a smell of that then that's huge.

22	 DebateAChristian	 songbolt	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514764976	 "How do you distinguish between deism and atheism?"I see two answers.1. God is the basis for all that exists, and so the question is asking the difference between our current reality and sheer nothing (absence of any thing). In other words reality under the premise 'atheism is true' is impossible to conceive, once you have a proper definition of God (the self-sufficient act of being, existence itself, the source of all being).2. If we ignore all philosophy for the past 3,000 years, *then* the answer becomes "I don't know." However, you presumably meant to ask about theism, not deism, since this forum is to debate *Christians*, in which case I would say there would not be Christianity today; the Church would have failed nearly 2,000 years ago along with the movements of other failed Jewish messiahs or other cult followings today that don't last. We would not hear claims of miracles on the news,* because of course they don't report about things that have absolutely no basis in reality (please read that literally: "fake news" is a different category, namely, lying about reality). I mean to say, for example, no one is publishing stories about Russell's teapot orbiting the sun, because of course there is no good reason to think it exists.*see for examples http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9709/10/teresa.first.slum/index.html?eref=sitesearch http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2299217.stm http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/europe/10/17/vatican.teresa/index.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1562284/Mother-Teresa-miracle-patient-accuses-nuns.html http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35129463 http://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/18/europe/pope-francis-mother-teresa-second-miracle/index.html

28	 conspiracy	 ixexexekal	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514765121	 Take a gander at some of the stuff that floats around these parts and apply that on a true social scale. As things flow here - on the internet - it's effectively a safe space where debunking is only grudgingly tolerated. Crazy stuff is OK. It gets downvoted or ignored and we move one.  In a culture where conspiracy theories dominate, the admission of a problem can never occur because the discussion of what that problem is will be so split between individuals/factions or so thoroughly off-base on a society wide scale ("Dumping trash in the lake isn't what has taken our drinking water from us, it's the &lt;insert minority&gt; who are poisoning it!") that when you're in the mindset you can barely grasp the concepts behind the true cause and outer intervention to clarify are seen only as insulting/malevolent.	
29	 conspiracy	 RedPillFiend	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy', 'conspiracy']	 1514765131	 In regards to Charlemagne, have you heard of this hypothesis? Interesting stuff."The phantom time hypothesis is a historical conspiracy theory asserted by Heribert Illig. First published in 1991, the hypothesis proposes a conspiracy by the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, Pope Sylvester II, and possibly the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, to fabricate the Anno Domini dating system retrospectively, so that it placed them at the special year of AD 1000, and to rewrite history[1] to legitimize Otto's claim to the Holy Roman Empire. Illig believed that this was achieved through the alteration, misrepresentation and forgery of documentary and physical evidence.[2] According to this scenario, the entire Carolingian period, including the figure of Charlemagne, is a fabrication, with a "phantom time" of 297 years (AD 614–911) added to the Early Middle Ages."https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_time_hypothesis

During Passover it is eaten as a flat, cracker-like bread or used in dishes as breadcrumbs and in the traditional matzo ball soup.Matzo that is kosher for Passover is limited in Ashkenazi tradition to plain matzo made from flour and water.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/BreadStapledToTrees/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28	
31	 movies	 PancakeMash	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514765151	 I never said they were all good. And I don't care about a movie's popularity, I care about quality. Most fans of the MCU would agree Winter Soldier is the best in the series, but it's not one of the best selling entries. And you should remember, they're *comic book adaptations.* And comics aren't all homogenous, either. Just look at Watchmen, the revival of the X-men, the Dark Night era of Batman, etc., and Winter Soldier broke a ton of comic book movie tropes. It's a government conspiracy thriller, I shit you not, how could any casual movie fan expect that out of a comic book movie?	
32	 CompetitiveForHonor	 KatsuroAmagi	 2018-01	 ['silencing']	 1514765175	 https://youtu.be/1ZVuVpfFhdQHe calls a Highlander player "Best Highlander in EU" (no discredit to the player) for starting with backstepping light into heavy a majority of the time, not even trying to parry anything. Moreover, he switches to Shaman to beat Highlander, one of the best characters in the game versus arguably THE worst character in the game because he's having too much trouble beating HL with Aramusha. And he's proud of himself for beating Highlander with Shaman and speaks about them as if they're on equal terms, and attributes his win on Shaman to his "skill with Shaman" as opposed to the fact that they're literally on opposite ends of the tier list.---If you can stomach more than a few minutes of that, you can tell why I've always had a problem with True. He isn't a bad player but neither is he particularly great mostly because he has an extremely narrow point of view and absolutely doesn't understand weaknesses of a character. While I wouldn't call for any silencing of someone's opinions, I do think his opinions are unhealthy for anyone listening to them.He can go on and on about a character's strengths and talk about them as if there are no ways to deal with them regardless of which one it is so long as he's losing, and I'm pretty sure he thinks the whole cast is close in balance somehow. His only fallback is that he says he "might be wrong" before any assumptions he ever makes so that he can take it back whenever necessary.---Great little guide. In my own experience- other than with perfect parry kings with crazy punish on characters like Shaman or Cent, I've had continued success as Warden utilizing my side lights just letting them go, while also pretending to miss attacks with a delayed shoulder bash so that they go for either a GB or some kind of approach only to be caught by SB. This is almost definitely because everyone who fights Warden is pretty much conditioned never to expect anything other than top light from a Warden.Doesn't work forever though, of course.

If Israel was a Muslim nation rather than a Jewish nation, it would have been bombed off the face of the planet decades ago for acting so consistently and deliberately in bad faith (not just militarily; the French government has just set up a special tax task force to deal with the huge problem of Israel offering financial channels to Jews in France who want to dodge taxes).

No, she wouldn't necessarily scream or cry to make abuse stop. She's a child and he's an adult, that can be very silencing in an abusive situation. Just because you don't remember a time that matches the description doesn't mean it didn't exist. If this were an abusive situation, these would be bad reasons to doubt your daughter and pretty hurtful. That said, it's understandable to be skeptical in your situation. Just try to tread carefully in case it is true. Absolutely do not discount the possibility that it's true. Pedophiles are often people we know, like or love. 	
37	 MandelaEffect	 Ussurin	 2018-01	 ['jew', 'jewish']	 1514765212	 Simply put words of God are truth, but humans are just humans. Not every idea is easily understandable and even harder to write down on paper. Not to mention humans in the past where less developed in all aspects.Even if God would for example make someone aware of evolution, then that person would get a hard time explaining and getting people to believe in ancient times. And the knowledge of evolution isn't the lesson that was needed in any way to be learnt. It's nice to know it, but it's not neccesary for anything in spiritual sense. But the lesson that we are able to good and bas and animals don't is far more important in spiritual sense. To know that the gift of knowledge means you cannot be arogant any longer. We are the ones that think, so we cannot no longer be arogant to world and it's hardships, therefore we no longer can be in the Garden. Just because word of God is true doesn't mean He haven't used alegories to present concepts to use.Onto that we need to add humans being faulty and changing stuff throughout ages both by mistakes and for personal gains. Judaism was practically controlled by ancient Jew kingdom and who knows what parts of Old Testament are really word of God and what's just old propaganda and non-religious law. That's why Christians kinda take Old Testament lightly. New Testament is way newer and if something doesn't add up one may believe that Son of God knows better than mere humans before. But even New Testament should be looked upon with scrutiny as Popes and friends weren't really the best at being apolitical.Good rule of thumb is that both Jesus and parts of Old Testament that serve no use for personal gain were very rarely said/written in up-front way. Nearly always in some alegory or anegdote. We can assume that is the way God said something. Rest is mostly assumed true, but more in a way "we cannot prove this ain't the word of God, so we better stay true to it, but we won't throw you out of church for not throwing stones at your wife if she cheats at you as that's highly unlikely to be word of God considering New Testament, etc. and is probably just some shit thrown into scripture by ancient jewish society."That's at least how Catholic Church interprets Bible in my region of the world.

39	 DaystromInstitute	 khaosworks	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy', 'conspiracy']	 1514765254	 On a sarcastic note, one might ask what impact UFO conspiracy theorists have had on Earth society. Aside from the Heaven's Gate tragedy, very little, and even then, unless one's arguing that one of those tragic souls would have been the next Zefram Cochrane, their deaths were not - in a larger sense - consequential.On a more practical note, the Prime Directive is not - and cannot be, I argue - a matter of technicalities. You should have to actually show consequences, i.e. demonstrate that *but for* the alleged violation, the society would not have changed. If so, Starfleet might as well not explore any inhabited planet, or get close enough to an inhabited planet in case someone is looking up at the sky at that exact moment. It's always a risk, and if a Captain or a ship steps into that arena, they have to be prepared for that risk and take steps to prevent or mitigate it. Consider how we've always seen the Prime Directive and its violations portrayed in the show - it's either blindingly obvious ("The Omega Glory", "Bread and Circuses", "Patterns of Force", "Pen Pals", "Who Watches the Watchers") or arguable to one degree or another ("The Apple", "The Return of the Archons", "A Private Little War"). In any case, the consequences are apparent and concrete. The consequences of spotting an UFO in the sky, in the example you give, are, I submit, hypothetical. It may or may not create a movement of conspiracy theorists, but until one can demonstrably show that it is leading to a significant impact on the development of the society, any violation of the Prime Directive would be - at worst - a very weak one, and likely adjudged to be not worth pursuing.

Flat earth being the most laughable, obvious and dismiss-able psych. op. in this vein.

To simply silence them and brand people who dissented and challenged the authority of the govt. and their cronies as unstable, untrustworthy, illogical etc.....This is a conspiracy theory sub.

If you mean 'its impossible for this CIA/Mossad operation to be successful without going to war with Iran' I don't think that's gonna happen. Edit: I believe US/Israel has already infiltrated the Iranian government and it's people are fighting against exactly them.

What the fuck variables are you claiming that weren't controlled for? Be specific. Race? IQ tests? Social environment? Epigenetics? What precisely? is blatantly incorrect. You DO know that double blind randomized trials include a control group, don't you? The control group is the non-zygotic-twin group.Yes. I know that a double blind randomized trial includes a control group. What I'm saying is the population studies of racial IQ means do not control for all the same variables as do the twin studies. Which is why you can't just apply the results of the twin studies as an explanation for the IQ gap between racial populations. &gt; The SAT/ACT being a superior test of both a wider range, and more complete exploration of mathematics is not remotely in question. IQ tests, at best, test five basic mathematical operations.Proof by Assertion Fallacy. &gt; Not remotely like the SAT/ACT, nope.Bare Assertion Fallacy. &gt; 1) We're on the 5th versions of both main IQ tests. They are constantly updated, and there are development notes with this being an explicit goal. There were a number of papers about "cultural bias" of the major IQ tests back in the 70's by sociology "science" majors. 2) The IQ tests have narrowed for blacks and latinos, but objective mathematical ability of blacks and latinos have not.So you have no Source to back up your conspiracy theory. Okay, got it. &gt; Its precisely the same as GCSEs in the UK, Provide rigorous causative evidence that there is a genetic basis to GCSE score gaps between racial populations. &gt; and they are casually proven to be strongly genetically heritable.That doesn't mean the gaps in scores between racial populations are caused by genetics. That's Fallacious reasoning on your part. &gt; Your go-to response when your logic fails is to claim a vaguely connected fallacy without any logical appropriateness to the argument at hand. It's pathetic.Appeal to Ridicule Fallacy. &gt; I've addressed your shit argument about generalization above. No, you did not. See above. &gt; There is a control group, and it does generalize. Wrong.

SO I'll say again, you absolutely claimed that if we don't know something 100% we cannot know it."Probably indicates a non-zero, but not total proportion." Yes, which means I didn't claim that "if we don't know something 100% we cannot know it." &gt; In your delusional mind, perhaps.Abusive Fallacy. &gt; Addressed above.No, you did not. See above. &gt; I'd like you to post a Source confirming this statement of yours: "SATs and AP testing corresponds far better with success in society." Well, thats fucking trivial This Table Proves Just How Much SAT Scores Predict Future SuccessIf its so trivial, why did you fail to do it? Where is the comparison between SAT/AP scores vs. IQ scores? &gt; The only statistically significant study done with a **casual**IQ to race link has been in the UK. Did you mean "causal"? Or did you actually mean "casual"?&gt; Do you really think it will be difficult to find precisely the same GCSE -&gt; success data in the UK?

You don't accidentally kill millions of people and have tons of pictures of it for proof, with millions of survivors all agreeing to it, based on a media conspiracy.  But also undoubtedly, the media overhyped it and made up extra lies too. I mean, that's just what they do.  Look at Mao. Dude killed **&gt;50M Chinese**, more than Hitler+Stalin combined, and the Chinese people (older generation, anyway) actually revered him as a great leader for the reformations he did for the working class... Even though his policies were backwards as fuck and crippled China for like half a century or more.  Propaganda is a VERY powerful machine. There's really no telling what's-what. All I can say is: Hitler wouldn't know how to navigate our political fuckfest, since he has no experience with it, so he'd be a useless president. Hillary knows EXACTLY how to abuse the loopholes and manipulate the people to get what she wants. I'd vote for literally anybody before her, if I voted.	
59	 BipolarReddit	 theredeamer	 2018-01	 ['jewish', 'jewish']	 1514765566	  Risperidone or risperdal/Olanzapine and aripiprazole were developed by Dr. Joseph Mengala (AKA "The Angel of Death") a monster that murdered and mutilated thousands of jewish people during WWII in Nazi concentration camps. He developed a treatment to chemically scarify away the sphincter that the body needs to get an erection - and to hold the intestines in the abdominal cavity. The research in the development of abilify and risperdal involved live human disection of young men which Joseph Mengala was well known for.  Abilify is administered for a 10-14 period to melt the disc that protects this sphincter from the urine stream. The victim is then switched to Risperidone or risperdal which washs the flesh of this sphincter away when the victim urinates. Risperidone or risperdal causes unbearable back discomfort in some victims which lead to the development of olanzapine ,which has the same effect but the back pain side-effect is somewhat mitigated.  The recent murder/suicide of billionaire philanthropist Barry Sherman and his wife Honey are directly related to the campaign to get the truth out about aripiprazole and risperdal. They were devoutly jewish and Apotex Pharmachem Inc was a major distributor of these two drugs. The campaign I began to drag these Nazi castration chemicals out of the closet is causing wide-spread panic. All people that are decent are profoundly effected when they face the truth. Law-enforcement officers,medical professionals and social workers are quiting thier jobs and some have even moved out of the country.

Free market doesn’t force the republicans to vote down a living wage, it doesn’t force a tax structure that penalizes the working class and that doesn’t promote hiring and retention of employees. It doesn’t force ceos to make exponentially more money than other employees or force cities to adopt policies that discourage urban development and infrastructure investment. These are all home grown ideologies and waving your hand trying to pass the blame on cheap foreign labor for the unprecedented greed of the richest handful people the world has ever seen is a gross perversion of what’s happening to this country.

62	 politics	 BibleBeltAtheist	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514765635	 Well, I disagree wholeheartedly that they are unreachable but it's a matter of opinion not fact, although it think there is sufficient evidence with ex conservitives but that's neither here nor there.The chances of removing their institutions of propaganda is a pipe dream so long as freedom of speech exists. It's never going to happen. If if it moved off air, they'd find space online, paper, radio and removing them would only fuel their psychotic conspiracy wing nuts which would further the extreme right agenda not hinder it. And BTW, iirc, fox News won a court case for intentionally reporting news they knew was untruthful and did so by claiming they are an entertainment agency, not a news agency. And the conservatives know it and don't give a single fuck because they see the courts and liberals as trying to suppress the truth and fox did what they had to so they could continue to report the "truth" But let's say youre right for arguments sake, and we somehow get passed all their money and the politicians that depend on fox and their ilk. Let's says that measures are taken that force them to only report the factual truth, they are still allowed their interpretations of that truth which can do as much damage as a falsehood. But let's say that in some crazy way that even that was prohibited, they would still find a way. Any way in which you can propose stopping them from reporting bullshit, Im sure I can find a way to convince you on how they'd get around it.We are not going to beat them by removing their propaganda, attacking those institutions will only serve to promote further right wing propaganda and those people will sink deeper into the intellectual bullshit.The only way to get them passed it is through teaching people how to think critically, there is no other way.As for your other thoughts, I agree whole heartedly. Trump, his administration and anyone else we can root out as having committed crimes against the people need to be dealt with. But  it won't stop the next in line leaders of the conservative right from stepping in and filling their shoes regardless if the dems control the administration and the houses. We have to address why people think they way they do, show them there's another way and continue to be vigilant in denouncing, or worse, those in the conservative party that would use the same tactics to take advantage of their stupidity and gullibility. And just for the record, the dems are just as fucking bad. Trump is an exception of the conservative right and not the norm. The majority of the conservative party and the majority of the democratic party are elitist bastards that work in government to serve their own agendas which usually coincide with the capitalist pigs. At this point there isn't much difference between those in power of the government and those in power from capitalism.

71	 PhilosophyofScience	 exploderator	 2018-01	 ['silencing']	 1514765840	 Of course I don't think other kinds of monkeys view themselves in such terms either, which is of course to be expected because they didn't evolve language, and therefore don't have "terms", don't think or perceive in "terms", and therefore presumably don't have quite the same form of subjective awareness that we have.  It would be interesting if we could ask the cetaceans though, because they do seem to have complex language, thus perhaps think in "terms", including about themselves.But here is where I must ask: what if the experience of meditation is actually something like experiencing being a pre-language monkey?  In simple terms, a core part of meditation is about silencing the inner dialogue, so maybe what we're left experiencing at that point is the wordless monkey part of ourselves.  And if our more recently evolved verbal executive awareness is the primary seat of our experience of sharply defined self-identity, then perhaps this consistent boundless "I" experience of practiced meditators is simply the natural perceptual state of living in the pre-verbal brain, which doesn't make that distinction so clearly in its perception of reality.  But of course this experience is still observed by the verbal executive, which then narrates the strange/"mystical"/"spiritual" quality of that state, as compared to its own norm of usually experiencing a distinct "I".  In other words, non-verbal monkey brains don't so sharply distinguish the self, and when we manage to experience that state, the modern babbling part of our mind that sharply defines the self comes back thinking it feels magical.Now of course, we can't expect a perfect neural correlation between our brains and other monkey's brains, because ours have evolved to be largely shot-through with language apparatus, and even if we can calm that stuff to the point where we can experience roughly without it interfering, there will still be many traces of its presence, and probably of the active calming job we're doing to make it shut up at all.  Furthermore, given our amazing neuroplasticity, I don't doubt that with sufficient practice, we can learn to tie part of our narrative awareness into those subtle non-verbal places in our minds, and thus come to effectively experience something of that mode of operation as part of our ongoing awareness.  Awareness of part of our brain that is not making a sharp "I" distinction.And this is all speculation on my part.  I'm just trying to juggle the bits and see if I can construct sensible explanations in non-magical terms.  I'm trying to use the starting assumption that being talking monkeys ought to be wholly sufficient to explain all our experiences, which we historically over-explained, because we historically underestimated just how psychedelically / holographically amazing it is to live in an animal brain.  Do you construct amazing other realities in your dreams?  Have you ever watched a cat or dog dream?  Why should we assume less of their experiences?

Simply put, if you're poor and uninsured you'll simply never get an organ transplant, however poor people often donate organs. It's an unfair system and shows that there is a major level of inequality in organ donation. So it's a flawed system based on greed and how big one's wallet is. &gt; at least 16.9 percent of organ donors had no health insurance at the time of their hospitalization. In contrast, only 0.8 percent of the transplant recipients were similarly uninsured; in other words, almost all recipients had some kind of health coverage at the time of their procedure.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19069285http://www.pnhp.org/news/2008/november/the_uninsured_often_.phphttp://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=1514702Again, the obvious solution is fucking universal healthcare like every other developed country on earth.

People *having* more money suggest companies can get more. but he should not be saying "inflation is a myth", he should be saying something more like "inflation is driven by greed". Without greed, the only thing driving prices up would be the need to meet costs. If an equilibrium is met where all costs are covered, prices would stagnate.

78	 starterpacks	 DracoOccisor	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514765871	 In the words of Stalin, "Death solves all problems - If there is no man, then there is no problem".Since I doubt you know the complex theory of Marx, Engels, Bakunin, Kropotkin, Lenin, Proudhon, Stalin, etc, I'll give a brief explanation:To Communists, Liberals, that is *actual* Liberals(**a**) and not American liberals, are too wishy-washy to ever get anything done. The common example given is basically something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/n133CBn.jpg). If you allow everyone free speech, free expression, and free right to assemble, then that also means hate groups like Fascists, Nazis, white supremacists, and the like. And Liberals, while disagreeing with them for the most part, will just let them do their thing "in good fairness". What ends up happening, and has happened several times throughout recent history, is that hate groups are allowed to grow and snowball into actual political forces because they were *allowed to by Liberal principles*. The argument is simple: if you don't let groups like Nazis assemble, speak, express themselves, or even exist, then it's impossible for them to take over, oppress, kill. It's kind of a "get them before they get you" sort of idea, but at the same time there's a big difference between them and groups like Nazis; Nazis hate, oppress and kill over things like race, religion, economic status. Communists historically have hated, oppressed and killed groups like that who want to disrupt social order with hatred against innocents simply because of how they were born. Acting on hate is a choice, and I believe that such acts should be punished. Being born brown, poor, or into a Jewish family is not a choice. That should be understood and honored. (**a**)- this means people who support individualism, the free market, free speech, limited yet effective governmental intervention, etc.As for your second question, it does indeed *allow* for the promotion of Stalin and Mao but it does not do it intrinsically. Once you spend a lot of time there, you'll notice that most of the people there are Marxist-Leninists. Actual Stalinists and Maoists are few and far between, with there being more of the latter than the former. But even the Leninists who reject Stalin as the rightful successor to leadership of the USSR will defend his legacy simply because what we are taught in the West about Communism and the USSR are bold-face lies. We don't say "Stalin did nothing wrong". We are mostly ashamed of that blemish on the history of Communism - much in the same way that the Native American genocide, slavery, and the creation of ISIS are seen in America. Instead, we say "You're being lied to. Do your own research, come talk to us in our threads, and don't trust America's take on another enemy country's history as the one truth." But what are we met with? People who don't know and don't want to know. People who grew up thinking that the USSR was a death machine whose sole intent and purpose was to grind human bones into a fine powder for Stalin to snort. People who want to hate, people who aren't interested in the truth, but merely their own preconceived notions. And it doesn't help that the Reddit communities are basically like a "left" version of t_d.Lastly, we also have to remember that one aspect of a person doesn't erase their entire legacy. Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, and yet his face is still on the side of a mountain. Stalin, while being a paranoid, average intelligence, no-wisdom, petty man who had no business ever leading the USSR, also was able to do amazing things. For instance, thanks to Lenin's kickstart and Stalin's follow-up, the USSR turned from a loose association of agrarian states ruled by a feudal tyrant to an industrial superpower in a matter of decades. They were one of the first countries to introduce paid maternity leave, near-100% literacy, free universal healthcare, free universal secondary education, near-100% employment, mandatory vacation, and more.They put a man in space before the USA. They contributed to the Allies' European theatre success more than any other country by a long shot, and they paid for it in blood. In fact, you should look up their war effort. In less than a year, they were able to out-produce guns, steel, and vehicles at a pace much faster than the Americans, the British, or the Germans. Say what you want about Soviet Communism, as far as production and industrialization goes, it was unmatched - and still is, in sheer speed. and after all of this, what were they met with? The USA and Britain stopped sending them food and supplies, (which, along with bad weather conditions and questionable agricultural policies due to Stalin's dislike of the Ukranians) was one of the primary causes for the Holodomor.

88	 aspergers	 AnnaUndefind	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514766028	 Well, your argument is essentially Pascal's wager.  "Better to believe in God, because if you don't you are going to hell."The problem still remains, there are still a huge number of religions.  They all have their own conception of God.  It seems illogical to believe that all those God's are the one true God, since they all have different covenants and different responsibilities.  Amun Ra, Yhwh, Christian God, Allah, Zeus, Tiamat, etc...Granted, Yhwh, Christian God, and Allah are all said to be the same God, but each has a different covenant.  Yhwh = Torah, C. God = New Testament, Allah = Koran.  Christianity isn't even the latest iteration of the "Abraham's God".Ultimately, it seems picking any one religion is a relatively arbitrary choice.  Of course every religion claims to be the only way to salvation.By your logic, those who lived before Christ are damned, and those who lived after and don't accept him (even if they were never aware of the option) are also damned.  I would argue that makes the Christian God an evil God.But even beyond that, I never claimed my purpose was "eternal".  I don't need to prove God doesn't exist because my purpose doesn't rest upon the laurels of any God.Your argument, again, is Pascal's wager, and again, like Pascal's wager, it has inherent flaws.  You accept Christianity as being true because it agrees with your world view, my argument is that any God could be substituted for the Christian God.  Tiamat was, at one time, a God that attracted many followers.  Why not worship Tiamat instead?  Sure, the Christian God would call this idol worship, but that only makes a difference if the Christian God is the one true God.Of course we are not morally perfect.  I just don't see how picking any one God solves that dilemma better than picking any other God.This is the whole reason for "faith".  No matter what religion you follow, you have to take it on faith.Technically, if you believe in Abraham's God, how do you justify following Christian dogma when there is a new covenant?  This places one into a position of cognitive dissonance.It's clearly stated in the beginning of the Koran, that Allah is the God of Abraham.  The Koran is the new covenant, much like the New testament.  The Koran references and quotes the Bible many times.  If you follow the Christian faith then, you are following an outdated covenant.  It's no longer applicable, same as Christians and Leviticus, or other books in the old testament.So either you denigrate Islam, and state it's not the true religion, even though you can't prove Christianity is, or you acknowledge you are following outdated texts.  You could make claims about the prophet Muhammed, and try to denigrate the messenger, but since the New testament itself was written (mostly) many years after the death of Jesus Christ, and if my memory serves, was decided upon by committee, this is a dangerous road to trek.This is the problem with religion in general.  At best, the Bible (and all other holy books), are the pure words of God, spoken by the impure lips of men, at worst, it served as a way for some men to retain their power and status, in their lifetime.It is likely, if I haven't managed to convince you with that, that we have reached an impasse.  I don't believe I can better explain my issues with religion than I already have, it is unlikely you can present to me an argument for belief that I haven't already heard, and found some way to refute.Regardless, if you would like to continue, I'm open to it.  I strongly encourage you, if you haven't already, to look into the history, to become a bit of a biblical scholar.  If nothing else, I do find religions fascinating.Were you aware, for instance, that there is no Satan in the Torah?  Rather Satan exists as "the adversary".  The Jewish faith has a different take on these things from the Christian one.

It specifically limits power as appropriate. We just need to get back to following it.Trump needs to let the system work. That's his biggest problem. He thinks he's somehow above everything. He's not. It's fine to not lie down and take it when people come after you, but Trump acts like he's right 100% of the time and can't ever be faulted by anyone. The man isn't a god. He's not faultless. He needs to stop being so defensive and forceful. All he's doing is ensuring he doesn't get re-elected. People are watching everything, they're paying attention to politics now, which is good. Trump needs to stay focused on his strengths and stop picking fights with every single person because when he does that he weakens his own hand. That's nothing to do with any conspiracy take down. That's Trump himself.

I still struggle with the whole suicide rate thing.  Yes, it makes sense that their suicide rate would be slightly higher due to societal mistreatment but trans suicide rates are off the fucking charts.  Higher than Jews in the holocaust or black slaves.  So you can’t really say societal mistreatment can wholly explain the suicide thing because they surely aren’t being treated worse than (or even close to as badly as)the 2 groups I just named.The only groups who have similar suicide rates to trans people are schizophrenics and bipolars - aka mentally ill people.  That’s the part I can’t get past.  Trans people clearly have some sort of statistically-significant propensity to commit suicide, and actually going through the transition doesn’t seem to help them, so why aren’t we looking into solutions that actually will help them, as opposed to just believing everything they say and assuming that to be the most effective course of action?

Here's a breakdown from the [Tax Policy Center](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/feature/analysis-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act), and the [Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/final-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-details-analysis/), and both come to the conclusion that the middle class will not see much change in their taxes and an overall loss of benefits in exchange for the grand majority of new benefits going to the richest Americans.  What's more, the bipartisan CBO found mostly the same results.  All three predict that it'll increase deficits.The tax bill got bad press because it was a major handout to the donor class disguised as a tax break for all.  That fact was repeated "many, many, many times," so while there may have been scraps given to the middle class, it wasn't really the point of the bill despite what the GOP selling points on it were.&gt;Or when Obamas IRS was proven to have asked Republican 501c3s about the content of their prayers during auditsThat didn't happen.  First and foremost, the IRS is separate from the presidency, so it's not "Obama's IRS," it's just the IRS.  Secondly, that misconception was based off of a misquote, not what actually was asked.  As to that whole IRS targeting conservative groups conspiracy, that was just plain wrong.  The FBI and Justice department both looked into it, and found both conservative and liberal groups were targeted for extra scrutiny, and the Justice Department under Trump had the option to reopen any investigation into such a matter but they didn't because all proof shows that nothing illegal happened.&gt;Even the way stories are framed about trump on CNN shows their bias.That's precisely how I said news organizations show their bias.&gt;If it's Obama's administration the opposing party is seen as "not wanting to work with him on issues" whereas if it's a Republican administration the Democrats are "taking a stand".The parties are mostly to blame for this one.  During Obama, the leading party looked for bipartisan support.  The ACA had dozens of amendments by Republicans that made it into the final version of the bill, and dozens of hours of open debate between the parties.  And then, in the end, it was essentially a party line vote.  Obama and the Dems at least tried to get bipartisan appeal, but the GOP wasn't playing ball.  That's probably why they got the stigma of "not wanting to work with him on issues."Meanwhile, for every major piece of legislation this year, GOP leaders crafted the bills behind closed doors, with only a few select GOP members in on the writing process, and then offered the minimum time allowed for debate before taking a vote.  No dissenting views were allowed, not even an olive branch to the Democrats.  So the Dems don't vote for obviously partisan bills that they hadn't even been consulted on.  Why should they?  Hence, "taking a stand."Just like Trump is responsible for his own bad press, so is the GOP.  People can plug their ears to the fact and claim otherwise, but that doesn't make it true.  And as for Fox News, their only dissenting view is Shepard Smith, who is the only news anchor with integrity on their channel.  They make zero effort for real, open discourse on that channel.  They dropped the slogan "fair and balanced," and even before they did that it's been years since that slogan held any truth.  To try and claim that only Fox News shops for outside opinions is simply bogus.  [Here's CNN's Jake Taper interviewing a spokesman for the Roy Moore campaign for a solid 10 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqEA03v3OtQ).  It's an extremely fair interview - the spokeman says some bullshit and Taper pushes him a bit to flesh out weak arguments.  And that's just from a quick google search.Either way, have a happy new year.

Nothing I can say can change that, even if I came up with an article signed by every endocrinologist that said 99.999% have side effects.There definitely is evidence that 5% is a conservative value, both in academic papers and user experiences (which are evidence, just not statistically reliable evidence), but hey, I stopped like others can if they have issues.And there are other options for hair, which I am nearing the point at which I'll indulge in.  Thank God for medical science and options either way!Glad you get to keep all your hair, and trust me, I would never be against removing an option that grants that.  And I doubt there's any major conspiracy, but I wouldn't mind a very large-scale followup with multiple institutions involved because science is never settled, and data never hurts.  And again, it would just be for having the best information.  Like I said, it obviously works.

I mean, give us all a clue here on MDE; WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?Jews are CRIMINAL ORGANIZED MAFIA that has destroyed every nation on earth...WTF are you thinking when you say 'freeing women' or as your fellow jews would say 'shiksas' or whores?"We Jews, we are the destroyers and will remain the destroyers.

129	 RandomActsOfGaming	 qwertaz890	 2018-01	 ['jew']	 1514766533	 Fallen EnchantressI recommend The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick. It's an alternate history novel about people living in the US under Japanese and German rule after the allies lost WWII. It tells the story through multiple perspectives, including a Japanese official, a Jew hiding from the Germans, and an American antique shop owner. There's also an alternate fiction book inside the story about a world where the allies won. Philip K. Dick's books are all really mindfucky and often deal with stuff like scifi and drug use, but this is one of his tamer stories, but also one of the best. The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch by him is also great if you want a mindfuck. I don't even know where to begin to describe the story of that, so you'd have to look it up yourself if you're interested.

132	 nfl	 bleed_air_blimp	 2018-01	 ['scapegoat']	 1514766543	 Let this season be the proof that McCarthy and his coaching staff are *nothing* without Aaron Rodgers.They get bailed out year after year by historic exceptional QB play making something out of nothing on the field.It's time for the front office to clean house and find a new head coach (and his new staff) that can actually make good use of the talent on the field instead of coming back every year with the same stupid, uninspiring, uncreative, boring, predictable, lame and ineffective playbook.Of course, in practice, what's probably going to happen is that McCarthy will agree to fire Capers and scapegoat him for everything that went wrong in Rodgers' absence. The ownership structure of the Packers is inherently conservative and risk-averse, so they'll retain McCarthy for a bunch of years, and the Packers offense is going to continue to underperform with respect to its talent level, and Rodgers will continue to be forced to bail them out until his athleticism declines with age. A couple of decades from now, we'll look back on this time as one of the greatest wastes of QB potential we've ever seen in NFL history.

149	 conspiracy	 Benroark	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514766872	 &gt; One thought I have is that Christianity itself is a LARP committed by the Jews. If you know your history (I do) then you know that from about 60 BCE - 100 CE there was a serious flirtation between the Roman and Jewish cultures. Jerusalem was occupied, colonized, and finally sacked multiple times. An exchange of culture took place there, in addition to heavy Greek influence.But why would the Jews propagate the engine of their own persecution in the form of Western Christianity? Their non-assimilation within Christian societies, and their non-acceptance of Christ, led to countless pogroms and massacres over hundreds of years, as well as being relegated to second class citizenry in multiple countries.

Make a fully grown-up copy of whoever you cloned.2. Make the copy have all the memories and experiences of the original.3. Have a slightly different personality so that part 2 doesn't interfere with getting the clone to do something the original wouldn't.If you believed three impossible things this morning, why not top it all off with breakfast at Milliways, the Restaurant at the end of the universe?For fucks sake, Top Minds, if cloning worked, organ transplants would be so commonplace that *everyone* you consider to be "elite" would get them, not just a few (along with a ton of other people, but they're somehow not a part of your conspiracies). Memory transfers would eliminate the need for schools of any kind. Direct clone-copying would see the rich able to make versions of themselves to take over their affairs when the originals die, and this would be *done out in the open because it'd be easier to do so than to cover it the hell up.*I realize I've just given them more fodder (apart from why to keep it secret, which again makes zero sense), but damn are people who claim clones are a thing rock-stupid.Edit: Thanks for the gold!

157	 DebateReligion	 kolakid11	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514766918	 "you're assuming what you were taught is true"No, you're assuming I'm only familiar with 1 doctrine. Berean isn't a doctrinal study, it's an interpretational study. Alongside my personal studies of other religious mythologies."So you were taught that Jesus message was to obey the government........ “Again no, I was taught to make my own judgements and interpretations.The trap was to try to see if Jesus would say do 1 or the other. They didn't think he would say both. If Jesus said don't pay your taxes, only tithe, he could be arrested for inciting a riot or any other of the ridiculous laws of those days. If he said pay your taxes, but don't tithe, he would be violating the old Laws, which were still in effect and enforced. With either of those answers he's arrested, or in violation of God's laws. But, since he says give to Caesar what is Caesars, and God unto God's, he is saying to follow both.Or the Bible is NOT the infallible word of God and is filled with contradictions... But that's not what we're arguing. Your logic is trying to apply the current set Christian rules and principles to a situation when they weren't in use. Jesus still made blood sacrifices no? Until his death the old laws were in place, and depending on you're belief they may or may not be still applicable. Stop with the "state sponsored Christianity" bullshit, you're pushing. Youre trying to validate your seemingly anti-government beliefs with flawed logic and biblical material. Thousands of scholars of different political, social and cultural backgrounds have studied this for hundreds of years. And you really think they're all "state - sponsored" trying to push some conspiracy? That's what I mean when I say you're one of THOSE."tax collectors are sinners"Give me ANY kind of biblical evidence for that and I may believe you. By that same logic any government employee is sinning just through their work. So do you believe the police are sinners? Social workers? Firefighters? Are they required to repent daily for their work?You seem to be classifying sin, and implying Jesus classified sin as well.Remember "all have sinned". Or James 2:10, but that kind of goes back into my argument about the Bible being fallible.And yes it's about being around immoral people, not immoral jobs. So in your own words, the people are immoral, not the job. The immorality in relation to the Tax Collectors wasn't because they collected taxes, it wasn't their job like you just said, it's because they were greedy. They charged extra, they skimmed, they stole. That was the immorality.

I’m done. &gt; lets be real clear ..i post in a pro bernie sub. i hate and despise the right wing agenda, corruption in politics and of course the suffering of others for the financial gain of the few. I am most certainly NOT a supporter of the current presidents POLICIES.Good. We’re in agreement there.If also like to add that I’m not a supporter of the current president PERIOD. I don’t support his policies or him.&gt; by following the conspiracy agenda of the establishment you are preventing the clear and accurate analysis of the presidents vile extreme right wing policies and of the establishment dnc corruption and ensuring they do not get punished for what they have done this past election cycle.Here’s the disagreement. I do believe that Russia and the Trump campaign illegally conspired during the election. I haven’t been swayed by the arguments I’ve seen here.That said, I **do** agree with you that the presentation of the debate has been orchestrated to distract from the larger issues.*That’s where we disagree!*I’m saying, “Trump did X and the Democrats are using that as a distraction.”You’re saying, “the Democrats are using X as a distraction, therefore Trump didn’t go that.”&gt; that is on you! the russia russia russia agenda is not to stop trump it is to stop people asking where did the billion dollars go? what really happened in the primary elections? what did the dnc lawyers say in the dnc fraud lawsuit? you know the stuff that actually changes things for the better so that the establishment cannot ever pied piper another trump into office. the dnc selected two candidates this election - trump and clinton ...they defrauded sanders and all the voters in the primary elections and you are here politely explaining where we are going wrong.While I agree with most of that, I believe that’s clouding the judgment of some people here. They are so angry that the DNC is using Russia to distract from their own fucked-upness that they *want* to believe that Trump is innocent and it’s all just a conspiracy.&gt; pfffft i want to scream and shout at you with expletives ..demanding you understand what you are really doing ..but your just so invested in your establishment propaganda that you cannot understand the words being used at you ..cognitive dissonance forever ..right?I’m a staunch defender of Sanders and Sanders-supporters. This is one of the few times I’ve ever had to debate Sanders-supporters who I believe have gone too far. Call that whatever you want. Be as angry as you want with me. But I’m on your side 99% of the time. I just can’t get behind this.

Doctors operate on medical training and experience, while families run on emotion. A doctor is a much better judge of when a situation is futile than a family blindly trying to hold out hope, and as a result it's easier for people to believe that the doctor "didn't try everything" so he could steal their loved one's organs than to accept there was nothing left to do.

173	 skeptic	 beaverteeth92	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514767227	 Apparently there's a movement where people pay hilariously large amounts of money for untreated water.  Some choice quotes from the article, with important parts highlighted in bold:&gt; “Just take a breath of air,” said Mr. Friesen, a professor of materials science at Arizona State University. “Take a deep breath. **No matter how wealthy or poor you are, you can take a breath and own that air that you breathe. And yet water — the government brings it to you.**”----&gt; The most prominent proponent of raw water is Doug Evans, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. After his juicing company, **Juicero**, collapsed in September, he went on a 10-day cleanse, drinking nothing but Live Water. “I haven’t tasted tap water in a long time,” he said...The closest spring around San Francisco has recently been cut off by landslides, so reaching it means crossing private property, which [Evans] does under cover of night."----&gt; The founder of Live Water, Mukhande Singh, started selling spring water from Opal Springs in Culver, Ore., three years ago, but it was a small local operation until this year. Marketing materials show **Mr. Singh (né Christopher Sanborn)** sitting naked and cross-legged on a hot spring, his long brown hair flowing over his chest.----&gt; [Singh] said “real water” should expire after a few months. His does. “It stays most fresh within one lunar cycle of delivery,” he said. “If it sits around too long, it’ll turn green. People don’t even realize that because all their water’s dead, so they never see it turn green.”&gt; Mr. Singh believes that public water has been poisoned. “Tap water? You’re drinking toilet water with birth control drugs in them,” he said. “Chloramine, and on top of that they’re putting in fluoride. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but it’s a mind-control drug that has no benefit to our dental health.” **(There is no scientific evidence that fluoride is a mind-control drug, but plenty to show that it aids dental health.)**

If I buy your couch off Craigslist for cash, I can touch it and smell it and make sure I actually physically have it. If you physically take my money and steal the couch, I can report you to the local cops with a description of you and shit.  If a merchant takes your XRB and *poofs*, you have no recourse. Especially if they're in another country. "OK your shipment will be delivered in 4-5 business days!" - you check in 8 days and it isn't there. You go to their website and it's just gone. Checkmate.  It's like paying with cash if you had to trust people you've never seen to give you stuff you've never seen with your cash. I'd trust Amazon, but maybe not Etsy.  I don't believe Rai can make smart contracts for this service, either. I will have to look into it more. If not, we just need an abstraction layer on top of this to ensure that smart contracts are possible, or that there is recourse for fraudulent merchants.  It just needs time. Until then, some trust will be involved. I like it.

182	 conspiracy	 Quetzalcoatlwasright	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514767417	 Allow me to theorize. The Jews are not the homo-geneuos group we think they are. Abraham himself, the founder of the Israelites, was a Sumerian from the city of Ur, according to the Bible itself. When the Israelites were enslaved into Egypt, they were included into a  group of “Semites”Many of the “Israelites” who escaped with Moses may have been from other tribes. There must be a reason that tribes such as the Moabites, Amorites, and Arameans were kept around so long despite their constant (possibly civil?) wars with Israel. But I digress, when the city of Jerusalem was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar the Jewish elite were taken in captivity to Babylon where many of them would elect to stay for some thousand years long after they had been allowed by Cyrus or Alexander to leave. They learned the dark arts and that is where they wrote the Talmud. At some point during this thousand year period a shift occurred. Jews of the Babylonian variety rejected god and turned to Satan. They went into Russia, back then called Khazaria and forced its people to turn to Jews. Those people them spread across Europe. What I’m getting at is that most Jews aren’t Israelites. They’re just people who are the descendants of Russians or Europeans who were forcibly converted and have been used as human shields throughout the ages. It’s quite tragic. “Jews” killing “jews” = WWII	
183	 readingclassics	 WhenIntegralsAttack	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514767423	 Okay, your first question naturally evokes the elephant in the room: what even constitutes Western Civilization? It can broadly be understood as the cultures whose intellectual roots lie in the fusion of Ancient Greek traditions and Jewish traditions (and Christianity, by extension). For the sake of discussion, Western Europe, America, Parts of Latin America, Canada, and some smaller countries are all a part of this. Now, why is Homer the beginning? The Ancient Greeks uniformly admired Homer, and much of their religious beliefs, artistic output, and philosophy were in direct response to Homer. Also, we have nothing that is universally acclaimed which predates Homer. It's almost as if Homer was a lightning bolt of divine revelation which jump-started western culture. Of course, this is not true, and the oral traditions of Homer's works are complicated. But looking at his works over 2,000 years into the past, it sure does seem like it, and that makes Homer a great starting point.As for an introductory article, I think that's fine. My own feeling about these works, and literature in general, is that it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. There is only you, the text, and your experience with the text. Nothing else matters. As a thinking human, you are perfectly equipped to just jump into Homer and make of him what you will.

They aren't investigating Jews. They are combing through Israeli property records (hence the need for Hebrew speakers) and looking for any individuals who are French citizens who have failed properly report their investments. This is not a "rounding up Jews and interrogating them" situation. They are working their way back from the records to the French citizens who may or may not be Jewish. They do this for other countries as well. The only reason that they had to set up a special task force is that they believe the fraud is much more prevalent. My guess is that some individual or group is going around to French citizens advertising this scheme as a way to save money, some may not even know how illegal it is.

The whole system still has a lot of proving to go through right now. The amount of hype surrounding it turns me off even more than that. I only remind you of TheDAOsaster which almost killed Ethereum. The insane hype around that terrible project should've been a lesson to people, but greed knows no bounds.Additionally I'd like to see how they want to sustain an infrastructure without incentives and how they want to sustain development without self-funding. A lot of projects spring out of nothing and proclaim to be the next best thing, promising to revolutionize the space within couple of months. But Dash is among the very few with a remarkable multi-year track record of success and delivery, patiently building brick on top of brick to have a solid foundation.I'll wait and see.

You don't tell a person who doesn't believe in God that they are a fool and will go to hell. Elina was just always trying to be cool. She was 18 so it may have been the reason, but a Jew is very against Jesus and don't believe he died for our sins. They also don't believe in Christmas. So it was a little weird she couldn't just say, " you're right I am Jewish but &lt;&lt; insert reason&gt;&gt;" she pretended she didn't understand.

209	 movies	 SpookyNinjas	 2018-01	 ['holocaust']	 1514767689	 That's fine. Like I said, I'm aware of what you're frustrated by. It's a spectrum, and there's lots of people on the extreme end that are incredibly inept and apathetic. That said, I've also come to reject condescension and arrogance. I just think it's one of the ugliest traits in people. I'm not going to judge someone by a single post, but you do wonder about a person that seems to think negatively of everyone. I think it just came off overly harsh because you were venting.As for the value of a college education being watered down, I'm still a bit skeptical. Maybe there's been some culture shift towards less accountability, but I think people have generally been the same. I highly doubt the quality of the average college graduate has decreased significantly.In your original post you asked me very nicely to explain, so allow me to re-iterate. I think caution is appropriate in certain situations as a teacher, because you have a position of power, and a captive audience. For instance preaching in class or using the classroom as a microphone for your political beliefs would be inappropriate. Of course some discussions are inherently political or touch on theological themes. The perspective of the christian faith may need to be discussed, or a philosophy course may put fourth the case against religion. A humanities teacher may say things that upset a conservative, an economist may say things that upset a socialist, a sexuality class may be disturbing, especially if you're prudish.This is all just an analogy, because the situation is certainly different. In this case, I think there are limits to what is appropriate to subject people to, in terms of graphic material. While I don't think Trainspotting is as bad as some, but it was certainly a disturbing, extended experience for me. If you're discussing the Holocaust, and show some of the images, people are generally prepared, and the experience is usually not dragged out (nor should it be). Also, people have such respect for the gravity of the event, that they're willing to put up with a lot, in order to understand; I agree there's a double standard here.Anyway I'll answer some of your other questions:&gt; ...what should the professor have done differently?Basically, just not require the movie; make it optional. There's plenty of additional material that can help explain drug addiction, without getting overly-graphic. I actually think these drug movies sensationalize addiction for shock value (less so in Trainspotting though, I actually thought Requiem was pretty heavy handed.) &gt; WHY was showing that film so awful?I never meant to say it was that awful; should have said "pretty fucked up" instead of "really fucked up". I guess what "really" sets me off is the feeling that it's a bit of an abuse of power, inconsiderate, and selfish. &gt; Was it in the syllabus?Don't know. I wasn't in the class. It was my friend's class. Come to think of it, it's possible that it was optional.&gt; Was it traumatic for you?Not really, it was a bit of a disturbing experience, but in a weird way I kinda enjoyed it. It was a bit of a mindfuck and bonding experience.&gt; What did you know of heroin addiction before? What do you know how? I definitely know more now, but I doubt the film had much of an effect.&gt; As for captive, could you really NOT leave? Was it that you saw it, not in the comforts of your home or with close friends, rather with relative strangers?No, I could totally leave, I watched it at a friends house. We were smoking weed, cause I couldn't smoke at my house, and he was like hey I need to watch this movie. Maybe being pretty stoned and not expecting it, contributed. The term "traumatize" may have been confusing, the reaction was more like: haha why is she making us watch this, so fucked up. It just didn't seem like a cool thing to do; i think some people would have a really hard time sitting through material like that, and I don't blame them, or look down on them for it. I think some people get so caught up in what they're trying to accomplish, that they lose sight of how their actions effect other people, and that bothers me.

212	 DuelLinks	 BioMasterZap	 2018-01	 ['greed', 'greed']	 1514767745	 While this is a fun deck, it is nowhere near 70% FTK from my tests. So far I haven't won a single duel, let alone FTK. I feel like it might be better if you ran the Summoner/Wonder Wand engine than Venus.Edit: Okay, so I won a duel but it was turn 4 (my second turn) on the draw. I think Cards from the Sky does slow the deck down a lot. You can't use it if you already special summoned Shine Balls that turn and if you use it first it messes things up. Also, I was using a second Magical Mallet to replace Into the Void but I realize it is probably better to use Jar of Greed or such unless you really want it to be a FTK since Mallet is a -1.Edit 2: So I'll probably stop testing now, but I made some tweaks and it has been successful so far. I even ran into another Exodia deck with pretty much the same build (replace Jars with Blacksmiths) and won. Here is my build: 2 Legion the Fiend Jester, 3 Blue Dragon Summoner, 3 Wonder Wand, 3 Cursed Bamboo Sword, 3 Golden Bamboo Sword, 3 Cup of Ace, 3 Jar of Greed. Only used it a few duels, but I'd say it works better than the Venus version, even if it can't FTK as easily. Though, Cup of Ace is a problem; it can be a -3 or a +3 depending on luck. One game it was -1 for me and in the mirror match I didn't use them at all for fear of giving my opponent the win. I'd probably cut them for a third Jester (if I had it) and 2 of another non-monster draw card; perhaps into the Void even.

229	 history	 fb97e4ad	 2018-01	 ['greed']	 1514768057	 Why is the Gunfight at the OK Corral remembered? Because Wyatt Earp wrote the book on the old west, and he told the public what they wanted to hear: lies. The gunfight is remembered, like many fact-based myths, for all the wrong things. It is shown in movies and television as a clash between good and bad, but in fact was far more complicated. It was Republican versus Democrat, city versus country, business versus worker, northern versus southern, and most importantly it was between people who wanted the west to stay wild (the "cowboys") and those who wanted to declare the frontier "closed" (civilized) and make the new states and territories look more like the eastern states. Finally, it's about gun control; the elected city officials outlawed carrying guns in town because it was seen as the only way to stop gun violence, and the gunfight happened when the Earps demanded the "cowboys" surrender the guns that some of them were openly carrying. Like all stories of the age, alcohol was involved (and opiates), but also greed, ambition, betrayal, vengeance, legal jurisdictions, property rights, fear of change, and the relentless march of progress. Like Grimm's fairy tales, from which we blame the wolf even though the stories were blatant metaphors about people, the west has been reshaped to show us how we wish we were. We believe this myth at our peril.    And it didn't start in Arizona in 1880. America's obsession with the frontier reaches back to the end of the Revolution, when national collective memory replaced the disciplined regular army Continentals who actually won the war with the image of the armed farmer at his plow (still the insignia of the US Army's National Guard Bureau) and the rifle-toting frontiersman. These part-time soldiers typically broke and ran in every battle *, leaving the regulars to stand and die, but the comforting myth of the minuteman allowed every citizen to feel like a potential hero. The idea was so strong that it shaped both national and international affairs, carrying frontiersmen like Crockett and Jackson (and later Roosevelt) to national-level elected office, and sending a citizen-army into Mexico on the flimsiest of justifications. Dime novels of the 1800's romanticized the gunfighter, lawman, and scout **. Target shooting became a popular sport in eastern cities, and traveling "wild west shows" excited American and European audiences with fake stagecoach chases and trick shooting. America gave itself permission to long for the "good old days," allowing nostalgia to white out the endless bad times (and the non-white people) that were really the true human landscape of frontier life. Jesse James became a folk hero, rather than a sociopathic war criminal and bank robber. The "Rough Riders," who were trained and led by the regular army's best officer, reinforced the myth of American exceptionalism by portraying enthusiasm and frontier spirit as war-winners (while ignoring the tough professionals of the regiments that stormed Kettle Hill alongside Roosevelt's well-equipped amateurs). The country's myth of the frontier became accepted legend when the American public, caught in the throws of Prohibition and post-Great War disillusionment, wanted a simple story to allay fears that life was getting too complex. The motion picture industry, understanding that comforting lies make more money than inconvenient truths, took up the dime novelists' crusade to dummy-down the consciousness of a nation.   Enter Wyatt Earp. The retired marshal, miner, land speculator, and gambler who had failed at everything he ever tried, got a job as a technical adviser to the early silent film industry, which would be a lot like hiring a serial rapist as a marriage counselor. Through the medium of fantasy, Earp and the early film moguls reinvented the American west as a simplistic parable of white hats and black hats, rather than the mosaic of competing interests that it had actually been. While emigrants' accounts spoke of disease and hunger, films showed instead innumerable besieged wagon trains (a vanishingly rare event in real life). The term "cowboy," which at the time had meant "drunken drifter with bad habits and unable to hold a real job, and usually not white Protestant ***" became "honest, uncomplicated, salt-of-the-earth tough guy standing up to the dehumanizing  forces of civilization." He was Natty Bumppo for the new age (look it up), a "noble savage" untainted by the sissifying influences of education or city life. Eventually, movies became talkies, but they didn't start telling the truth. John Wayne became a movie star by making war films while getting a draft exemption (Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda served in combat). The television"Gunsmoke" was one of 29 prime-time TV westerns in 1959. More westerns were made during the 40's-60's than any other genre. Cowboys became the knights errant of the plains. "Shane" was the noble loner, calling his enemy "northern" despite the total lack of context. Josey Wales became the good guy, despite having ridden with Quantrill's band which murdered both prisoners of war and teenage civilians. Americans who had never seen a live horse wore cowboy boots and hats. Country and Western music was about 70 Western when I was a child in the 60's, and the game of choice for every white boy was "cowboys and Indians" (I had the misfortune to grow up next door to a large family of Sioux Indians, and the only game I got to play was Little Bighorn). America did what every other society in history has done: it redefined itself based on its myths, not its reality. In essence, America did exactly what the Victorian English had done, adopt an identity based on an idealized and simplistic story in which the "cowboy" (America) is the good guy, and all problems can be solved through God-given strength. The frontier myth is still here, still warping our reality and killing our people. In 2003 a president whose favorite movie was "High Noon" (a fantasy in which a town full of Civil War veterans are inexplicably afraid to help their sheriff ****) took the country into an unethical war hoping to give the voters a short and glorious victory, to meet with disaster. We keep expecting life to work like a western, because we refuse to think about how the west actually was. Hanging in my tent at the Special Operations Task Force in Afghanistan was a "Tombstone" movie poster with the faces of the Earps changed to those of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Colin Powell, and labelled "Afghanistone." Trapped by myths, Americans cling to the frontier identity, and continue to wrestle with fear-of-change wrapped in the flag. It's time we grew up.   * Riflemen were decisive in only one battle, two if you count King's Mountain. Militia failed in almost every fight, even when stiffened by the presence of regular troops. In 1777 American General "Mad Anthony" Wayne wrote: "‘I don’t like rifles... The enemy knowing the defenseless state of our Riflemen rush on... it would be still better if good muskets and bayonets were put into the hands of good Marksmen and Rifles entirely laid aside."** If there’s an incident that proves the power of the western myth, it’s this one. In 1849 veteran scout Kit Carson (the hero of hundreds of dime novels)was leading the 1st Cavalry after Apaches who had abducted a white woman. After 12 days of tracking, the party found the Apaches, who promptly killed the woman. On her body was a copy of the popular dime novel “Kit Carson: Prince of the Gold Hunters.” It was a story about Carson saving a beautiful woman from death at the hands of a band of Indians.*** About a third of real cowboys were black, and another third were Indians and Mexicans. The first cattleman to drive a big Texas herd to the railroads in Kansas was a Cherokee named Charlie Goodnight (John Wayne played him in the movie "Red River," and none of the film cowboys were black or Indian).**** When the Younger-James gang tried to rob a bank in Northfield, MN, the townsfolk passed out guns from the hardware store and shot the the gang full of holes.

And?you probably aren't familiar with incident commanders, if you haven't trained for these kinds of thingsan incident commander can be anyone, of any rank, who just happens to be the first on the scene and assumes control of the situation. "incident commander" is not a job title per se, because anyone can become an "incident commander" in an instant, and/or just as easily pass off that responsibility to someone else and NOT be the incident commander anymore https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_commander

232	 DebateCommunism	 Ostboll	 2018-01	 ['globalist']	 1514768107	 &gt;who are you claiming is deliberately erasing cultures?Various modern leftist institutions inspired by the new left and more and more today unified in an unholy alliance with NRx-ists and other 'new' right libertarian light movements (not to be confused with the nouvelle droite, I'm using the term 'new' differently in lieu of better phrasing). There's of course a schism here but you can not deny that some modern leftist internationalists are more or less in bed with modern libertarian globalists by now.&gt;Which group are you claiming has the power to do that?Erasing a mosaic of cultures in favour of a larger monoculture is quite easy. Just promote altruism and integration to create a melting pot. The U.S. did this often and deliberately in their 'melting pot' where Germans, Poles what have you turned into Americans.&gt;which are factors of neoliberalismI agree to some extent. But I'd argue neoliberalism is new left meets globalist libertarian ideas to some extent in a cultural osmosis. The neoliberals have the benefit of being partially in line with both groups.&gt;race and culture are two separate things, so an ethnostate isn't necessary to have a monocultural state.I agree but race and ethnicity is not the same thing either. Also ethnopluralism is not so much about having a monocultural state (that would be pan-nationalism), but rather about a desire to maintain a cultural diversity through the prevention of assimilation into a more homogeneous superstate, in part by establishing a consortium of perhaps federalized nation-states rather than a multi-cultural superstate (or migrant state) that is bound to end up monocultural after assimilation has gone on for long enough. This lends heavily from the early nationalist idea of the right to self determination.&gt;I think your ideas about how and why the world changes are not hitting the mark.My ideas assumes that assimilation, open borders, post-national superstates (the EU for instance) etc. are in part if not ideological at least not counteracted due to ideological indifference. I'd argue this ideological indifference is at least partially due to the new left influencing the mainstream left in the west, and the libertarian/NRx/neoliberal right influencing the mainstream right, causing both sides to agree that ethnopluralism is bad. It is also easily observed that this trend is clear in the west, but in countries with little or no influence from the new left like Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Argentina, China, the gulf states etc. the effect which you'd argue is 'inevitable' is indeed not inevitable at all since it is actively and completely prevented as these states remain nation-states. I know the new left gets very flustered in particular with Japan, since their thesis of it all being 'inevitable' so far has been entirely disproved there. Given how flustered they get, I think it's safe to say it's also because they *wish* it was inevitable as it would serve their ideological motives if it was. But anyway it's a too long discussion and a bit too deep for now.&gt;doesn't ethnopluralism require some degree of ethnic cleansing and ghettoizationDepends on if it's active or passive, and absolute or non-absolute. You could just opt for assimilation, decentralization/federalization and a more strictly regulated migration pattern to countries with currently 'problematic' 'volumes' (like Sweden). But yes, ethnopluralism+authoritarianism+lack of universal human rights would lead to ethnic cleansing by deportation which of course most people are against unless they're riled up by ethnic hatred and tension.Also thank you for being a serious poster. I have looked into a couple of things because of you!

And with the way Singapore is run, *Benevolent Autocracy* was meant purely as a *compliment* - precisely because it 'gets shit done' in the way real democracies cannot, in the best interests of its country and people, and largely without being corrupt. I have no beef with the PAP -Its a very competent government - but it *is* an autocratic one.Singapore puts up a show of being a democracy just so they can claim they are one, but it's a one-party state with effectively government-controlled media, and, yes, ofc the libel laws to keep opposition in check. Oh, and their GRC system for Parliament seats is a farce to make it more difficult for opposition candidates as well. But it works, and they are the modern example of Autocracy done correctly. Oh, and you can't really compare city-to-city because those other cities are subject to national laws. Singapore is a city-*state*. State being the key word here.

239	 MensRights	 DarthCerebroX	 2018-01	 ['silencing']	 1514768179	 Here’s just a few more examples to help you understand our perspective and illustrate why we are anti-feminist. Feminism and feminists have a long history of fucking over men and silencing men's issues... so yes, they kind of are in direct opposition to men’s rights and true gender equality..Do you have any idea how the Men's Rights Activists that are trying to bring awareness and fix mens issues are treated by feminists?Every time MRA's try to hold an event or conference they are [protested, ](https://youtu.be/PZvUA6hUVok) and [threatened, ](http://www.titleixforall.com/protesters-threaten-violence-and-death-against-international-mens-issues-conference-in-detroit-at-doubletree-hilton/) censored and [many times shut down.](http://m.metronews.ca/#/article/news/ottawa/2014/04/10/protesters-shut-down-u-of-o-professors-mens-rights-talk.html) They are met with chants of "racist, sexist, anti gay- go away MRA". Even academics such as English professor at University of Ottawa, Janice Fiamengo, was trying to give a lecture about men's issues and [feminists pull the fire alarm and shut the whole thing down.](https://youtu.be/FWgslugtDow) **They can't even bring awareness to Men's issues, much less start to address them. How can MRA's fight to fix these problems when they're not even allowed to make people aware of them!?**Another example is one I already mentioned, the way feminists have fought to keep a monopoly on the domestic violence issue. You should research [Erin Pizzey](https://honest-ribbon.org/domestic-violence-law/refuting-40-years-of-lies-about-domestic-violence) . She's a women that created the very first women's shelter. After she had spent so much time with DV victims (men and women because she didn't discriminate) she learned that men were victims just as often as women, and that the abuse often went both ways. When she tried to release her findings feminists fought to censor her. They threatened her, harassed her and ran her out of the country. She went on to co-found A Voice for Men and became a strong supporter of Men's Rights issues.This kind of behavior and pushback is the reason that there are thousands of DV shelters for women today, but only one men's shelter. And out of all the female domestic violence shelters, less than 5% are willing to take in men.Also the [Duluth Model](http://www.batteredmen.com/batdulut.htm)  that was created by feminists which states that DV is caused by the patriarchy giving all men power over all women. They claim that because women are the oppressed gender, it's impossible for them to be the aggressor. These ideas were made into laws that have discriminated against male victims for decades and these practices are still in use in many states today. If you take the time to actually research the feminist movement, you might learn that feminism has harmed men and fought against men's issues a lot more that you ever imagined. There's a reason we are anti-feminist.. EDIT: regarding feminism and domestic violence....Even today, with all the statistics showing that men make up half of all domestic abuse victims... and that women are actually the aggressor 70% when it comes to unreciprocated violence.... .. Mainstream modern feminists continue to push these false narratives that domestic violence is a women's issue and that it's Men that are the abusers. [Katherine Spillar](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/64f8hj/i_recently_watched_the_red_pill_as_a_male_who_had/?st=J70Q01LG&amp;sh=4fb97653) , director of Majority Feminist Organization and executive editor for Ms Magazine, said in her interview for the red pill movie that... &gt; "The whole issue of domestic violence-- that's just another word really. It's a clean up word for wife beating.. because that's what it really is. &gt; Its not girls that are beating up on boys, it's boys that are beating up on girls."Yeah... this is coming from someone with a lot of power and influence in the feminist movement and you could argue that she is a big spokesperson for the movement... .. And yet she has no problem denying the existence of male DV victims and painting men, *and only men*, as the abusers.

242	 AcademicBiblical	 brodoyoueventexas	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514768213	 I think it's accepted because it was intended to be ecumenical and academic. If you want to have a discussion that's not grounded in a particular faith tradition, you need a translation that leaves room for different interpretations. Most other translations were produced by a single Christian or Jewish religious group and therefore are not considered appropriate for academic or ecumenical study.I don't think it's a very strong translation. It's not all that literal, it's not great English prose, and oftentimes the nongendered language actively makes it less literal. But it was produced by academics (Bruce Metzger edited the translation), it was released in the Oxford and HarperCollins study editions from the beginning of it's publication history, and at this point it's the only widely used non-sectarian translation that includes the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Deuterocanonical/Apocryphal books.

He was just as disrespectful about the sleeping arrangement and anything that went wrong was her fault.  he would also not meet her half way: let her sleep a night by putting the kids back in their bed. He would ignore her, just like your husband is doing. He would also make strange comments like your husband about future kids. I know, because I WAS THERE.She was not getting proper sleep, so she was making mistakes: over cooking dinner. He would also expect her to do things for his kids without sleep.   He was using her, like your husband is doing. He was self-centered, but she could not see it. Imagine, if your husband was not getting proper sleep, and it was his SK In the bed. I bet the situation would be different. You are going to be sick from a lack of sleep and the family scapegoat (welcome to your future.) I would leave for a couple of days and see if this helps his attitude. If he does not, it's time to leave. However, my friend's situation got worse.  The sleep situation ended with a knock at the door from CPS and the police. The boy said he was touched sexually, while he was sleeping. She was so tired that the police was treating her strangely. She was not the blood relative, so they were looking at her.  Anyway, she thought it was BM couching their son, or the kid accidentally brushed up against someone.  It nearly cost her career. He was still sleeping in the same bed with his son, even during the investigation. (CPS took note of) She was having to sleep at a hotel, while this was going on and still paying half of the rent for the apartment. He was trying to get law enforcement to let her sleep on the couch.  This ass hole only wanted her in the house to make the kids breakfast; the police also noticed this too.   It turns out; her husband had been molesting the kid, while the kid was sleeping. The only reason they figured  this out... They found photos of children being abused on his laptop, and he was trying to say, she MAY have done this. He forgot that law enforcement can look up,  the time those things are accessed.

251	 Ripple	 NotTooDeep	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514768469	 Smart comment. If we live long enough, we realize that the only constant is change. Change in the weather, the price of bread, who's allowed to marry, and the relative wealth of nations. Youthful USA is sometimes like a spoiled 19 year old. Other times, it's marvelous. This is true for every tribe, civilization, small town, and major city. Humans have genetic needs that translate into irrational behaviors sometimes. No matter where you go, you can find a Kevin.And you're spot on; it is the competition of ideas in the marketplace that improves our world. The only thing I know better at 65 years old than I did at 19 years old is this: it's never smooth. Big changes have big bumps, and some of those bumps can break a change in two, even a good and worthy change, and leave it to die beside the road. Some will cry foul and hold a conspiracy theory close to their hearts. Some will move on because life happens even when you try to stand still.Once you embrace change as a non-smooth driver of the human condition, you can look at the last two week's chart of any cryptocurrency and get on with the real business of guessing, "What's next?"Will we all drive electric cars someday? Maybe. There's a reasonable possibility. The economics and technology are changing in incremental, predictable ways. Will Tesla be the largest manufacturer of electric cars then? That question is a mindfuck that can lose all your money no matter which way you guess. The stock price for Tesla only makes sense when seen as a cult of personality. Over time, the only entity that's always right is the market.The same logic applies to crypto. Will blockchain take over the world's financial systems and expand them to impoverished populations? Most certainly. The odds are fantastic. There is no competing tech to blockchain on the radar. The hardware and software are mature. Big FI tests are successful and shit is getting implemented because if costs far less than the current system in terms of time and money. Will any single coin that we're aware of today become the hands down dominant winner over all other coins? ROFLMAO! That's like sitting down at the roulette table and betting on 29.  Good bet? Nope. The odds are never in your favor on a single number.That's why we buy buckets of stocks, buckets of options, and buckets of crypto. We're hedging our bets as best we can. VCs know this. They invest in buckets of startups with the foregone conclusion that most of that money will never return, but one of those bets will return bigger than all the losses.To answer your question: Why are people frothing at the mouth for a single crypto or two to be king? Answer: for most of them, this is the first and only time they've ever seen such an event. They don't know for sure what it means, but they know beyond any doubt that it means something, and they're excited. Blockchain is truly changing the world we live in. What do first timers do when they're excited about something? They make it the center of their universe and grab hold.These folks holding onto crypto at the center of their universes are fighting for the survival of their first meaningful insight of their financial lives. That's why there's so much bile. That's why they hate on each other. In their minds, the core of the best decision of their lives is in an existential battle, and they cannot emotionally afford to be wrong. Their perspective, in contrast to what they think, is not laser focused but collapsed in on itself, blocking their vision of the risks they take on.So what's so special about me? Not nothin'. I'm the same as these first timers, with one exception. It's not my first time. I watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon. I watched it live. My mom let me stay home from school to watch. I lived in Los Angeles and saw the space program change everything. I watched Chuck Yeager break the sound barrier on the evening news. I saw my friend's dad's machine shop buy one of the first CNC machine tools. I also saw President Kennedy get a schoolyard hardon at Kruschev and nearly get us all obliterated. I heard Dr. Martin Luther King's Dream speech live on TV and also saw him get shot. I've lost everything, more than once. All but one occasion was beyond my control and could not have been avoided. Not smooth changes.Now before anyone gets all dismissive at my geezer introspection, I watched Star Wars twice on opening day in the same theater, and again the next day after hours in line, so bite me, nerds. The real Star Wars, too, not these *.quels. I've paid my line dues. Seen them *.quels as well, but they aren't as life changing as the real ones were. Hopefully, y'all will live to have an experience like the real Star Wars. Now to your last point. The Motown Three are not a cartel. Not anymore. True in the 60's, but they lost their way in the 70's to the small car invasion from Japan. Then they lost their lead in quality production. Then they got it back, almost. Then they went multinational in a big way, but still aren't relevant in some markets, especially emerging markets. Notice the pattern. It's the real business cycle. Up, down, dominance, retrenchment, failure, dust yourself off and get back to work. Same pattern exists in investment vehicles. Same pattern exists in crypto. If you can see the pattern, you'll be frustrated trying to tell those that can't see it what it looks like. Nuf said.

In fact, the bitcoin network has even more incentive to do so that the government you worship, because the bitcoin network is motivated by dollars and cents and not votes. The most profitable use of electricity right now is bitcoin mining and if you don't think that's spurred innovation in clean tech and renewable energy, you're living under a rock.&gt;consume now goyimThat's the point; creating an artificial threat of making your money worth less in the future is not a sustainable nor desirable policy.

Are all the mariners in on it given that their navigation maps must all be fake? My phone has GPS, so that must mean Samsung is in on it too. Is every high altitude pilot part of the cabal? Every astronaut? Every physicist and astronomer and satellite maker and HALO jumper? If you assume for a second that they're onto something, it'd be a conspiracy with millions of people involved. For what goal? What possible common aim could all these people, who worship different gods and grew up in different environments and have different motivations, have?	
260	 AskAnAmerican	 Thisismyusername772	 2018-01	 ['jew']	 1514768584	 Some of that stuff is true, bad education and such. However most of that stuff is on the news, if he moves to small city instead of Chicago he probably won't be killed.  The news like to exaggerate things, do we have bad cops? Sure.  However tell them what if Americans sterotypes his country and that's why Americans don't want to go there. I don't know what country you live in so here's a few examples,  "I don't want to go to France all of them are rude!  I don't want to go to Germany their all Nazis and will surely kill me because I'm a Jew! I do want to go to Italy because all the men will rape me! I don't want to go to Iran because I'll get stoned! (Yes I'm aware that Iran not in Europe)  I don't want to go to Romania because their all thief's! Or how about that some Americans don't want to go to certain European countries because of the refugees?  It's the same as that.  If he obeys the law he more than likely won't get shot. Do the police shoot innocent people, sure but sometimes it because they didn't obey what the cop says. Like a person reached for his wallet or something when the police told him to keep his hands in the air!

Head to the Imperial Chapel in Sadrith Mora (Wolverine Hall)2. There’s a guy who sells ash yams and bloat. Buy it all. Leave the trade and come back, he’ll have more. Buy like 200 of each.3. Find yourself a nice alchemy set.4. Make one Fortify Intelligence potion.5. Drink it.6. Go to step 4 until you run out of reagents (save a few hyperintelligence potions for a rainy day).7. Now you have like a billion intelligence for a trillion seconds. Every potion you make lasts for hours, gives you the powers of a god, and is worth more than the combined wealth of every merchant in Tamriel.8. Make a Fortify Speed potion. Your computer will explode, killing you instantly, so be sure to save first.

Vendors selling cards with the title " SELLING USA NON VBV CARD" the scheme is in that the vendor in time will find out that the merchant website protects itself so it pays for this program ( costs them money) and also customers (customers who dont want to pay through this VBV system) but in the end the website weighs out their losses and if this program would help . so when you connect to the VBV program , it is through a pop up , of which you are talking to the bank . through the merchants site . So its you , the merchant and the bank... where the fuck does bins come into this? bin = first 6 numbers identify a bank . banks are huge .. how does a special number of people in 1 bank be able to be so special to not be vbv? all of the vendors on markets are schemes . which will never end because most people wont go far enough to get to notice this shit , because they never card more than what they need to know . Start reading about processors and credit card payment codes and you will notice a lot of shit from this whole carding world . its cool in a psychological type of way . but so much misunderstandings and lies and shit haha its crazy

270	 Judaism	 carrboneous	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514768671	 The sons of Jacob are prototypes and archetypes for the tribal identities. Not just the names and the blessings, but even elements of their life stories play out throughout Jewish history. (And likewise, Chazal interpret some of Moses's blessings as hinting at specific individuals who are representative of the tribe as a whole).Those aren't uncommon words in the Torah, but it's also not a coincidence. But it would be more of a question if there *wasn't* a similarity between the early blessings and the later ones, because they're in essence speaking to the same qualities.

You also have extreme anti communists who believed that Nazism would've ended communism and "Jewish Bolshevism" as they call it. *And* the Neo Nazism of today is quite different from the extremely German-centric Nazism of Nazi Germany. Mix all these together and you have a far more palatable ideology for a people that were invaded by Nazis.

Probably because their belief system is such that they feel the need to have everyone that disagrees with them follow the very entity that was drummed into their heads from birth as being the biggest villain of all.

292	 conspiracy	 BlueZarex	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514768964	 They Christmas day thing was "our" fault for reading way to much into a damn tweet. The tweet was a pics of a Santa naughty/nice picture. The wish us a merry Christmas and ask for money. The intent was likely "don't you think we were nice this year? How about you donate?" But the internet and conspiracy theorist all went nutso in the head, started to rumor monger that it must mean a dump was coming etc. There was literally nothing in that tweet to indicate a dump. It was asking for money for being "nice" as opposed to the "naughty" entities. You can't blame Assange for crazy people on the internet. If he ever lowered himself and got  into the business of "correcting random people's insane Wikileaks theory's" on the internet, he would never have time to vet another dump in his life. He needs us to do that for him. Its classic jtrig - a psyop. They will do and say all kinds of crazy things to make assange look bad through his "unhinged" followers.

He had several skeletons in his closet that Clinton and the Republicans avoided (to avoid looking like a bully and to turn the Democrats against their presumptive front runner, respectively), and you can read about a handful of them [here](http://www.thepeoplesview.net/main/2016/5/19/this-ends-now-the-bernie-sanders-opposition-research-the-media-refuses-to-release).Granted, this is hardly a reputable news source but each of the claims in the secon half of the article (which I recommend skipping to, the opening paragraphs are just squabbling about delegate math) are easily verifiedEDIT: lol or just downvote, either works.

This lets them be able to feel good and find community in one another while also letting them still support their shitty side because to them, their side only seems shitty because the evil pedophile cabal is simply making them appear that way. They believe that Trump and the alt-right are being attacked because they are close to bringing this secret satanic pedophile society down.

302	 RequestNetwork	 nr28	 2018-01	 ['greed']	 1514769075	 I usually start off by checking if everything fits, there's a huge number of things I go through.Team background checks, advertisement check (if they have paid advertising then I tend to stay away), KYC, professionalism (I had a look at EtherParty's ICO as a comparison, their community manager is a clown and that was a big no-no right there). I checked up Moneytis, I googled for reviews on their existing product, found some Quora answers well before Request was even announced. I went through the whitepaper and thought if the model would work, what it would require, etc.Right now it depends all on Ethereums' blockchain (tx speed), but with Casper coming I suspect this isn't an issue.Another thing is to take everything anyone says suspiciously, you would not believe the amount of shills, there's a lot of paid advertising going (because after all, it gives you the mindset that it's endorsed).If a company states their address, LOOK IT UP, phone them, MAKE SURE it exists. There's tons of ICOs posting fake virtual addresses, phone numbers, offices, photos, etc. Look up the people on LinkedIn, check how long the company exists and if that checks out.You get the idea, there's a lot of money grabbing with ICOs since it's an easy way to make cash. The one negative I can say about Request is that they did not need to raise the amount they did, NO ICO does. Most projects only need a few million, if even that. The rest is just pure greed.Also, after I invested at 0.0002 ETH, Request tanked to around 0.0001 ETH for a very long time (which gave me an opportunity to buy lots more). Always be patient, it pays off. Don't try to cut your losses too early if you believe in the project, stick with it and put it out of your mind for a while. Lastly, only invest what you can afford to lose, anything can happen.

315	 AskReddit	 Pajamarine	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514769276	 Just finished my first semester at college and a girl in my dorm had what my friends and I believe to be episodes of paranoid schizophrenia. She was an intelligent, funny and sweet person and was in our outer friend group but sometimes she would just lose touch with reality. One time we all had gone to get dinner at the dining commons as a group and as I was walking to get a drink I saw her sitting down at a table with about 8 asian foreign students, all of which looked confused/scared. I walked over and asked what was going on and she looked at me with a strange expression I will never forget, she was visibly detached from reality and her usual self. She then proceeded to explain to me that they noticed from across the room that she had accidentally gotten soy milk instead of milk and were calling her a dumb bitch and so on and so forth, she was pointing to absolutely random people and yelling that they were “in on it too”. She also thought people were watching her read a book from outside her second floor dorm window and saying “she is a slow reader”. She was completely convinced several people in our friend group, including her roommate, were involved in a complex conspiracy against her. Our group smokes a lot of weed and that was certainly exacerbating her condition. The frequency of her episodes increased until it they happened a couple times a week, and one weekend she went home and never came back. I really like her as a person, and I sincerely hope she got help although every time we talked to her about it she flat out refused.

Again, I must explain to you stupid Gentiles why the Jews in Washington D.C. are letting the Jews in Hollywood take the fall. First of all, Jews that run Hollywood are a bunch of depraved sex addicts who prefer actresses, or adult males. They are not child molesters. They don't fuck little kids, and then murder them. They like to fuck Gentile adults. But, in the Jewish community they are viewed as "fake Jews". They are not really "Jewish"; according to "real" Jews they are Jewish in name only. They have let their liberal bullshit go to their head to the point that they have forgot who they really are, and they have turned on Israel. They used to love Israel; now, they hate Israel. So, very, very, powerful Jews are going to use the Hollywood Jews as scapegoats to deflect from the real big problem of Jews molesting and sacrificing little Gentile babies in Washington D.C.

319	 ChapoTrapHouse	 souprize	 2018-01	 ['holocaust']	 1514769448	 Right, and most of the socialists here aren't Stalinist USSR larpers. Many of us are simply cautious about the rhetoric used to denounce socialist states because they are often extended to the basis of socialism itself. I don't really try to defend the USSR at all, but there's a lot of debate about how many lies people should be able to get away with when denouncing it. Unlike the Nazis and the Holocaust, some of the numbers put forward are pretty ludicrous; though the end look is still bad. Ultimately, how much difference does killing 5 million vs 20 million in terms of looks, it's still not good.I think in the end, the argument gets for most of the left is how much disingenuous shit we want to allow our opposition to get away with in smearing our ideology. I think Nazism is evil at a fundamental level because of eugenics roots, just like how I think socialism is fundamentally positive because of it's roots of democracy and worker power. I will denounce socialist states that did oppressive things without denouncing their basis in worker control over the means of production, but Nazism &amp; fascism in any form is bad. That's the key distinction I make.

He had a string of successful hit singles in the late 80s and early 90s such as "Right Here Waiting," "Hazard," and "Hold on to the Nights." Although most of his successful songs are slow ballads like these, many of his songs have an upbeat, classic rock style, examples being "Don't Mean Nothing," "Should've Known Better," "Satisfied," and "Wait for the Sunrise". Marx placed himself in the record books by being the first solo artist to have his first seven singles hit the top 5 on the U.S. top singles charts.&gt; Marx was born to Dick and Ruth Marx. Marx grew up in a mixed faith household where father was Jewish and his mother was a Christian.  His father was a jingle writer for commercials for popular products such as 'Chicken of the Sea', which is where Marx got his start writing at the tender age of five. His father also was talented jazz musician, well-known in the Chicago area. &gt; At the age of 17, Marx created a demo to showcase his talents, which landed in the hands of soul artist Lionel Richie. Richie invited Marx to Hollywood saying, "I can't promise you anything, but you should come to L.A." Marx would eventually appear as a background singer in Richie's songs "You Are" and "Running With The Night" as well as on Richie's follow-up album, which included the smash hit "All Night Long". &gt; *Richard Marx*Marx's first album, a self-titled work, went multi-platinum, selling nearly 4 million copies. He also earned his first #1 single, "Hold on to the nights", which he told Songfacts.com  was inspired by a friend who had the dilemma of having met the love of his life when both the friend and the girl in question were already in relationships. He also had several other top five hits including "Don’t Mean Nothing" (#3), "Should've Known Better" (#3) and "Endless Summer Nights" (#2). He later revealed in an interview on 'VH-1 Classic' that his favorite song that he performed from his first album was "Have Mercy."&gt; *Repeat Offender*Repeat Offender  eventually moved into the #1 spot and gave Marx two more #1 hit singles.&gt; *Rush Street*Rush Street's "Hazard" (#1), which depicted a man's rejection in a fictional version of Hazard, Nebraska. He released Paid Vacation in 1994, Flesh &amp; Bone  in 1997, Days in Avalon  in 2000 and My Own Best Enemy  in 2004.&gt; Richard Marx also sang with Donna Lewis, best known for her hit "I Love You Always Forever", on the track "At the Beginning" of the Anastasia soundtrack. He has sung background vocals for Madonna in her True Blue album.&gt; He has served as a writer/producer for an extensive list of other recording artists, including Barry Manilow, Barbra Streisand, Keith Urban, 98 Degrees, Kenny Loggins, Emerson Drive, Luther Vandross, Michael Bolton, *NSYNC, Olivia Newton-John, Sarah Brightman, SheDaisy, John Farnham and Vince Gill.&gt; Marx has been married to Cynthia Rhodes, who starred in the 1987 blockbuster Dirty Dancing and is a former lead singer for 80s pop band Animotion, since 1989. The couple has three sons: Brandon, Lucas, and Jesse. Brandon is the eldest followed by Lucas then Jesse.&gt; One of Marx's most recent works is a song titled "Remember When", composed to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Disneyland. Performed by LeAnn Rimes, the song may be heard on the park's official 50th Anniversary album, as well as selected times in the park. Read more on Last.fm.

It’s called the three D’s, delegitimization, demonization and double standards. When all three of these are present, it is true that it is not about the policies of the government but the inherent existence/ presence of that government or those people from which the issue stems.Do French tax authorities in general have departments that target specific ethnic groups? No? Here's your double standards. Doesn't matter, however, France already denied that this is the case.&gt;  Criticism of the government of IsraelThat's first and foremost for the Israelis themselves to criticize. And guess what, in Israel it has everything to do with domestic policies, mostly economic and religious, and that's completely unsexy for the international media... unless of course they can paint a picture in which Israel is oppressing someone, like Haaretz did with the "sterilization of blacks" hoax.&gt; settlement policies (which do breach international law LOAC: Belligerent Occupation) No they don't, and if you are willing to say that aloud without dedicating even most basic effort to comprehension of public int'l law I ought to ask what kind of "very serious zionist" might you be. I'm not going to give you the standard lecture about HCJ duality doctrine, applicability of belligerent occupation to *states* and the four part test, the Schwebel argument and the criticism of the Wall case etc. Bottom line is, no, settlements are not "illegal" and the type of mental gymnastics people resort to make it sound illegal-ish is mind boggling. Saying the settlements are illegal is sexy, but wrong. The territory earmarked for "reconstitution of Jewish national home" was actually *five times larger* than the scraps we're fighting over right now. The entire premise that Arabs have an exclusive right to it is chutzpa of the highest degree. Here, to further advance the irony, is the very first parapgraph from your link:&gt; The law of belligerent occupation (which from now on we will refer tosimply as the law of occupation) governs the relationship between theoccupying power, on the one hand, **and the wholly or partially occupiedState  and  its  inhabitants**,  including  refugees  and  stateless  persons,  onthe other. It is applicable only in **international** armed conflicts.There is a number of actual occupations going on in the world right now, like the Turkish occupation of Cyprus, which is a non-imaginary, real breach of law, do you see dozens of UN resolutions and myriads of headlines in The Guardian and hundreds of international organizations dedicated to battling it? No? Can you guess why that is? Because, whooptie fucking doo, *racism*.&gt; We cannot shut down discussion about and criticism of our excellent democracy, or else how will we make it even better?No one is proposing anything of the sort. However when you start using the narrative of the enemy - a false narrative, too - maybe it's time to rethink your positions.

364	 AskHistorians	 EnclavedMicrostate	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514770132	 It's probable that there was a Jewish quarter in Rome by the late 1st/early 2nd century CE. From Juvenal's Satire III: *hic, ubi nocturnae Numa constituebat amicae, nunc sacri fontis nemus et delubra locantur Iudaeis,* – Here, where Numa established his night-time girlfriend, the grove and shrine of the sacred fount are rented out to the Jews. Athens also had a sizeable population of metics – foreign-born residents who, although lacking political rights, enjoyed a degree of economic freedom (Jones 1986), except the ownership of land or investment in silver mining. Based on the apparent intermingling of metic and Athenian-born populations by marriage ties, leading to Pericles' citizenship law (Aristotle, *Athenaion Politeia* 26.3) and his own marriage to the foreign-born Aspasia (Plutarch, *Life of Pericles* 37.2), it may well have been that metics were well integrated into the city.

I wouldn’t refer to anyone as a true Jew, I would only refer to someone who I know is a false Jew, like the Zionists. Even Ashkenazi or Russian Jews are I suppose “True Jews” they believe in their faith. The only “false Jews” in my book are the ones who manipulate their people into acting as victims so that they can do the same to the Palestinians, and eventually the whole world, out of some false sense of superiority.

377	 leafs	 nomorelulu	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514770438	 I mean I guess it's interesting to think about but to me, all of these theories about Babcock and Lou playing 4D chess are nothing more than rationalizations for strange decisions in an attempt to feel that we're still going to be contenders and everything is okay. In reality it is possible and indeed more likely that while these are great hockey minds, they do still have their own biases and flaws. We have heard countless times from NJ fans about how Lou was terrible in his last few years with the Devils, and we hear from Red Wings fans who describe Babcock as a stubborn coach who makes questionable lineup decisions.While I do not believe that we are true contenders this year, I think it would be pretty stupid and wasteful to essentially use this season as an experimental year considering that A) we have our Big 3 on entry level deals for the last time ever, and B) this is possibly the most stacked offence we will have for the foreseeable future after JVR, Bozak, and others likely walk in the offseason.And I'm not the only one saying these things - only a few months ago it was common to read comments about how this would be our best offence ever and arguably our best chance to make a cup run within the next few years. This is why I think all of these conspiracy theories are nothing more than wishful rationalizations: you see what's happening with the team and then adjust your beliefs based on the assumption that they have a divine, infallible plan. Two months ago we were a contender because that's what it looked like; now it's an experimental year because that's what it looks like? Nah, it doesn't work like that. We are what we are, and we have many flaws.	
378	 changemyview	 frumpydolphin	 2018-01	 ['greed']	 1514770469	 To remedy the lack of well paying jobs for individuals in small scale towns there needs to be some question of the current wealth distribution in America. I don't know the exact statistics, but isn't it something like 1% owns 90% of our wealth. If these large corporations(which is where money really lies) were limited to some extent with taxing, then there could be a wealth distribution to small  companies such that any one paying minimum wage has a serious problem with employer greed. I'm essentially saying that unbiased aid from the government to corporations would allow for corporations to maintain higher pay rates. This remedies the fact that the current adult generation is being payed unfairly, but once again this is a temporary change, I think, a better one than raising the minimum wage though. This won't result in a loss of jobs, nor increased pricing on goods due to companies needing to provide larger wages to workers.

385	 books	 wjbc	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514770623	 You are correct about the meaning of mystery.  It is a secret, like a conspiracy.  But in this case the Grand Inquisitor argues that the secret must not be discovered.Rulers create mystery by withholding the truth from those they rule.  Ordinary people can't handle the truth, so strong leaders keep it from them, keeping the truth a mystery.  The truth is that humans are free to make their own choices -- but the Grand Inquisitor argues for keeping that secret and giving people no choices, all in the name of security.  The masses of people will live as children, obedient and happy.  Only a few strong and powerful leaders will possess the terrible knowledge of good and evil, and they will guard that mystery.

Just because they were stupid and thought that people from the horn of Africa were "negroids" that had bred with Caucasian people and thus had some Caucasian features doesn't mean they thought any better of you.&amp;nbsp;&gt; The Europeans believed that some Tutsis had facial characteristics that were generally atypical of other Bantus. They sought to explain these purported divergent physical traits by postulating admixture with or partial descent from migrants of Caucasoid stock, who usually were said to have arrived in the Great Lakes region from the Horn of Africa and/or North Africa.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutsi#Origins_and_classification&amp;nbsp;&gt; In Mein Kampf, Hitler described children resulting from marriages to African occupation soldiers as a contamination of the white race "by Negro blood on the Rhine in the heart of Europe." He thought that "Jews were responsible for bringing Negroes into the Rhineland, with the ultimate idea of bastardizing the white race which they hate and thus lowering its cultural and political level so that the Jew might dominate."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_policy_of_Nazi_Germany#Afro-Germans&amp;nbsp;You might want to find some other pseudo science to back up your views, Phrenology and Scientific racism are popular among white people that would see you sterilized or gas chambered or forcibly deported to Africa.	
388	 StarWars	 userkp5743608	 2018-01	 ['greed']	 1514770647	 The problem isn't really the "plot" itself, much like the peequels, it's the execution. The storyline as scripted and executed just doesn't fit with the rest of the movie. Everything is rushed and forced just to make a statement about greed and oppression. I think that's a valid statement to be made, it was just poorly executed, took too long, and basically devolved into a Paul Blart Canto Cops distraction from the rest of the movie.u/Richard-Cheese in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/7mk25l/i_saw_the_last_jedi_again_tonight_while_i_still/drvnahg/?context=3) pointed out that one thing that would have made the scene more effective and fit better with the rest of the film is if Phasma had gotten wind that Finn and Rose had escaped and she went to chase him down. Not a silver bullet fix, but with some other execution improvements, Johnson could have gotten his social justice message across, exposed the audience to a new aspect of the galaxy, and not bogged down the film for 30 collective minutes.

We can say with almost 100% certainty that Shakespeare would have been familiar with The Jew of Malta. Compared to Marlowe's treatment of Barabas, Shakespeare's treatment of Shylock is downright sympathetic. I guess the question becomes, was it Marlowe or Shakespeare out of the mainstream?

SCOTUS is approved by congress, so congress won't accept nominations that don't meet standards. And it isn't like president nominates judges on their own, they have teams of experts to help choose candidates [and political influence from the parties about who to nominate.] The president does not have any real control over individual citizens lives. The president cannot pass laws, that is the job of congress. The executive branch only enforces the laws, and only at the Federal level. All powers not explicitly given to the Federal government are reserved to the states, so acting like the president can start enforcing "illegal things" is pretty tin-foil hat

It would be interesting if we could ask the cetaceans though, because they do seem to have complex language, thus perhaps think in "terms", including about themselves.[...]&gt;  In simple terms, a core part of meditation is about silencing the inner dialogue, so maybe what we're left experiencing at that point is the wordless monkey part of ourselves.You're thinking in terms of mindfulness, not TM.From the TM perspective, ALL forms of thalamocortical feedback loops are thinking, not merely those involving verbalisations, and so, insomuch as monkeys have thalamocortical feedback loops, they have thought and so have "terms" or some kind of abstraction with which they deal with the world.thinking is unavoidable as long as one has *awareness of* activity in the brain as *awareness of" is merely how we label thalamocortial feedback loop-activity.Much of what you call "spiritual" or meditative practice is due to terribly sad misinterpretations of things like Yoga, which talks about *samskaras* — those mental activities that are leftover from past experience that detract from dealing with the present moment. These are not merely "memories," but random thoughts that intrude during mind-wandering rest. In a mature, healthy brain, *samskaras* are minimal, and so don't spontaneously arise when we're not deliberately thinking about things: this low-noise mind-wandering is appreciated as the low-noise ["pure"] sense-of-self "I am."

435	 politics	 cshadd	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy', 'conspiracy', 'conspiracy', 'conspiracy', 'conspiracy']	 1514771496	 Okay so it seems like people don't understand the differences between collusion and conspiracy.Collusion is the agreement of parties, usually in secret, to limit competition and this can apply to the government in which you have secret agreements with foreign nations. This may or may not be illegal.Conspiracy is the agreement of parties, usually in secret, to commit a crime, and this can also apply to the government.Basically collusion is not a crime, but conspiracy is. Collusion however is an impeachable offense while conspiracy is a criminal offense.If Trump asked a foreign nation to hack the emails of a DNC representative then that is conspiracy against the United States as he is using a foreign nation to directly attack the United States. However, if Trump asked an individual and not a foreign nation to hack said emails, then it is collusion as they are merely limiting competition.

The subplot is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Psychological horror most of the metaphors will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Waldo’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these Anthologies, to realise that they’re not just Scary- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Black Mirror truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Robot Ash’s existential catchphrase “I don't want to die,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Doctors and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Charlie Brooker’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.

448	 buildmeapc	 brando_1771	 2018-01	 ['merchant']	 1514771737	 Okay I just finished up. With little to go off of, I just went for the best computer I could build with the budget. It ended up maxing out the budget after I added the monitor and windows and kb&amp;m to it. There’s some tweaks I could make to get back down towards the $1000 mark if you wanted to, but I figured this would be a good starting point. Let me walk you through it. For cpu, I originally had a 8600k in it, then I couldn’t get it within budget so I dropped down to an 8350k. Then I saw that you said you wanted a Ryzen cpu, so I changed boards and switched to a Ryzen 1600. That brought us within budget. Personally, for a gaming only machine I’d recommend the 8350k over the 1600, but this is will be good still. I’ve got a 1600, it’s awesome for what I do with it and the price is unbeatable. It’s a 6core/12thread cpu for &lt;$200 which was previously unheard of. Plus, the AM4 platform should be supported into 2020, so there’s room for upgrades in the future without getting a new board. Speaking of motherboards, I went with a Strix B350-F. I’ve got this board, after spending too much time trying to decide which to go with, I settled on the Strix. It’s got one of the best sound cards of the AM4 boards, it’s build quality is unmatched for the price, it’s got great VRMs, great lan card, and it looks awesome, overall a great board. Can’t recommend enough. Next, we’ve got ram. Since we’re going with Ryzen, we needed high speed ram, as Ryzen performs much better with ram around 3000mhz. A build of this budget needed 16gb of ram, so that’s what we went with in a 2x8gb layout, so there’s room to add more in the future. It’s 3200mhz, G.skill Ripjaws V ram, with a CAS latency of 16, which is an ok CAS for ram of this speed. A side note, it’s in silver to so it looks really good with the board. For storage, I chose a standard WD 1tb Blue HDD, and a 250gb Samsung 850 Evo. Samsung makes hands down the best SSDs out there. Their warranty is generally the longest, their life expectancy is also the longest, their speeds are one of the fastest, overall, the best choice for ssd. If you wanted to save some money, you could go with a cheaper brand, but at $90 you’ll really only end up saving like $20 by going cheaper. Now for the exciting part, the video card. I splurged a bit. I’ve selected a Evga Superclocked GTX 1080. This card is a beast! 8gb of VRAM, great cooling, 1.7ghz clock speed, turbos to 1.85ghz, the best warranty and customer service of the video card brands. The 1080 is a card for 1440p gaming, hell you could probably hit playable fps at 4K too if you wanted. There are cheaper 1080s out there, and if you do some sales hunting you could probably find one for close to $500, but currently this was the cheapest one that had proper cooling and wasn’t a blower style card. If you wanted to bring the budget back down to closer to say like $1500, you could swap down to a 1070ti and probably still have pretty decent 1440p performance, or you could drop my Monitor choice down to a high refresh rate 1080p and go down to a 1070ti or 1070 and save more money. For the monitor, I went with a Dell 24” 1440p 144hz (165hz overclocked) G-Sync. It is a TN panel, so the colors aren’t as good as an IPS panel, but after some color settings tweaks, the colors are some of the best TN panel colors out there. G-Sync is a feature that you’ll never want to get rid of once you play with it. No matter the fps, you won’t get screen tearing so your games are buttery smooth all the time. This monitor frequently sales for $350 or less so keep an eye out for it. For the case, I chose an NZXT H440. This one is currently on sale for $90 which is a damn good price. They normally retail for around $120. It’s a mid tower, but there’s so much space it feels like a full tower. The case is like 90% metal, the build quality is unmatched, and there’s so much room for storage drives you’ll never not have room for HDDs or SSDs. I’ve had quite a few cases, and this was one of the nicest ones I’ve built it. There’s very little plastic anywhere which is hard thing to find in cases at this price. Can’t recommend it enough. For the power supply, a pretty easy choice here. 650w Evga G3, Gold rated efficiency, fully modular, that same great Evga warranty and customer service. Lastly, and I apologize for the length of this but I had a lot to cover and wanted you to understand why I chose what I chose rather than just giving you a list of parts and you not understanding any of it. So the keyboard and mouse. This is a hard thing for me to choose, because they’re pretty personal items. But I’ve recommended the Corsair K65. It’s a tenkeyless keyboard, so it lacks a numpad, but that keeps its size down. It used cherry MX Reds, which are the more gaming oriented switches. If you wanted something a little less gaming and a little more forgiving, I’d recommend checking out the Logitech G810 or Pro TKL. They use Romer-G switches which imo are a bit better for day to day uses aside from just gaming. The k65 is rgb backlit and comes with a wrist rest. For the mouse, I’ve chosen a Logitech G502. This mouse is one of the best. At only $50 it’s got everything you’d ever want in a mouse. The scroll wheel is amazing too, just wait and see you’ll love it. Okay so I think I touched on everything, I know this is a lot, so please feel free to ask any questions you have, and I’ll try my best to answer. If you have changes you’d like to see made, let me know and I’ll see what I can do.

If you’re questioning my credentials, I’m happy to send proof to the mods that Ive been practicing for close to a decade and graduated tenth in my law school class, magna cum laude, so I certainly understand the rules of evidence. And while I have never said all of that on reddit before bc it sounds so pompous, you’re so condescending, it seems warranted. And fwiw, I tried to give you the benefit of the doubt that this attitude was just a one off, but I read through some of you post/comment history, and it would appear you’re pretty much always this rude and condescending, at least when discussing this case. If you’re going to have that attitude, you should really learn the law so you’re at least also correct, or at least coherent, bc as it stands, I haven’t the slightest clue what number FRE you’re talking about because your comment makes no sense whatsoever.Second, I engaged with you because I thought you were asking a question in earnest, but your posts and comments about this case sound like the ramblings of a paranoid lunatic more interested in sensationalizing Maura’s disappearance into some CIA/sexual harassment conspiracy than in discussing facts that may actually lead to finding her. The mods should really give you a disclaimer to that effect for flair so unsuspecting people like me who are trying to legitimately discuss the case don’t get caught up in this nonsense.Happy new year! That’s enough reddit for me today. Edit: thanks to all who supported me in this thread. I know it’s trivial to argue on reddit, but I appreciated the support nonetheless. Edit2: I also want to say, for the record, that I’ve *never* even come close to smearing Maura’s name, nor have I thrown out wild speculation that she’s been sexually assaulted or that ppl interested in her case are only so because of their own sexual perversion, something that cannot be said for OP.

I had high hopes after last year, but you can see in his play review when from a year ago that he was making the same mistakes. People don't realize that Romo did more than play, he helped coach. He guided Dak. He practiced with receivers. He worked on the offensive plays. He created audibles.Daks regression isn't because his play has changed, it's because the cowboys no longer have a leader on offense. Witten no longer jokes around and laughs. No one is there to cool down Dez. No one is there to tell TW how to improve his route. No one is there to identify the blitz or move the line.I don't miss Romo the QB as much as I miss Romo the coach. Garrett is a limp dick and Linehan is raking in an easy check. The team has no more confidence. Jerry cut the veritable head off the snake and now you have a team with no direction.It's not Daks fault, but fuck him for not admitting he isn't ready. His greed for recognition and admiration ultimately ended the career of one of the best QB's to play the game. And if you ever once mention "choke artist" or other nonsense, you're a shortsighted and ignorant fan. Romo is the reason he even had a chance to choke. Cherry picking stats is for baseball fans and boxing.Regardless of how good or bad you think Romo was, he was the field marshall and the cowboys are far worse without him in silver and blue.

I'm picturing poverty everywhere and money as basically worthless because the entity will own everything worth having.

It's not common sense at all, it's a conspiracy theory.I get accusing Ortiz and Povetkin of it, they tested positive multiple times, so it's safe to say they're on that special shake diet. I even somewhat understand the AJ accusations considering how much his body type has changed since becoming a pro. But what reason is there to believe Parker or Wilder are on gear? The former is a fat lumbering oaf with an aesthetically ugly body, and the latter is a guy who weights at least 20 lbs lighter than everyone in the division and isn't muscled out the same way either.Miller and Whyte also wouldn't be good poster boys for what steroids can get you for your buck.Really, whenever I see the whole "Everyone is on PEDs, it doesn't matter if someone tests positive!" statement it just comes off as a lazy conspiracy theory to deflect criticism when boxers do legitimately get caught red handed.

This is a trick the boomers fell for time and again. Sure I don't want muslim immigration, but I have no reason to want to attack Iran.In fact, one sure way to increase muslim immigration to the West is to destabilize governments in the region and cause a refugee crisis. This serves Jews both ways. Israel's enemies are weakened, and Europe and the US are flooded with nonwhites.	
480	 todayilearned	 Werewolf35b	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514772378	 More accurately shows like the Simpsons and Married With Children and the like are the brainchild of wealthy American Jews, who view themselves as outside mainstream American culture.The working class American family is always depicted as a sham, a bad idea, with always a doofus dad, weak, dumb and poor, whose wife and kids don't and shouldn't respect him. The daughters a whore,  the son is clueless. The wife hen pecks the dad, and hates him. This is thier opinion of the majority of Americans. In the near future, as Whites fall to minority status, I wonder if they will begin to act as a minority. If so, there will probably be a cultural reassessment of these  90's-00' sitcoms and a change in perception and questions about what they say about people, who was saying it, and why.This stuff will look like hate propaganda, lookimg back. If America goes under hard times or some dystopian disaster happens and Whites get the treatment they are getting in South Africa (slow motion genocide, confiscation, butchery, rape etc.) will these shows be seen as laying the groundwork by  dehumanization? Look how Christians are presented on TV. Look at Flanders, the priest or pastor guy and the church in general on the Simpsons. They are portrayed as rubes, crooks, false etc. Over the years there's some love shown to these characters, as say Flanders is occasionally presented in a sympathetic way,  but on the face of it, we are clearly intended to look down on them and see them as fools to be mocked. These shows are very often directed/produced/written by a distinctly not-Christian group of people. Thier bigotry shows and thier view is disseminated and absorbed without question. Look at movies like American Beauty, starring a guy we best not mention. How is the ordinary American family portrayed? How about the people around them, like the military man neighbor? The white picket fence, two cars, real estate job, kids, the life everyone I know dreams to achieve, is presented by Hollywood as a nightmare, a lie, a totally empty fruad. Quit your job, do drugs, abandon your wife, bang an underage girl, live for now! Yay! The retired military man next door, a very traditional man you would expect to respect,  has a wife that's like a sad abuse victim, he's violent to his son, controlling, a homophobe (but really gay, of course!) A murderer, and sure enough, if the hammer your being hit with really just isn't getting the message across, they put it in neon lights so even the slowest can put this all together and get it-  he prizes his collection,.....of Nazi memorabillia (let's all raise an eyebrow at him, together.) *Is Married with Children the Judd Suss of our times, hate propaganda, precursor to genocide, and no one can see it?* Reminds me of fallen down. Great movie with Michael Douglas, ahem, nice Jewish guy, but playing an ordinary middle aged  white guy in the defense industry, who responds to losing his job and place in a changing country, speaking to and for the anxieties, fears and losses of the ordinary middle aged white guy, loses his shit and goes bonkers. The movie may have been TOO good, and said too much, with too much articulation. They had to insert a new scene, with Douglas (named "D-Fens" to stand in for us all) running into a real life cold blooded Nazi anti Semite. The movie makes sure he's presented as a homosexual, asshole of the first order, violent, dumb and evil. They must have filmed it and said "Whew, there. Done. We've made sure the audience gets the point and.stays marching in tbe right direction." The movie then continues in speaking for angry White males, which is fine and cool, as long as the final destination is nowhere useful. In the end (spoiler!) D-Fens does the thing Hollywood really wants you to pick up on and absorb.  He realizes he is left behind and the world is no longer his. He is unwanted and in the past. His family best move on without him. He makes his move at the end of the movie, and transmits the core message to the White guys in the audience who are all in with the guy that had enough, confronted the criminal cholos, corporate McDonald's, the cops, etc. So he could provide for his kid and family. He makes sure he dies. That was the message. Whitey. Kill yourself already.

Case in point: how much unnecessary suffering has been caused by the profitability of gas and oil? How much damage is caused when industries with more pollution output cut corners to save money and poison entire towns indefinitely?Liberalism in the US is capitalistic to the extent that it attempts to drive change via market incentives - which may be the only reasonable way to sway an entire nation in a better direction since dictatorships don’t really achieve the best results and only recently in history have there been robust economies that draw on multiple political ideologies that include capitalism but do not let it take over every facet of their national infrastructure.

But if you really believe this, we can bet on it.  PM me your wager.And again.  Mueller's job is to determine if laws were broken and if they were to document evidence for prosecution.  Whether they did some thing unethical is irrelevant.  Mueller is looking at whether they did something criminal.  Here is the letter appointing Mueller:https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3726408-Rosenstein-letter-appointing-Mueller-special.htmlAs for different standards, there's only one: the law.  One side broke it (or at least is suspected of doing so).  One side didn't.  That's why only one side is being investigated.  Again, see the appointment letter.Again.  Opposition isn't illegal.  Every single campaign does it.  Even if they are running for dogcatcher.What is illegal:-accepting stolen property (like stolen emails)-conducting foreign policy before you're in office (violation of the Logan Act)-building a quid pro quo with a foreign power over the use of those foreign emails (illegal campaign contribution).-obstructing the investigation into your criminal conspiracy by lying and firing the lead investigator.Those are all crimes that would land anybody else in prison.  Now.  Again.  Are you ignorant of those laws? Or just trying to muckrack with your whataboutism?  Want to tell us which actual laws you think Clinton broke?And if you think we should wait to see what Mueller states, I suggest you start and lead by example.  You can avoid commenting on any discussion about Trump-Russia until Mueller publishes his findings.  But I don't see why the rest of us shouldn't discuss what is relevant news.

There's always a procession to the funeral home. Like.100% of the time. When a soldier does his body is escorted by another soldier all the way to it's burial spot. People in a profession of arms honor those that die. It's not a conspiracy. It's literally done every time a cop dies. The hospital was filled with cops before the procession most are from that. When a cop gets shot anyone not on duty is called and they all go in if they're not needed for the investigation or on the streets. Firefighters were included in the procession for a cop at my uncle's department the day it happened as well.

Falafel, Tabbouleh, Kubbah, Sambousa, Za'atar ...etc. You surely must have Hebrew sounding dishes unique to Israeli cuisine? Or is the entire cuisine made up of Arabic sounding dishes? Again, I understand that there are a lot of Arabs in Israel, but isn't the majority a Hebrew speaking Jewish population?I am just saying, it sounds weird from an outsider's perspective whenever purely Arabic-sounding dishes are considered Israeli dishes (rather a cuisine with both Arab/Hebrew names).	
517	 explainlikeimfive	 ameoba	 2018-01	 ['jew']	 1514772834	 "Whiteness" is, at the core, a way of excluding people.  The go-to example is that Irish &amp; Italian immigrants were seen as dirty foreigners when they first got here and **not** treated as part of the white majority.After several generations, people forget where you came from.  As long as you dress like everyone else &amp; don't have an accent, most people aren't going to think too much about where you came from.  Being "white" in America is as much about fitting in and being accepted as it is about the color of your skin....unless you're a Jew.  They're always getting the short end of the stick.

The flavor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical culinary skill most of the tastes will go over a typical diner's head. There's also Olive Garden's carb-heavy outlook, which is deftly woven into our national fiber - their restaurant philosophy draws heavily from Julia Child's culinary book, for instance. The regular Olive Garden diners understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these flavors, to realize that they're not just tasty- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Olive Garden truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the depth in Olive Garden's existencial slogan "When You're Here, You're Family," which itself is a cryptic reference to Mencius's Chinese epics. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Olive Garden's genius unfolds itself on their table. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have an Olive Garden tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

There isn't really a reason to consider an older generation intel core cpu, if you are going to buy new. The 8th Gen Core CPUs are just better than even their immediate predecessors.By Stepping down your SSD storage size to 256gb, and your HDD size to 2TB, the budget can be made to afford an i5-8600k and corresponding Asrock Z370 Extreme 4 Motherboard, and a very nice air cooler made by noctua. The ram can also be a touch higher speed @ 2666mhz as opposed to the previous 2400mhz. The graphics card you've previously selected has a "Blower" style cooler, and is thus bound to be comparatively loud and thermally inefficient to aftermarket coolers with large heat sinks and fans. With the aforementioned tweaks to the budget you can afford an EVGA Superclocked 1080 ACX 3.0 instead.I've also switched the case out to a Fractal design Meshify C, which features a tinted tempered glass panel. The budget allows for a case around $80.Finally, Switched the psu out to an EVGA semi modular 650W 80+ Bronze just cuz. The Budget allows for any suitable 80+ Plus PSU costing $70 or less.Hopefully this list may be of some use to you. I think for the trade off of storage space it's definitely worth it.

527	 Morrowind	 rodeoaddict	 2018-01	 ['merchant', 'merchant']	 1514772995	 First, generally speaking: If you're playing a Pure magic user, then you'll want to start practising or buying training for Alchemy, and collecting ingredients to make Restore Magicka potions [hint hint Comberry bushes]. Given that Magicka doesn't regenerate in real time, potions are a must for in-combat Magicka regeneration, UNLESS you happen to have taken the Atronach star sign and are currently fighting spellcasters. Even then, potions are a reliable back-up source of Magicka.In Morrowind, you cannot cast spells and wield a weapon at the same time. It's one or the other. As such, there's not much point for a character to try and specialise in Offensive Magic and Physical weapons at the same time. I'm guessing that in your case, you'll be mainly using Destruction and Conjuration to kill enemies, so this probably won't be an issue for this character.However: Supportive Magic skills, e.g. Mysticism and Restoration, are useful for just about every character. Enchant is another very useful skill to have on just about every character. You can make Cast When Used items from 'any' type of spell school in the game, along with [eventually] Constant Effect items that provide boosts that last forever. To make use of this skill, you will need Soul Gems and to Soultrap creatures to fill them, which requires Mysticism skill or scrolls.Target spells are generally 50% more expensive than Touch spells. Spells that you make yourself also tend to cost more than what you would get from a Merchant that deals the same effect. For e.g., a Custom Summon Ancestor Ghost for 60 seconds spell will cost more than the version that Conjurers receive at the start of the game. Good places to buy spells generally are Mages Guilds, Tribunal Temples, Imperial Cult Shrines, and places occupied by the Telvanni. There are also Healers and other spell merchants scattered around the place, that often have unique spells that only they themselves will sell.That said, the selection of in-game spells can be limited for some schools, and Custom spells may be a better option. To make a Custom spell, you'll need to have bought a spell that has the Base spell effect. So for e.g. once a character has bought ANY frost damage spell, then they can make custom Frost spells, but not beforehand. For practice: You can create 'Practice spells' from each school that cost 1 Magicka, and run around the land casting them for free experience. A cheap Restore Fatigue 19 pts spell for Restoration practice is a useful example.For Destruction: Fire and Frost spells are the least expensive magicka wise, followed by Shock, Poison, and then Damage Health.  So given all of this: Fire Bite and Frostbite [15-30 Damage on Touch] are your cheapest go-to damage spells early on. It's rare to find an enemy that is resistant to 'both' Fire and Frost damage, though there are some notable examples [Hungers in particular]. https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:SpellmakerAfter these two: There are not that many options for destruction spells available from spell merchants. They're pretty much all on Target, and deal damage-over-time rather than instantaneous damage. These are more cost effective than instantaneous spells, but may not be as useful.You'll need to visit a Spellmaking merchant and make your own Custom Spells. I'd tend toward making On Touch custom spells to save Magicka, though On Target spells have the advantage of potentially hitting multiple opponents, from out of harm's way.For Conjuration:As with Oblivion and Skyrim, I personally find melee summons more useful than spellcasting ones. They spend less time faffing around trying to hit people with their spells [which are often on target], and may often hit 'you' with those spells. If you do like spellcaster summons however: Daedroths cast two ranged damage spells that stack with each other, and pack quite a wallop when they do eventually decide to hit things.Ancestor Ghosts are good summons to start with, mainly due to how cheap the base spell is to cast. If you have the Atronach sign, you can provoke a summoned ghost into attacking you and then 'absorb' its Drain spell, for effectively 'free' magicka. http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:SummonAfter this: Summon Scamp, Summon Dremora and Summon Clannfear make for good tank summons that don't mess around. As already suggested, it may be a good idea to create short-duration versions of some of these summons, to keep the Magicka cost down. Another thing: Multiple creatures can be summoned at the same time, so long as they're different creatures or are cast in separate spells. IMO it is more Magicka efficient to summon two medium strength summons, e.g. a Dremora and a Clannfear, than one high-strength Summon, e.g. a Golden Saint. They'll deal more damage, live longer, and are more fun to watch.Other notable Magic Skills:Illusion is basically the 'Crowd Control' spell school, and also contains some useful Utility spells. You won't be able to 'kill' creatures per se with spells from this school, but you can be rather creative with some of the spell effects available. Invisibility and Paralysis are IMO the most useful Illusion spells for general use.Alteration is an interesting skill. It provides magic users with Utility normally provided by other skills [Open Lock instead of Security, Shield instead of Armour], as well as several Mobility spells including Water Breathing and Walking. It also provides two of the most fun spell effects ever, that are both unique to Morrowind: Jump and Levitate.Restoration is pretty self explanatory. Restore Health/Fatigue/Attributes, and Cure Disease. Restore Fatigue is a REALLY useful spell effect in Morrowind at all levels, and it may be worth making a Custom Restore Fatigue spell or Enchanted item at some point. Fatigue effects just about every action you take in Morrowind, even haggling with merchants!Mysticism is arguably the most useful 'spellcasting' magic school in Morrowind [Enchant and Alchemy are very useful but don't involve the casting of spells]. You can teleport around the land using Mark, Recall and Almsivi/Divine Intervention, Soultrap creatures, Detect Creatures and Keys in caves, interact from objects with afar using Telekinesis, and once the skill is high enough, and Absorb Health + other attributes from opponents. Absorb Health is a costly but VERY potent spell to have in Morrowind, as it does not damage the player when Reflected.So, in summary, what should you do? Buy all the base spells you can, make practice versions of them, and get yourself a handy stash of Restore Magicka potions. Oh and if you need money and Alchemy equipment: May I suggest exploring Mages Guild and Ghorak Manor in Caldera. There are some handy surprises at the top of both...

Human Rights Watch has described "extraordinarily cruel" actions by the armed forces, mostly against unarmed civilians.The repression reached genocidal levels in the predominantly indigenous northern provinces where the EGP guerrillas operated.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Drama/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

540	 Catholicism	 TexasTemplars	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514773197	 He's only infalliable when he speaks "from the chair of Saint Peter", or in Latin "Ex-Cathedra"Historically it has been a few in Christianity (Catholicism and Orthodoxy) that all the councils the Christians have held to resolve matters were led by the Holy Spirit - as in God has guided councils to be infalliable and teach divine truth, just like how the Holy Spirit guided men to write the Bible.Catholics just take that concept a bit further and claim that the Pope, who is the successor to Saint Peter, the leader (after Jesus) of the Church in the Bible - is able to speak from a position of authority and declare a divine truth.In the New Testament Jesus Christ gives one His first disciples, Simon, a new name: Peter. In Aramaic, Hebrew, and other Semitic languages this essentially means "rock" (think Petra in Jordan). Later on in Matthew 16:18 Jesus Christ says on this "rock" I will build my Church. What Jesus Christ meant here was the unity found in a leader. Jesus Christ gives Peter the Keys to the Kingdom of Heaven and gives him authority to bind and loose (a Jewish term meaning rule-making)It's worth noting that when the Pope makes an infalliable statement from the position of his leadership he usually has a pretty good amount of backing from the cardinals, his advisors (the potential Popes).Ex Cathedra in no way means that the Pope's political, economic, or other personal views are correct and dogma for all Catholic Christians. It's a strictly theological stance.

If someone said that Odin or Scientology told them this people would think they were fucking crazy.That person is basically telling me they'd torture me to death if they were instructed to by something they could identify as God, and the story of Abraham and Isaac even supports that stance.That's fucking crazy lmao.

They are all publicly traded companies so you can easily find the info on NASDQ’s website. The name Blackrock, an investment firm, consistently sits near the top of the list of investors for both the positive review outlets and Disney itself. It’s not really a conspiracy theory. If one company you own invests billions of dollars in releasing a new product, then would you let other companies that you own say negative things about the product and risk your multi billion dollar investment? Of course you wouldn’t. You’d make sure your other business review that product in a favorable light. It’s not complicated. I don’t know why it’s so hard for you to grasp.

And IT WORKED!&gt;They aren't as big or diverse.India is bigger.  Russia is just as diverse.   Other countries as a whole are diverse. EU is diverse.  Asia is diverse.I don't get where "diverse" means that we HAVE TO ROB the next generation when we never had to do that in the 1950s, 1960s,1970s, even 1990s.&gt;I see a lot more that is different from the 50's than just funding. Such as.. well everything but most notably college demographics.This isn't just "about" the 1950s. The US spent the better part of 70 years NOT ripping off our children - now Ryan not only wants to continue to do that - but to MAKE IT WORSE with double taxation.Why do we have people who want to make it worse? Why do they think double taxation is even moral?Money is money. The big difference is we paid for our children. WE TOOK CARE of our kids.  Now, look at it. Republicans can't be bothered to even feel like America is their country much less act like it.Sure there are people that go around yelling about "communists" but no Republican today wants to take responsibility.&gt;We seriously changed the main countries of origins for new immigrants around that time (1965) and as a result our population is swelling with poorer and more disadvantaged people. Money is fungable.&gt; This is magnified by the increased birthrates among recent immigrants many of whom will collect welfareIf we don't fund our children then they won't be able to fund theirs or have a future.  Republicans today are stealing from America's future - and I don't mean with the national debt that we float.I mean by creating PERSONAL debt for millions of Americans. We didn't do that before. This is wrongWhy are there so many excuses and no ability to look at the problem and agree "it's wrong."Because it is wrong and all the dissecting of where population comes from is an excuse - just like in 1840s when people went around bashing people in the head for being Catholic, and in the 1940s when they wouldn't let Jewish people into their "club" and wouldn't let blacks play baseballs.Well tough. I'm talking about higher education not how much somene has decided to "hate" because of the origin of some other group - but how they are DISABLING America's future!Why can't that stop? Why can't we fix it? It can work. It has worked.  If for some reason conservatives don't think we're the same country then move to some other country that is "the same" and stop taking up space here.

And we were from a poor Jewish community (which seems like an oxymoron to the place I live now).  We would raid the couch praying for pennies and nickels.  One time, my grandmother had accidentally mailed to our address one of my brothers (who lived with my father in a completely different area of the country) a fifty dollar bill for his birthday.  My mom used that for groceries and never told her.  I've always been ashamed of this.  We stopped celebrating all of the holidays...we stopped celebrating birthdays when I was nine.  There was no money and we never knew when we'd get some. This has affected me in a variety of ways, but I think watching my niece who has never known hunger or need or want - On the one hand, I am so grateful that my siblings could provide their children with everything they needed.  I am very grateful that they did not know the hunger we faced.  On the other hand - I wish they understood the value of a heartfelt 'thank you' and 'thank G-d'.

I hope you don't mind; I'm definitely not trying to push you to convert (despite the ironically in depth reply), but I think there are a ton of quirky misunderstandings about modern Jewish life (in general, not just in your reply), and especially regarding kosher. I'd kick myself later if I missed an opportunity to clarify and go overboard with the amount of research necessary. (Also I don't get to talk about this much and I think you caught me on a chatty day).The Spruce has a cool article about [modern kosher practice](https://www.thespruce.com/do-all-jews-keep-kosher-2121845), which says that 22% of American Jews keep kosher at home, and that 83-98% of Orthodox families keep kosher (they tend to keep strictly kosher), and the variation reflects the Modern Orthodox branch and the Haredi Orthodox, who differ from the rest of the Jewish world in pretty significant ways (despite defining how most people see us :/). 31% of Conservative Jews, and (a whopping) 7% of Reform Jews keep kosher to some degree. Only 14% of non-Orthodox Jews keep kosher at home, and about 65% of non-Orthodox Jews regularly eat pork... so you are *very much* not alone in your feelings on the pork issue.There's another cool article from the Times of Israel [about Jewish identity](http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/nearly-1-in-5-modern-orthodox-jews-dont-keep-kosher/), which really elaborates on the differences between Haredi and the rest of the community. It's pretty tangential to the point but the big takeaways are that 1) they're religiously, politically, and socially conservative (which contrasts with the rest of American Jewry in general) 2) they are significantly more insular by comparison and tend to isolate themselves socially and institutionally both from other branches of Judaism and from the rest of the world in general, 3) their practice is incredibly, incredibly strict. I can't understate this - the gulf between their practice and the practice of the next-closest branch is palpable, and 4) that, due in large part to their larger-than-average family size (~4 kids per family), their responses tend to skew the stats that describe the Jewish experience (hence the misunderstanding, I think).Related to the earlier comment I made, only 41% of Conservative Jews and 29% of Reform Jews believe in god with certainty. It's 77-96% for the Orthodox community, for the same reasons as before.

If you remove the 3 votes everybody gets and just count the apportioned EC votes, the result is a Trump win 276 to 211. If you take away the 3 votes from just the Trump states, it is *still* a Trump victory at 276 to 232. That last calculation leaves Wyoming, and 3 other states, with no voice at all and Trump *still* wins.      If you give California your incorrect calculation result of 67 *and* still handicap Trump by deducting 3 votes from each of his 30 states, you *still* get a Trump victory of 276 to 244.

As a consequence people who dislike lolcats &amp; other assorted cat memes truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Nyan Cat’s existential catchphrase “nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

565	 JordanPeterson	 B35tus3rN4m33v3r	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514773630	 You're right I guess there are a lot of presumptions in there. I doubt I can make this into a perfectly clear syllogism, but I can try and lay it out more clearly.First I assume there is a single "moral truth." Some higher vector which human actions should be oriented towards for the best of all humans (or maybe all life?) now and in the future. Second I assume that human experience and understanding is limited and Darwinistically is localized on the individual doing the observation and action. For example if you and I are both starving on a raft and there is only serving of food left my genes will drive me to fight you for it. Similarly if presented with the trolley problem I tend to prioritize my own kin. I see an action as "correct" somewhat subjectively based on how it effects my own genetic line/group, and will tend to allow otherwise ethically questionable actions that benefit my line and will tend to oppose ethically questionable actions that hurt my line.This doesn't cleanly follow the syllogism format, but to me the best way to find the single moral truth in the first assumption is to combine the subjective ideas over many generations on this "moral vector". Those that work at cross purposes cancel and leave the actual moral truth, or at least our best approximation. The problem I just thought of is that of recording and weights. Those view on right action that are silenced by the actions (murders/wars) of others are removed from the process prematurely, and their views on right action under-weighted/under-counted. Similarly societies that develop and prioritize writing first can develop and store more sophisticated moral systems than those that rely on oral traditions that must be memorized. Which would heavily weight Jewish ideas over say Zulu ideas.

567	 COMPLETEANARCHY	 Thumblesteen	 2018-01	 ['holocaust', 'holocaust']	 1514773642	 &gt; Education: A program of instruction of a specified kind or levelYeah this is not what it is though. It's an institution that governs professional accreditation, and regulates what may be taught to the public. It is first of all entirely reliant on a class system, and secondly of all entirely political in nature. If education was what you claim it is, then you are contradicting yourself when you disqualify the people as being too inferior to teach themselves.You are making it into a matter of metaphysics in which we have some sort of special education magic that makes some people more valid thinkers than others. The fact that these people just so happen to all be wealthy and predominately white males is something to chalk up to coincidence. &gt; Obviously, but the point is that without a formalized system with standards to test against, how will we know when they know enough?How do we know it now? Someone just said they did and you've decided that's good enough. I'm saying that you can determine what someone knows by their demonstrable labour. If someone is bad at medicine, then they will no longer be allowed to practice medicine. Rather than having an institution of authority to protect their malpractice. &gt; Sure, and that's with medical degrees currently taking upwards of **8 years extra schooling to get and hundreds of thousands dollars in tuition fees**. **Imagine how many psychos might use this cover** if it was as simple as reading enough to pass yourself off as a doctor to people who wouldn't know betterSo all murderers are poor people then? Please provide a citation here. Because I might argue that considering how medical school and massive debt are two of the main reasons students commit suicide, maybe it's a pretty good vetting process for people who aren't that emotionally well adjusted and really shouldn't be trusted with human life. Generally people who are empathetic and caring end up dropping out of medical school because that's the whole point of a school.Schools are there to regiment and make sure the most cruel and the most selfish get the job, because those are people who are useful to the ruling classes. When you tell a doctor to kick out a homeless person because they have no insurance, then you don't want the one who got into medicine because they cared about sick people. You want the doctor who got in it for the authority and the paycheck. So, again, you're contradicting yourself. &gt; That's very true, but kids aren't likely to discover how to do arithmetic or basic algebra by playing. That's because neither of those things are particularly useful to the majority of professions and practices in everyday life. I self-taught algebraic mathematics when I became interested in programming. But schools only alienated me from the concept. Algebra and arithmetic is however very useful for creating meaningless arbitrary tasks, and gauging which students who are willing to complete them without questioning authority or the nature of obedience. &gt; Very true, which is why education reform- especially in a socialist society- is important. We don't have to make the same mistakes as capitalists, like co-opting education as a worker indoctrination system.Except that is literally why it was invented. It was invented to wipe out the language of non-white people in colonies, to train and regiment military cadets, and regiment workers into being workers. That's it. That's literally the purpose of this institution. How can you _reform it_, when its sole purpose is what you want to remove?How can you _reform_ a shovel into being a hammer? There's no logic to what you're saying. You were just raised to think education has a high significance in your culture which it actually doesn't. Just like televised sports or circumcision. &gt; Yes, historical experts of every proffession have made mistakes.They weren't mistakes. They were intentional actions made at the behest of a ruling class who greatly profited from it. A mistake would indicate they had any other motive besides immediate self gain and exploitation of the proletariat. It was for all intents and purposes a mounting success, and an intended use of the education system. &gt; Contemporary experts still make mistakes,Again, not mistakes. And also that's kind of my point. It demonstrates how utterly worthless and counterproductive education is. &gt; but the fact remains that most people would rather be operated on by a surgeon who has been through a rigorous medical training program and has spent years studying for this momentAnd fact remains that concentration camps wouldn't have existed if people were allowed to question doctors or challenge conventional medical knowledge. In fact, education was used to justify slavery, and the holocaust, and scientific racism. It's been used to justify the native American holocaust, and pretty much every atrocity and modern war since the industrial revolution. So you're over here talking about doctors saving lives, but even those lives saved are just a decimal to the lives taken in the genocides that educated men and university abstracts have justified. Like first of all there's no evidence what so ever that surgeons need qualifications that involve a process as exclusionary and wasteful as education. There's no evidence that they, on top of that, then require full immunity from having their claims challenged by non-educated people which is literally the opposite of scientific reasoning. And furthermore surgeons used to run their businesses at the back of barbershops. For most of surgical history, it's been a working class trade. Not an upper class career. &gt; Again, bringing rich people up against a fellow socialist.A moment ago you said people spending money on education reduced serial killers somehow. ''Fellow socialist'' is a bit of a stretch. You play pretty fast and loose with that whole thing. &gt; Obviously rich people shouldn't have any say in the matter as there should be no rich people.Okay, but then you said this a moment ago: &gt; Sure, and that's with medical degrees currently taking upwards of **8 years extra schooling to get and hundreds of thousands dollars in tuition fees**. **Imagine how many psychos might use this cover** if it was as simple as reading enough to pass yourself off as a doctor to people who wouldn't know betterA moment ago education had to be expensive so poor people didn't go around murdering everyone, and now there is no cost to it?&gt; And yes, everyone should be allowed to examine and criticize ideas. Where was I against that?The moment you divided society into a class system of ''educated'' and ''non-educated''. &gt; I already made my nonissue and agreeance with this stance clear.No, you contradicted yourself with as to what you posted previously. &gt; Yeah, I'm sure they do. Capitalist influence tends to corrupt every good thing it touches.Capitalists _invented_ the education system. There was nothing to corrupt in the first place. It was created with the intention of white supremacist mission schools and military training. Are you telling me such things are virtuous? Because to claim capitalism corrupted education is to suggest education had any virtues to begin with. &gt; "Except diseases still happen all the time in spite of vaccines. You're hypothesizing that vaccines could stop diseases, when we already use them and they haven't stopped every one of them. Meaning they're useless, or even malignant."Except the differences from vaccines are demonstrable. There's nothing to suggest education have provided any benefits for society. For the most part they've alienated people further from their labour and professional goals. Atomised people through competitive grading systems. And stolen billions in surplus value from the labour of the working and the poor since its conception. If smallpox was still a thing then I'd argue vaccines were useless as well. &gt; Just because a solution doesn't destroy a problem doesn't mean that it doesn't help.Yeah but generally it has to somehow _lessen_ a problem, as opposed to causing thousands more of them. &gt; Where are you getting the idea that I'm advocating for current day capitalist style money driven universities?Because you literally said so.&gt; I'm not contradicting myself because in my personal utopia everyone would have access, and so anyone could criticize.That would defeat the entire purpose of education. Education is there to exclude people, and make sure only some people are qualified, and the rest are not. That's the point of it. What you're describing at this stage is a public library. It's just a place where people go to access information. That's not the point of education. Education was invented to enforce class norms, white supremacist colonial settler values, cultural misogyny and religion. That's it. &gt; I'm advocating for a socialist society in which experts still exist and people can trust that the person who builds their roof knows what they're doing.No you're advocating for a technocracy. A socialist society is one where everyone owns the means of production and remove all experts and authority figure through the use of participatory democracy. You want a place where eggheads tell everyone what to do. That's called a technocracy. It's not a place where thatchers thrive. It's a place where thatchers are called thatchers and have to obey the priests and nobility of the world because thatching is considered manual labour as opposed to intellectual labour.

That move alone in those circumstances is enough to provoke the police into opening fire.  While it is a tragedy and i feel for his family, i 100% blame the person who lied to the police.  The fact that you blame training and all police is just proof that you don't actually comprehend the issue on a national level.  You want the police to be at fault to fulfill the narrative you have bought into. You would prefer to use outlying examples and try to prove a nationwide problem, the issue is that you don't realize it doesn't work like that.  If anything you can use those localized examples to try and prove a problem in the local departments. You don't actually need to see a weapon to use deadly force in self defense.  It would REALLY help if you were familiar with self defense laws before you make ignorant comments like this. The fact that you think you would be in some situation like these swat members is laughable, do you go and respond to armed hostage situations as a civilian often? The cops made no actions that weren't part of their training.  Just wait, they wont be charged because of the circumstances of the call and information they were given.  You will call conspiracy and just lump it in with all the "other" examples that people like you continually push and proof of police corruption on a national level. I bet you even consider america to be a police state. You just love to be outraged, you couldn't survive without being upset of something.  So in this case you have jumped onto the bandwagon of over aggressive cops abusing their power on a national level.  It has been over 4 years and people like you still cant prove those claims.  In fact every time you try, you look like an ignorant joke upset over a single example in a nation of over 300 million people. You don't comprehend the rarity in which these instance actually occur because you scour facebook and reddit for outlying examples and then try to prove a widespread problem.  The really sad part is that you wont comprehend anything i just said and will make some stupid attempt at deflection.

588	 CBTS_Stream	 MrTruxian	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514773950	 I’ll respond to your points In order here1. Again it is pretty close minded to not even talk to people who don’t like trump, just as close minded as when liberals don’t talk to trump supporters, it’s not helpful either way2. Again I stated that I didn’t Intend say trump was like hitler, I only compared the attitude of his supporters around him to attitudes of supporters of trump, a kind of worshipping mentality. I did not intend to call trump hitler. 3. I’ll admit my attitude was somewhat condescending and that calling you an imbecile was inappropriate, however what I said is comparable to the slurring of immature insults that came from your comment.3(the second one you used). I’d say addressing each one of your points shows that I’m not close minded, I’d say I’m not dismissing any of your point but providing counterpoints. There is chance either one of us are wrong here and I think we should both acknowledge that.4.I think both of us have plenty of time considering the length of our comments, as far the child sex ring conspiracy, that is not what I am attempting to have a conversation about. We are discussing a cult of Personality.5. I was a little confused by this one, it sounded like a vague threat however I’m pretty sure that wasn’t your intention.6. This one confused me a bit too, Im certainly not into liberal arts, I think you may have naught into the stereotype that every liberal is some political science student. However if you were implying that all colleges are liberal hell holes you are wrong, most college education focuses on hard and applied sciences, which have nothing to do with politics. As for Tucker Carlson, I get the idea you watch him a lot, maybe it’s time to watch a variety of news channels to form a more practical perspective. I watch Fox, MSM, and CNN, which can offer some great incite to what both sides think.One last thing, I would appreciate if you stopped typing in full caps as it makes your comments pretty hard to read.Thank you, hope you have a good new year too.Edit: reddit keeps reformatting my numbering sorry if it’s a bit confusing but I’m sure you can follow.

And I take it you are new to VC, but experienced at Warband combat?Then ignore the usual "purchase wine and wool and sail back and forth." That's for traders, though if you happen to sail into Dorested buying some wine while there anyway makes sense.Instead, start life in the arena. Not for long, 10 or 20 minutes maybe, just enough to raise your weapon proficincies up a bit, and get a few hundred gold.Make sure to pump your athletics skill. It will be very important in controlling the battlefield in tournaments or early field fights without a horse. It will also dramatically affect your map speed while solo (more than pathfinding I think) if you are dismounted.Then, two paths:OPTION 1: TOURNAMENT FIGHTER:pick a tournament city. Nearby, probably, but also prefer one you suspect of having a feast for the multiple a day.Then win the tournament. If you lose, arena again to remake bet amounts, but using commands (order all the men to follow you, stay out of 3 or 4 way fights until the other teams are worn down) you should be able to win, barring bad luck. Remember in the initial large teams crazy melee rounds, you just need 1 kill to advance past round 1 if knocked out, 2 to advance past round 2...so have your team absorb them in the front and sneak a kill from behind.Spear is the bad luck weapon here. Run in a circle and grab something better, or drop your shield and fight two handed with it.Don't put your shield on your back. It weighs a ton in tournaments and having one but not using it kills mobility for no reason. Never have two shields in VC tournament fights.20% chance of getting a special item for a win. Decent sword, AMAZING armor (better than bear lorrica in body armor rating, so a candidate for the best armor in game), horse, or cow (butter now and then is nice, but this is the least useful early game). Stumble on a feast or two and you will get a couple special items.A town with a feast is 3 tournaments a day, sometimes 4. Just rest in town and occasionally click to see if tournament is back. Early morning, 10-11am, and later afternoon early evening are usual. Tournaments will give you +6 relations per win with town, up to 30. If you are feasting/tournament fighting in a town, don't turn in quests there or pay for relations points by buying mead in tavern until you hit the 30 from tournaments.Since the town owner will be the feast giver, talk to him once a day (avoid talking all the time, let the counter since last talk go above 24 hours), to get 2 bursts of +5 relations. After the first, he will give you permission to recruit in town.Always check recruits from then on. This is a great way to get starting troops--with 30+ relations with the town you have a shot at tier 3 recruits. If you do some mayor quests after hitting the 30, that chance goes up. Getting 10+ Norse companions as direct recruits isn't so unusual, and a feast and the accompanying relations makes that possible right away.BTW, I think the heavy armor penalties to skills from your normal armor still apply when fighting tournaments, even though you are temporarily naked. So strip off your armor, shield, and helmet before starting.OPTION 2: STRAIGHT TO HUNTING:Ask mayors for quests, and particularly look for the looters and troublesome bandits quests, as well as rescues.Looters can be safely completed with a shield and any axe. Pretty cheap to purchase. Just line them up so their buddies don't sling you in the head while you kill one.Troublesome bandits or kidnap rescues you can kill with a sling and a couple of large bags of stones. Just shoot their knees out from under their shields, run away a bit, then repeat.Once you can buy a swaybacked pony, you are pretty much set. Forget the sling, slaughter those footpads directly with an axe, or if available a sword. Small vikingr parties are now fine targets, as are any of the melee bandit line, even large bands.Just don't pick fights with ruffians/bandits/the whole skirmisher line. Not worth it except for the town quest, as skirmishers won't line up nicely, and will instead fan out and take out your pony.Note that soloing vikingr longphorts on foot is probably fine at low level (and gives great loot), because the number of enemies is proportional to level. You just need an axe and shield really. I know you want to be a raider, but amazing loot. 10-15k if it is one with elites and you solo it, and probably a nice sword, armor, and helmet for you to keep and use.Dunwic is a nice early stop if you have shield and axe. Hit boar grove for an easy 1 on 1 fight with a pretty good mail shirt as a reward, ask the east engle king for quests (or check innkeeper) to see if a longphort is in the area (assuming you didn't already do the quest elsewhere--if you did, no one will offer it for around 30 days, even if a longphort is in the area), then if there is one run up the coast looking for it (not much coast to search, easy to find). The vikingr near dunwic tend to be elite danish--amazing loot from raiding their longphort, and since they are elites there will be less of them to kill.Keep an eye out for nice masterless men parties. My new character just hired 11 member tier 4 Norse elite spearmen band for 3,500. Very cheap, and you wouldn't mind the reputation hit of course. If a town mayor offers the "make peace" mission, take it, raider or not. The lords who oppose peace are generally the same as give the "assasinate local merchant" quest. Find them in a town, get that quest (maybe don't take it beforehand if possible so it isn't on a timer to refresh), it will raise your relation with them +20-40 (it is +20 even if you let the merchant live), then ask them to make peace as a favor to you. The second lord will only charge 1.5k, so the mayor's payment will net you a 10,500 profit.Once you get a horse (heavy modifier preferred) and briton sword (90 reach), you can kill pretty much any heavy infantry band. Here's a guide on fighting large bands as player cavalry in VC: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1226784348&amp;searchtext=Viking+conquestOnce you get a boat, hit the following grounds once in a while, after they have had time to accumulate prisoners:- danish vikingr south of Britain- Swedish and northvegr vikingr between Norway and Scotland- Frankish pirates near dorested and dunwic- raiders in the Irish Sea.Prisoner rescues will make you flush with top tier units and loot, and you can recruit the elite vikingr you take prisoner.I wouldn't worry about keeping my relations up with the raiders. They are too profitable to kill and hire their prisoners. Be the guy even raiders fear.(There is the point that keeping good relations (EDIT: or maybe just bad reputation, from Eric's correction below) with raiders lets you sell equipment in their hideouts for full value, rather than discounted, but frankly that is such a terrible balancing decision that I wouldn't recommend ever using it anyway. Same for selling stuff in your refuge. Full loot prices break the economy, towns pay plenty already)

This is why Hebrews 5 is so important because it introduces a new obedience to man kind and not just obedience to God's. To put it simply he leaned the virtue of suffering and all of man kind suffers“For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.” (Ephesians 2:8)“… knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ … for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.” (Galatians 2:16)“Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin … for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:20,23)“But God demonstrates His love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.” (Romans 5:8)Look back at the flood and why it happened and you know that no works or faith could save us before Jesus. Now we can be saved, so something is completely wrong with your theology.Another thing is the bible references many many many times over and over that x traditions no longer has to be done because of the fulfillment. This implies that every generation there after has been affect by the crucifixion of Jesus.You should also to a deeper look into what baptism is and why we do it. What is it for?take a look at Ephesians 2 as well.

These games would be far more powerful if players had to really invest themselves into digging through them and slowly connect the dots themselves.Yeah, I think that if I was connecting the dots I'd probably think of a few other alternatives when interpreting the images -- the first thing that would come to mind is that it's about refugee ships and such.In some of the other games, I wouldn't be able to attribute the intent behind them if I was seeing them out of context. The game "Train" is structured in such a way that, in a vacuum, I wouldn't be able to tell what the intent was -- play the game and reveal the the train you're putting people on is actually a train to Auschwitz. Yet an identical game could be either a moral created by social justice advocate who believes everyone is complicit in historical events because they either aren't informed/are ignorant, or a morbid punchline created by Holocaust denier who believes that people are informed with information without being able to question whether it follows. I don't blame Romero for putting the games in context -- god knows we've gotta find an audience -- but I do regret that context does detract from them.	
603	 TopMindsOfReddit	 MetaBotch	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514774161	 A clone is a genetic duplicate of a pre-existing individual organism. Cloning is not as far-fetched as it sounds, it's most common place in agriculture such as bananas where each, individual banana tree is a duplicate. Mammal cloning is more advanced and requires taking the nucleus of a somatic cell from a grown individual, removing the nucleus of a donor egg cell, and then placing the stem cell nucleus inside the egg. This causes the egg to start dividing like a normal egg and in 9 months you'll have a brand new human who is genetically identical to normal human. Human cloning is possible but banned for ethical reasons but the realities of human cloning make this conspiracy absurd. Like I implied earlier, a clone is never a full grown adult, a clone always grows and developes as a normal infant from a single egg cell. The other problem with cloning is that DNA ages each time it's copied. So if you take the DNA of a grown human who is already through half of his life and clone it into a new baby, that baby's DNA is still 40 years old, which means that baby will not live longer than 20-30 years and will display symptoms similar to progeria. So since Dave Chappelle is not a little Benjamin Button kid, I must conclude that he has not been cloned.

615	 TrueChristian	 notallarewelcome	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514774428	 Depending on how you look at it, you can say that several verses imply that the "Spirit" of God is in fact 7 fold, perhaps more.So you could say that one of them is a spirit of wisdom, but to make such a statement requires additional information that isn't fully supported by the bible. For example Isaiah 11:2 is a good verse, but its not 100% clear if all those things are separate manifestations of the Spirit of God, or if they are separate Spirits.Anyhow, the verbiage you use "wisdom is a personal spirit" you should not listen to personal spirits, you must test everything. If something tries to present itself to you as a spirit of XZY, rather than an angel from God or the Holy Spirit of God, I would be Most suspicious. Anyhow the whole conspiracy of the Christian faith is that the Holy Spirit is actually dwelling in you, so He is always present. You don't have to wait 21 days for an angel to show up, as Daniel did on one occasion, and you don't have to wait for a prophet to be sent to you, because God can speak to you directly.So while you should pray for the spiritual gifts and or pray that God cause you to become mature, as far as i can tell: spiritual gifts concern other people. If you need wisdom then ask God for wisdom, as James says. But a spiritual gift of wisdom is to be used for the edification of the body of Christ, as is prophecy, healing, etc, these are all outward actions not inward thoughts. and yes wisdom is personified as a woman, because finding a wife is a wise thing to do, but there are no female spirits of God.

628	 GCdebatesQT	 itazurakko	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514774608	 This is pretty much where I'm at too. I wear what I like, I am not trying to "dress like a man" or hoping I'm seen as a man or anything of the sort. I just don't like "femmy" stuff.I'll add though... I think that there’s a certain… "put together” look, for men, in the United States at least, that is put together, and yet, non-revealing, non-sexualized.Things coded "feminine" though, if it’s going to be "formal" or "put together" at all, tends to go for the revealing, at least in the US. It's sexualized. Cleavage, thin flimsy material, dresses that are hard to move in, strange painful shoes.So if you’re not wanting that, but you want to be "put together," then going for some semblance of what gets called “male fashion” is an easy choice, but that doesn’t mean that people who do that are necessarily trying to "dress like men."The other option is of course the pant suit (or even a long skirt suit) but again if you wear flat shoes (wingtips!) with it, you'll be marked as odd or religious. I'm personally ok with that. Of course people do make fun of women in pantsuits at the first opportunity. Just ask any women politicians.FWIW I find that back in Japan it's easier to find some clothing that's "femmy" (in that it's clearly marketed to women and women are the ones wearing it) that isn't so sexualized. Material is stiffer, no cleavage, layers. "Sporty" I guess. Same sort of button-down with sweaters and hoodies that "mens wear" has. Some of this fashion does seem to be making it to the US recently.I do wear skirts on occasion, but long ones that don't restrict my movement and that are casual.  Generally I either buy them back in Japan or else at Jewish stores. So you can find me in a button down shirt, sweater, long skirt. Maybe I look like I'm time travelling from the 50s. I don't care, it's just what I like.I've never had any attraction to the "feminine" look, so it's not anything I had to somehow "give up in principle" or anything.  I just kept on dressing the way I want, even if I looked weird. And occasionally I got into some clothes that looked really crazy, but hey, I was happy.	
629	 marxism_101	 abcd192811	 2018-01	 ['greed']	 1514774613	 &gt;many charities are actually for tax evasion purposes, so it still isn't the best argumentIt seems like you subscribe to a deontological view? In my opinion it doesn't really matter the reason for the philanthropy. If we are criticizing Capitalism as a system then tax deduction is just another component of the system balancing out its negative aspects so it should be viewed as a whole. And Bill Gates for example is donating his entire fortune to charity on his death so it can be a genuine feeling as well.But I think this is getting away from the point. You say that "class interest is still to accumulate", but why is this so? I cannot see myself or most people I know endlessly pursuing capital after I/they had "enough" if I/they were in the shoes of a capitalist, at least not without some outside force like competition. And I don't think that capitalists are some kind of extra evil subsection of humanity either (if we assume that people are not born evil) they are normal people like you and I. So is there something in their environment that shapes them to be that way, or is greed a natural human emotion, or is there some outside force (other than competition) that causes capitalists to endlessly accumulate, or maybe some other reason all together? We need to have something as a starting point.

Also I plan  to write a note for friends who are kosher, or vegan explaining that we have special meals for them should they be able to make it.Also i will put a plum colored belly band around the suite to keep all the cards together in the main envelope so hopefully nothing is lost when the invitation is opened. And the RSVP envelopes will be pre stamped of course :)

636	 politics	 AlwaysTrustPolls	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514774723	 &gt;If we don't fund our children then they won't be able to fund theirs or have a future. Republicans today are stealing from America's future - and I don't mean with the national debt that we float.I mean by creating PERSONAL debt for millions of Americans. We didn't do that before. This is wrongWhy are there so many excuses and no ability to look at the problem and agree "it's wrong."Because it is wrong and all the dissecting of where population comes from is an excuse - just like in 1840s when people went around bashing people in the head for being Catholic, and in the 1940s when they wouldn't let Jewish people into their "club" and wouldn't let blacks play baseballs.----------You are all over the map here. First of all no one forced anyone to go into personal debt. Its a choice. Its an investment not a guarantee. If you want more money with the government why not support "double taxation"?Liberals refuse to even look at immigration. As if even mentioning it could be a thought crime. Here is the reality. The USA was historically a country of European immigrants and we still had infighting even though Europe's borders have been fairly stable and they have all gotten along pretty well such that it is one of the safest areas in the world. Since 1965 most immigrants have not come from Europe, but instead Latin America and Asia. Before we get into the effects of this change think about why. Its something no country had ever done. Why was this a good change? Why was this a necessary change? Asking your opinion?Now the effects: Being a recent immigrant is hard, its that much harder when your home county shares little culture with your new country. This often leads to lower financial success. We have basically created a semi permanent under class of society to provide cheap labor. Something the donors of both parties seem to enjoy. Its not about "hate" or "racism" its about common sense and protecting the country our parents built. Again SUPPLY AND DEMAND. The amount of third world people that would love to immigrate to the USA can not compare with the amount of people we could sustain. Why shouldn't immigrants be selected based on quality instead of lottery? Do you feel that because we are a nation of immigrants that means we can never have any right to control our borders?While I understand you are very partisan you should remember than democrats have done very little to eliminate student debt as well.

Kinda like the theory that the government is working on grain sized cameras, that would be scattered across cities to provide more surveillance. (Which i admit sounds absolutely ridiculous, until you see something like [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/singularityhub.com/2016/06/28/smart-dust-is-coming-new-camera-is-the-size-of-a-grain-of-salt/amp/) is possible to make)Again, i don't really believe either of these theories, they just seem plausible enough to make me uncomfortable.

And apparently Qui-Gon couldn't just mind-trick a non-Toydarian merchant into giving them money that Watto would use, or just take the parts by force, or trade in the old ship for a less expensive one, or... Let's face it, the prequels are just overloaded with plot holes. (And I say that as someone who actually kinda likes them. Sometimes.) The more I learn about their creation, the more I realize that they're one long string of Lucas trying to get out of corners that he wrote himself into. Take Padme, for instance. He wanted Anakin being parted from his mother to be traumatic for him, so Anakin had to be young. But Episode II needed to have him marry Padme, so she needed to be introduced in Episode I. But it would be weird for her to be a fully-grown adult while he hadn't hit puberty, so he made her age closer to his. But she needed to be the leader of the Naboo, so he justified her authority by making her royalty. But she needed to stay relevant in a leadership position in Episodes II-III, so he made her a Senator. But a queen can't just abandon her people, so he made her an *elected* queen. And that's how we ended up with a teenager elected queen of an entire planet. I'm not sure where I was going with this, but the point is that the prequels are kind of a hot mess when it comes to justifying their plot points. Edit: if you're interested in learning more about Lucas' creative process for the first 6 movies, I highly recommend SFDebris' recently-completed series about them:- [The Hero's Journey](http://sfdebris.com/videos/special/herosjourney.php) (Episode IV)- [The Shadow's Journey](http://sfdebris.com/videos/special/shadowsjourney.php) (Episodes V-VI)- [The Hermit's Journey](http://sfdebris.com/videos/special/hermitsjourney.php) (Episodes I-III)

651	 politics	 ChronicYonik	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514774994	 &gt; I didn't say there was a problem or that I wouldn't accept it.But many people from your crowd, including many in this very thread/sub, have already flat out admitted that they won't. They've already said that if Mueller exonerates Trump, that they'll just pick something else to criticize Trump about and continue on with this ridiculous witch hunt, with the aim of delegitimizing and hopefully getting him kick out of office...&gt; Just bear in mind that if Mueller does nail Trump to the wall a large segment of the pro-Trump population (inevitably jeered on by Trump himself) will refuse to believe it, so you better be JUST AS READY to fight that horseshit if it goes on too.What's really ironic is that democrats/liberals were saying this would happen if Trump were to lose during the elections. In fact, as you probably remember, the left was *positive* that Trump was going to lose, and the mainstream narrative was already being pushed that the country must prepare for a violent outburst from Trump supporters.And guess what the fuck happened when Trump won lol? What group of people has been protesting, rioting, inciting violence, and refusing to accept the results of the election from the very day Trump won all the way to present day? What group of people were absolutely positive that the elections couldn't be rigged, and that Trump supporters were stupid conspiracy theorists for doubting our democratic process, but the moment Trump won, these same people did a complete 180 and started saying the elections are illegitimate?I'm sorry man, but I just can't take the far left, anti-Trump liberal crowd seriously. These people are a complete embarrassment, joke, and threat to our country and democracy. They are hypocritical, aggressive people, with either zero self awareness of their hypocritical, shameful stupidity, or know exactly what they're doing, but just outright don't give a shit.I'm honestly not worried at all how Trump supporters would react in the hypothetical scenario of Mueller pressing charges against Trump, resulting in his impeachment. If Mueller has solid, justifiable evidence that Trump, indeed, committed crimes, I assure you that the average Trump supporter isn't going to act even half as violent and crazy as the anti-Trump left has been acting since Trump's victory. In fact, I'm more worried about how these anti-Trumpers are going to react in the scenario that Mueller *exonerates* Trump and declares that he's innocent. These people have already reacted with violence and insanity when Trump was *democratically* elected, so there's no telling how they'll react if their only hope of getting him kicked out of office is taken away from them. Just watch how quickly Mueller changes from their sweetheart hero into a traitorous villain in their eyes. It'll be just like how they treated Comey. When he was investigating Clinton, he was an evil republican that was meddling in our democracy, but when he exonerated her, he was suddenly a great guy who did his job... but when he reopened the email case again due to the emergence of new suspicious emails, he was suddenly a traitor to our democracy again lol

So far you've done the following:"I work with jet fuel (Jet A-1 as F-34/F-37) and during my training one of the cases we studied was the subject flight, BA38. I run a tight system, everything from my receiving the fuel from the refinery, to how I store and filter it, through to my sending it to the tenders for user dispensing, is closely monitored and maintained. We regularly test our system and tanks, have specialists who work on the filters and pump houses and we pounce on any indication there may be a drop of water in the lines or tanks.""Grew up in the late 80's/early 90's in a house with a violent malignant manipulative narcissistic mother. As the eldest daughter I was made her immediate scapegoat. We lived far out in rural central Canada and were almost never allowed to watch television, not that there was much to watch with 3 channels.There were a few brief years where the extra curricular activities of my siblings were highly time consuming, sports, clubs, etc, and my father was a workaholic (very good man, but work always came first). This got them out of the house for several heavenly hours a week and off my ass.""I've been involved in hockey all my life, so a good 27 season by now. Played, coached, trainer, official, all of it from house leagues up through elite competitive to where the NHL/WHL/NCAA/National Hockey would show up to scout future players.""(8 years ago) My first week at my first unit after basic we had a briefing from a Captain who had just returned from a 6 month observation tour in Sudan (UN). He talked about how he went to many villages and regions where NGO's/charities you see advertising in North American had come in and tried to implement a quality of life improvement, such as water wells or schools... and none of it was still in effect. The wells had broken so the people went back to walking 2 miles for water and schools were torn down due to shoddy construction or where destroyed by rival tribes during conflicts. Apparently at the time in the Sudan if you didn't like some one, you killed them. Don't know if it is still the same or not. "Are you a vampire?

A lot of art from the pizza parlor in question depicts some nasty looking stuff and has some symbols in the art work. Weak evidence? Sure. Still more than nothing. Furthermore, if it *were* the case that it was a true conspiracy, it is one among the elites of Washington, and they probably have connections in the government, and the resources to really make a good cover up. The ridiculousness of the conspiracy is the partisanship to it. And the alleged Satanism involved. For sure, if there's a child sex ring, then it's got a bipartisan involvement. And aside from that weird thing that Alex Jones filmed at that rich person retreat where they were worshiping the market, I'm not under the impression that anyone's a satanist in the government, that's just ridiculous christian bullshit.

Of his death Einstein said "Haber's life was the tragedy of the German Jew - the tragedy of unrequited love." He worked on chlorine gas during WW1 because he thought it would shorten the war, the same motivation for the US's Manhattan Project. He's definitely an interesting guy, like you said a hero and a villain.

When driving my first vehicle across this country. That amazing feeling of freedom, and happiness that all Americans strive for.  was quickly yanked away under the realization that any kind of movement to retrieve information while under police inquiry in my vehicle could result in my immediate death. It's scary knowing that anyone of my 3 big black objects; My wallet, pocket sketchbook, and phone. could have me dead on the ground in an instant.    And now with the rise of this bigotry, xenophobia, and intolerance at the head of this new wave of rising fascism. with movements such as blue lives matter seeking to remove police, and goverment accountability from the public thought, and the branding of political dissent against this dangerous close mindedness as treasonous, or even terroristic.It really does make me fear not just for my future, but for the future of humanity as a whole. The last thing anyone needs right now is the greed, selfishness, and just plain inhumanity that the Fascist, and this current administration is trying to sell us. our planet literally can't afford for us to be ignorant, and xenophobic at this time!

I don't know, a live alien who has been guiding the cover-up and conspiracy, and Mulder and Scully are having this one little final moment of doubt, whether they should enter through this door and answer the final riddle of the entire series. And Scully is insistent, because now she just wants to know, but Mulder is having a little crisis of faith, like, "But what if all we find in here is just more questions without answers?" And she goes, "Whatever we find, we'll handle it together." Then she gestures at the door and says, "The truth is in there." And they go to open the door and then, boom, credits and we never find out and it doesn't matter because whatever the truth is, they finally find it and that's the end of their story.

You are in charge of their Jewish education. Their school and friends will give them their American education. Just be sure that both parts of their culture is valued. It would be even better if they interact with other mixed and biracial kids to see a diversity of families so that they know that being different is normal and nothing is wrong with them. If at any time they are feeling othered by Jewish or Korean people in your community, don’t force them to participate in that community.

699	 explainlikeimfive	 white_nerdy	 2018-01	 ['jewish', 'holocaust']	 1514775742	 I don't necessarily agree with everything that I'm going to say here.  Instead, I'm going to try to explain the mindset, so some of the things I say here will be from the point of view of a well-intentioned person who fears Syrian immigration, since this is what the OP's asking about.It's not a race thing.  It's an us-vs-them thing, which may be framed as a race/country/religion/culture thing.On Sep. 11, 2001, some Muslim Middle Easterners flew planes into prominent New York City skyscrapers and the Pentagon (national military headquarters).  In addition to the loss of thousands of lives -- the most casualties from an attack on American soil since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 -- and the enormous property damage bill, it's hard to understate how traumatic it was to the American people's psyche at the time.For most Americans, it was a blow we never saw coming.  We thought all our radars and fighter jets and stealth bombers and nuclear deterrent meant that not even the resources of multiple enemy nations combined would be able to progress to the point of destroying our buildings in armed conflict.  Even half the world united against us under the leadership of the USSR saw that writing on the wall and just Gave Up after a half-century of Cold War conflict.Then our buildings -- not just any buildings, but famous symbols of our economic and military might -- were destroyed or heavily damaged by ten or twenty guys armed with improvised knives.The hijackers didn't care about their lives; their religious leaders promised they'd get ten billion virgins in heaven.  The material reasons cited by Al-Qaeda were things that most Americans don't really know much about and don't really see as very oppressive to the other side -- of course we have bases in the Middle East, we have bases everywhere; of course we support Israel, the Jewish people are clearly the Good Guys because they went through the Holocaust.  The sheer insanity, bordering on incomprehensibility, of the whole scenario made a lot of people back up and realize that there are a lot of things we didn't understand about the world, it wasn't as secure as we thought.  So we'd better lock it down to make sure this kind of thing never happens again.  The American people willingly gave a lot more power to intelligence / surveillance apparatus, and insisted on the ridiculous, dignity-destroying, privacy-violating dog-and-pony show of security theater at airports.  In addition to practical measures to thwart this specific attack vector (reinforced cockpit doors which remain closed for the duration of flight; crew and passengers will now likely resist hijackers even if it means some of them might die in the melee).Those responsible for the attacks were definitely Bad Guys.Now, after one decade (going on two) of resulting military conflicts, continued suicide attacks by Middle Eastern Muslims around the world, and the various misdeeds of what I can only describe as a 21st century barbarian state (ISIS) which has arisen in the area.  Much of the news the American public has had of this part of the world is how Middle Eastern Muslims are committing acts of terrorism and barbarities like ISIS' beheadings, mass executions, etc.  Those responsible for these events are definitely Bad Guys.Now imagine the only thing you know about Middle Eastern Muslims is that they were responsible for the September 11 attacks, and the only things you ever hear about Middle Eastern Muslims is a drumbeat of news where the Middle Eastern Muslims are always the Bad Guys.  You might start to just accept it as a fact of life:  Middle Eastern Muslims are Bad Guys.Is it because of the race, or the religion, or the culture, or the particular country in question?  Maybe they use a lot of lead based paint in the Middle East and it affects brain development?  You don't know.  But regardless of the cause, it seems like keeping the Bad Guys far away will hopefully prevent another September 11.People whose families have been here for generations?  Who don't worship Allah, pray to Mecca five times a day, require females to wear the hijab, etc.?  They're obviously not part of the foreign country/race/religion/culture that's responsible for the above-mentioned insane bad things we hear about on the news.  So they're accepted.

728	 HunterXHunter	 Frf20	 2018-01	 ['greed', 'greed']	 1514776231	 Heavens Arena- Gon did not get significant training from just that one fight. He only used applications that he already learned. Both Zetsu was something he had already learned and acclimated to before this fight. Killua being able to watch Hisokas fight vs Kastro, was arguebly more informative. Not only that, but you atrophy in skills alot when you have to lay in bed all day.Greed Island- You were watching scenes that were exclusive in the 2014 anime. Killua lasting longer in Biskys training was not implied in the Manga. For Greed Island.For the CA arc, we don't know if both of them maintained the same output. If Gon was using a more intense aura, it would be natural for him to run out first. By the time they finish their training, both maintained their Aura for the same amount of time. (Chapter 202)As for the Dodgeball game, both learned differing technique, but I am adamant Gon learned more from the game. Particularly in developing his Hastu and summoning energy. Chimera Ants- Yes. **The Gap closed.** You seem to imply that Killua removing his needle was some magical power up. No. It is him getting his shit together and finally attacking back. Both of them had undergone much further training and fights. Both would have killed Rammot in a whim.Killuas Godspeed varies depending on what actions he performs when it is activated. If he is just running, it can last much longer. If he is fighting it will deplete very quickly. His Godspeed lasted half a minute when in combat. If Killua was actually trying to do damage, it would have lasted even less time.Killua would take moderate damage from the fight against the Bat and the Owl. Killua would not be able to tank the Owls feathers as Gon did. Killua is also not as familiar with the Biology of wildlife as Gon. Gon knew that the Bat cannot glide though the air without making noise, for example. Gon also knew how to exploit the Bats echolocation. Killua cannot launch a ranged attack, unlike Gons Paper. Meaning he would not have been able to put additional pressure on the Owl and Bat as they were retreating or swapping places. Gon can take on the entire initial splatton of ants. Gons was fighting two officers face to face. Killua never did that, neither did the Phatoum Troupe. Most of Killuas targets were grunts. Gon would simply put up a modest amount of Ken and any attacks the grunts do would be useless. He would also use emission attacks on the Dung Beetle instead of charging up his blowhole. Gon would have never gone down that cave with the Octopus in the first place. If he was hypothetically inside the cave, the first thing he would do is leave and go back to more advantageous territory, not over a pond of Piranhas.Morel never saw Gons actual rage, so you cant really compare the two with him.

Au contraire, it is perhaps the inevitable outcome of your inchoate minds (sub 140 iq, I'd wager a Drachma on it, cute) not being able to detect obvious sarcasm. Yes, I'm talking about the Rick and Morty "copypasta", you ingrates."His personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance"This is pure twaddle. And yet it managed to fool you? Have you even read La Conquête du Pain, you over-inflated mediocrity?"The humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens."This should have given it away to anyone with half a properly-firing synapse in their brain (that's a concept in neuroscience, something which I understand better than many college professors, incidentally), but clearly these Untermenschen do not fall into the aforementioned Predicament (a reference to philosophy, something I have educated myself immensely in through my consumption of Rick and Morty).What is the Noumenon here, the referent to which we are all referring? Why, it is nothing more than an impersonation of an idiot, made by an idiot, for other idiots to read and smirk amongsteth themselves, thinking themselves clever; but little do they know, that when one comes into the arena with Knowledge as their Gladius (Latin for sword, feeble-minded ones) they can cut through such foolishness like a Plumbus through margarine. Clearly, you are not wise, for if you were, you would not have risked inflaming my wrath. Clearly, you are not knowledgeable, for if you were, you would have been aware of the utter inanity of discerning any connection between "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub" and Отцы и дети, which I have read in the original Russian, naturally, which really helps one appreciate the playfulness of the masterful prose.Farewell, fools. Perhaps you should be back to your regularly scheduled brain-dead entertainment?

Then, she is still pro-MLM and thus has no credibility to me as someone who is anti-LLR.  And finally, as you say, her idea of "journalism" is to just write down whatever some "insider" tells her, even if it is libel.  It is sad to me that she is the face of the anti-LLR movement because she has no talent whatsoever when it comes to writing about this subject.  For some reason, despite have no writing skills, she thought she was the perfect person to write a blog.  You know, she is just the epitome of a person who falls for MLM scam after MLM scam: a below-average, poorly educated person who thinks she is a genius.

It's not everyone, obviously, but it's a noticeable number of people who I see doing this. And they're not shills, or at least they're no obvious indication that they're shills. I think it's harmful for the community to deny this instead of facing it head on.  EDIT: there is literally one in one of the threads on new right now.

745	 AskReddit	 papaparrotuno	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514776373	 I mean you’re right, it’s a very nuanced issue, but I just don’t see a resolution that would fairly treat the Palestinian community. Also, what would make you think that most Jewish people are pro Palestine? Most that I know are, unsurprisingly, pro Israel either explicitly or under the guise of being “pro peace”. And what do you mean Jerusalem in exchange for settlements? I think a big part of the conflict is that any negotiations that provide Palestinians with portions of land can not equal what they once had: the entire country.  And what do you mean Palestinians have Mecca and Medina?? Those are holy places of worship for all Muslims, they are not countries where entire populations reside and call home. If people were to displace Christians from a particular country, their home, would that be okay because they have parts of Jerusalem??

748	 ireland	 raspberry_smoothie	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514776400	 &gt;Are we going to decentralise power more so that regions like the North have more control over regional affairs, or are we just going to absorb NI into the existing structure?Legal system shouldn't be decentralised, northern Ireland should follow the same laws as Ireland, same voting system etc. Belfast should have a city council with reasonable powers as should Dublin and cork. There should be a northern Ireland executive that controls all the flegs and marches etc etc. but powers unionists have now should in part be transferred to the dáil, I believe that unionist parties should be allowed a veto that prompts a kind of direct democracy vote where the veto only stands if supported by a 2/3rds majority of people from a unionist background and if a stalemate persists and no solution is found through an independent commission working alongside Unionists and the rest of, a referendum on the issue involving the whole Island should be held which is the final say. I believe this to be the fairest solution, because it ensures the unionist party is actually representing the unionist community when it takes extreme measures such as a veto, and ultimately the whole island will decide on a final solution if the politicians can't come to one themselves. I realise that the unionists will be outnumbered in the final referendum but that's inevitable in any form of united ireland, no matter what the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland can have only one vote each. &gt;Currently in NI education is heavily segregated between Protestants in state schools and Catholic in Catholic schools. Are we going to integrate them? How would we integrate them?Yes, eliminate religious schools. education and religion should not be mixed. this is a problem that extends far beyond northern Ireland, we should not be forcing muslim, jewish etc etc children to attend catholic schools as things stand, eliminate faith based and private schools, adopt a model similar to finland, where there are only public schools so wealthy and influential people have the incentive to improve the schools for all children. We would integrate them by catchment area, live inside the boundaries of a school you go to that school. Catchment areas should be drawn such that there is a roughly equal number of children from unionist and nationalist backgrounds in each school catchment. This shouldn't be an immediate switch, children already enrolled should complete their schooling in schools they are already in and complete the curriculum they have been taught up until then... &gt;Will Northern schools have to adhere to Irish state curriculum? Could they adhere to the current NI curriculum if they wished?The Irish state curriculum would have to change significantly, Irish couldn't be compulsory in northern Ireland but should be offered as an optional subject for the entirety of schooling. The republic could maintain irish being compulsory but it might be best to follow the same model as northern Ireland. It's not a serious issue. No they couldn't adhere to an old antiquated curriculum past the aforementioned transition period. &gt;Would we maintain the existing PSNI in the North( I would strongly hope that we do), or are we going to absorb the PSNI into the Gardai?The PSNI would become a branch of the Gardai in a long transition period 20-50 years, where they gradually become more and more integrated into the Gardai. Initially the two organisations will opperate as somewhat independent bodies enforcing the same law, but gradually PSNI officers will be transferred to the gardai and vice versa, especially in the hierarchy. after a while a top position of the most qualified whoever that may be, be they PSNI, Gardai or from elsewhere, perhaps another european state, will be formed to head both branches, and an hierarchical structure will form from there. During this transtition period the PSNI will be given both names, after the period they will be the Gardai Siochana - Guardians of the peace (or Guards for short in english), they will obiously answer to police etc etc, but the official name will be as above. &gt;Are we going to keep the tricolour, Amhran na bhFiann? How can we make the symbols of the state more inclusive to the 'Orange' side of the country?Ditch both, tricolour may have initially represented the unionists but it only alienates them now, I would propose the presidential flag but if that isn't appropriate we'd design a new flag. Amhran na bhfiann should go too, it's clearly not appropriate for a united Ireland, with two major communities, we'd compose a new anthem. and perhaps play both in things like GAA games but only the new anthem at official state occasions. &gt;Are we going to recognise Ulster Scots as an official national or regional language? Are we going to incorporate Ulster Scots into state documents, presentations etc as we with Irish and English now?Does it meet the requirements for an active language? how many people speak ulster scots fluently? I've never come across even one. If it does we should have a direct democracy vote of unionists on whether or not they would like ulster scots to be made an official language and be brought in as a language in schools etc. perhaps offer unionists ulster scots if they don't want to do irish. If the whole Unionist community wanted ulster scots as an official language we should give it the same status as Irish end of conversation, I can't see why we wouldn't. assuming ulster scots is actually a live language, because again, I've never come across anyone fluent in it, or anyone who could speak it actually. &gt;I also think we need an indepth, completely independent economic report and forecast into the economic implications and realities of a United Ireland.Yes.

751	 visualnovels	 Senario-	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514776480	 I don't think it's so much a political vote as it is probably a decently well written, short, and free visual novel. The author doesn't seem to be that into the genre and probably didn't have much time to evaluate each title. Or money to do so.That doesn't mean I think its better than anything on that list. Hell I hate crying but I acknowledge little busters as one of the best dang visual novels out there.Chalking it up to politics in and of itself is a political statement. As if nothing that ever was praised that you don't agree with will ever stand on its own merits. I think that's just silly to say that if something doesn't go your way it must be due to some political reason rather than the more reasonable, the author is either misinformed or a different type of person.Not to mention LGBT stuff doesn't have some magical power to be better than anything naturally. If anything those things are often at a disadvantage or at the very least adverse to many people of the general populous.Even in anime just look at any conversation about whether traps are gay lol that's a shitstorm if anything. People just get so wound up about the possibility that maybe you like a character even if they are a pretty feminine guy. Plus the fact that coming of age stories are not new and there are many ways of doing it well. Conclusion imo...the author isn't too familiar with visual novels and did not have over 5 hours to evaluate each title. That is far more believable to me than some conspiracy that apparently just because it has LGBT stuff there is some organized effort to push it forward as opposed to other titles. Noticeably all the other titles which are arguably better all pay off a bit later than the short free type VN that won.

760	 Buttcoin	 UninsuredGibran	 2018-01	 ['smirking']	 1514776601	 To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand crypto-currencies. The technology is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical computer science most of the concepts will go over a typical user's head. There's also Satoshi's decentralized vision, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from cyberpunk literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these concepts, to realise that they're not just useful- they say something deep about ECONOMICS. As a consequence people who dislike Bitcoin truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the meaning of /r/bitcoin's existential catchphrase "HODL," which itself is a cryptic reference to Frank Miller's epic 300. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Andreas Antonopoulos' genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them.And yes, by the way, i DO have a Bitcoin tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

Orthodox still condemn gays (although generally not as harshly as Evangelicals).  It's been a problem in the Orthodox community though as more of them come to terms with being gay and fitting in with the Orthodox community. Conservative Judaism is kind of the middle ground between Reform and Orthodox.  They recently started supporting gay-marriage/having gay rabbis. But Leviticus is really one of the dumbest books to cling to to support anti-gay views seeing as it had nothing to do with gays and practically no one today follows Leviticus.

"Witch hunt" is another weaponized term. I suggest that when they call it a witch hunt, we should agree, because unlike in the past, we are "hunting" real, satanic witches. Our enemies employ the "boil the frog" method. I don't have time for that. I employ the "rip off the bandage" method. They may not like it, but they remember it, and if and when they wake up, they'll thank you for it. If and when it is all exposed, when the evil is seen finally in the full light of day, then the doubters will be at the forefront of the lynch mob, and we, the responsible ones, will have to hold them back so due process and justice will prevail. We are rational. They are emotional. As to what they call us, what does it matter. They already call us racists, alt right goons, Nazis, sexist, etc., hell... witch hunter is an improvement. By all means, have your facts straight (that's more than they will ever do!) but do so because you respect the TRUTH, not because of what somebody (who is no better than you are) might or might not say or think. Those are my thoughts, and I hope they help you. Thank you for your thoughtful post, and thank you for fighting evil. 	
788	 Mafia3	 Vince_Terranova	 2018-01	 ['greed']	 1514777000	 I can only speak for me, but no, I felt Vito was a better protagonist. That being said, I can understand why someone would like Lincoln more. Vito came across as being quite simple: he cared about two things: Money, and loyalty to his friends and (blood) family. He could be funny, kick back and relax, or be very serious. Fundamentally, Vito didn't change much over the course of Mafia II: who he was at the beginning wasn't far off from who he is at the end. Mostly, Mafia II is about watching Vito react to the world around him and the situations he ends up in; rather than watching the world actually change the characther. Mafia III is the opposite, with two very different Lincolns at the beginning and ends of the game. While we see the same sort of things happen to Lincoln, his adventure is a more transformative one. One can argue that Lincoln has a wider range of emotions over the course of Mafia III, from pain and agony to happy-go-lucky to plotting criminal mastermind. He's got a much wider variety of personality on show over the course of the game he stars in. At first glance, I'd agree that Lincoln is a better protagonist, but there's one thing that Lincoln is sorely lacking that Vito had in spades.And to me, that's charisma. If you go through the internet, you'll see a lot of people claiming that Mafia III might as well be a Punisher game. For all of the nuanced writing that went into Mafia III to show the many sides of Lincoln Clay, a lot of it gets lost on a lot of people because of his dominant trait: Violent. While Vito has a HUGE body count in Mafia II, there's something about him that allows Vito to still be likeable. Even when he does shady things or hurts people, you look at it and you can understand where he's coming from. Vito gets to play the big brother and beat the shit out of his sister's abusive husband. Lincoln? Well, he's out to get revenge. One can argue that revenge is a motivation you can relate to, but even in the first dialog between Lincoln and Donovan after waking up from a coma, as you're driving Donovan's car back to the burned out bar, they discuss the fact that Lincoln doesn't want to just kill Sal Marcano and get a clean and even revenge: he wants to take down his entire operation. By the end of the game, we see Lincoln being pulled towards greed, power, and ultimately being a crime boss. Depending on the ending and your choices in game, Lincoln can basically become a backstabbing asshole who knocks off his (debatably) loyal underbosses. Lincoln has a transformation in Mafia III, but it's not a positive one. Vito still maintains some level of honor and loyalty, respect towards others, and gives people honest chances even when he knows better than to trust them. When you include Vito's arc in Mafia III, I think we begin to see that Vito isn't a simple, poorly developed characther: rather, he's a man who has his morals and he follows them to a tee. Vito's simply more likable for me, and a lot of other fans. That isn't to say Lincoln isn't a great characther, but Vito feels more human. He feels vulnerable. Mafia II ends with Vito loosing everything he's worked so hard to attain. Mafia III ends with Lincoln ruling an entire city and commanding a criminal empire. Vito resonates with me.On top of this, I think Vito is also a better protagonist for the Mafia series. He combines the old world romanticism of the Italian mob (the stylish suits, the sense of loyalty to family and friends, etc) with a world-weary outlook that makes him not only a fantastic characther to play as, but one that also (at least in my opinion) deserves to get more screen time in other Mafia entries. Lincoln Clay was cool, and I enjoyed his story, but he just doesn't hold a candle to Vito. Vito reminds me of my grandfather, even though my grandfather wasn't a gangster. Lincoln reminds me of a comic book vigilante. Vito just feels more real and grounded, more human, and as such, easier to relate to. Also, Vito looks better in a suit; and I like protagonists who wear suits.

Kennedy, and other prominent figures were involved in various schemes to forward a vast global conspiracy, involving the Mafia and corrupt politicians, brutal oil and drug cartels, rogue military operations, and more. It also posits that early in 1957, Aristotle Onassis had Howard Hughes kidnapped from his Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow; that Hughes suffered a massive brain injury during the forcible kidnapping, and that Hughes was subsequently a virtual prisoner of Onassis on Skorpios and injected regularly with morphine, while Onassis took over the operation of Hughes's considerable financial affairs, including airlines and U.S. defense contracting.[1][2]The Gemstone File portrays Onassis as the main force behind the election of John F. Kennedy as President, and subsequently, Kennedy's assassination in 1963. According to the documents, Lee Harvey Oswald was a patsy in the JFK assassination plan and was linked to the Central Intelligence Agency, and to Mafia connections in New Orleans, with Jimmy Fratianno, Johnny Roselli, and Eugene Brading as the real shooters. The Gemstone papers claim that John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Joseph P. Kennedy were involved with the Mafia and Onassis, and when the Kennedy brothers attempted to break away, they were murdered.[1][2]"

808	 btc	 where-is-satoshi	 2018-01	 ['merchant']	 1514777253	 Yes. 5 reasons why Bitcoin Cash is the best option for someone looking to get into crypto.1. It is fast as it has 0-conf, the fastest over the counter trade short a customer with exact change. 0-conf is even faster than the so-called lightening network which must interact with multiple nodes to the recipient. As the [median](https://www.swiftinstitute.org/sites/default/files/upload/The%20Statistics%20of%20Payments_v15%20-%20Chapter%2010%20How%20big%20is%20that%20payment.pdf) cash spend is just $15, 0-conf hands Bitcoin Cash a speed advantage over all other cryptos.2. It always operates uncongested by design, even when it becomes the first global currency servicing [10 billion people x 50 TXs a day](http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html) your TX will still get into the next block.3. It has 10 minute block times necessary for incredible scaling on-chain. Bitcoin Cash has already proven on-chain scaling to 8MB blocks and can scale on-chain to 32MB blocks by simply relaxing a soft-limit. The Bitcoin Cash testnet has [mined](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://news.bitcoin.com/gigablock-testnet-researchers-mine-the-worlds-first-1gb-block/&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwxZCYv7DYAhWCx7wKHfD1DJUQFgglMAA&amp;usg=AOvVaw0lommjypr6e-N0LaD5-Qb7) 1 GB blocks demonstrating on-chain scaling to beyond visa levels, and this [study](http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html) examines on-chain scaling to blocks supporting 10 billion people x 50 TXs/day.4. It has gained the coveted network effect advantage with the influx of merchants which has already begun to drive merchant acceptance. You can expect Bitcoin Cash to regain the dominant position it held prior to the blockstream/core aberration. This is why, regardless of the features/capabilities of altcoins (including Bitcoin Core), Bitcoin Cash can look forward to the largest growth.5. It is supported by a community that is bound by vision and generosity rather than censorship and deceit. It enjoys the high moral ground of "a peer-to-peer electronic cash system" as described in the whitepaper. **Bitcoin Cash - on its way to becoming the first global currency.**	
809	 politics	 UWCG	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514777254	 An anonymous online blog and a porno rag are not statistics, they're laughable even as sources. As I stated in my previous comment, I'm not sure what your issue is with minorities and why you keep bringing that into this; [57% of rapes are committed by whites](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/perpetrators-sexual-violence). This last number is, once again, from RAINN, a source you originally cited. This also has nothing to do with race or racism.There are plenty of other, non-conspiratorial solutions. Like, here's one that's not a conspiracy at all, just common sense: it's hard to get a conviction for any crime and more so for crimes that are typically performed behind closed doors to avoid witnesses. This is not some attempt by women to invent rape for payouts while police cover it up because conspiracytard land.	
810	 ElderScrolls	 ErzherzogT	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514777260	 I don't normally like comparing ES races with real life culture because to some degree individual races in ES take bits and pieces from a wide range of real cultures.That being said, I appreciate that you pointed out the parallels between the dinner and Jewish religion. Besides what you said, there are clear similarities between Moses and Veloth. Most people never mention it. I suppose Judaism is too "mundane" for them.

812	 EnoughLibertarianSpam	 potpan0	 2018-01	 ['scapegoat']	 1514777296	 First I'd just like to clarify that a 'market economy' is not synonymous with 'capitalism', even though I assume that's what you are trying to say. Yugoslavia, for example, practised 'market socialism', where the economy was based around workers co-operatives. That wasn't capitalism, but it was a market economy. Now onto the main point. One of the key points Contrapoints makes in the video, and that the anti-capitalist left make generally, is that capitalism is an inherently exploitative system. It's a system of owners and workers; of those who own the means of production and those who work on it; of those who have political power and those who do not. This creates conflict in multiple ways, such as the workers having their labour exploited and doing more work than they get paid for, and workers having to compete amongst themselves in order to get employment and earn enough money to live. This leads to the sustaining of reactionary views. In order to alleviate the pressure on the owners, these groups will often attempt to scapegoat other groups and blame them for the issues under capitalism. In American history this has been most obvious with the scapegoating of black workers, female workers and Mexican workers, all of who have been blamed at some point for the suffering of the white male workers. There is a reason why, globally, the growth in reactionary tendencies has correlated with periods of capitalist stagnation and decline, most notably in the 1930s. So no, fundamentally speaking, you cannot promote both progressive social views and a capitalist economy, as a capitalist economy promotes inequality and undermines progressive social positions.

How are you going to say that they randomly made this connection when the conspiracy theory is laid out in front of you? You have to make it into a random theory rather than evaluate it on its own level so that you can refuse the possibility of such a thing. Why? Because you are clearly a biased liberal. Hence why your entire comment history essentially takes place in this Hilldog echo chamber and the other one called r/politics.

The pain and burden carries down through blood, time, politics...In the end I feel no sympathy for Rolo. He used innocent people as guinea pigs for his experiments and made profits off of black pain and black suffering, especially against an innocent black man (I don't think it was a coincidence that Charlie Brooker named the episode and the museum itself "Black Museum").I mean, of course no one deserves eternal suffering - but Rolo is now trapped in the prison he himself created and capitalised off of.

Without any evidence, logically you should side with the one that makes the most sense, aka, it's not a huge cover-up conspiracy, and its just that experts don't believe it is real.And I'm sorry, but the moment someone starts talking about 'energy lines' and Psychics for sources their credibility goes out the window.

Also, the Aramaic that was spoken here before the Arab invasion was [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Palestinian_Aramaic) particular variety.I am proposing what I believe to be a fair transaction. You're all butthurt about the supposed Judaisation of food or whatever frivolous crap you're complaining about, so I hereby give you yallah, various Arabic curses and whatever food of yours that you want back.

862	 AskHistorians	 Hergrim	 2018-01	 ['merchant']	 1514777984	 Capwell's references are fairly limited, and he seems to be planning on discussing the subject in more depth when he writes his next book.However, I did find a reference to *The Merchant of Prato* which indicates that Francesco Datini, who was established in Avignon by 1361, was sending bales of Milanese armour to Spain in 1395 and he already had quite a significant inventory of Milanese armour in 1367 (Edge and Paddcok don't give their source, but Matthew Strickland mentions Datini in connection to his mid-14th century inventory). I think that's pretty strong evidence of Milanese armour being more common in France than I'd previously assumed. Add in other elements (6000 sets of armour supplied in several days in 1427 + movement of Lombards into France), and I think there's a strong case to be made for the French at Agincourt having better armour than they've been credited with.

It also happened that they were banished to Antarctica for a while in the 20th century, and the writers confirmed that this was to avoid having the Minions help Hitler. However, by doing this, they totally confirmed that Minions would be ready and willing to become Nazis, and would have gladly ran concentration camps. And what if the massive population of Minions helped the Germans win the war? Those TicTac looking fuckers could have led to the entire world bowing to theAxis powers and to the total genocide of the Jewish people, and honestly it’s disgusting to me.

Once you have developed enough thought to somewhat answer these questions, you are prepared to face the truth about the minions and the Illuminati. Before I go over this let's briefly look at the history of both, the Illuminati and the minions. Because I do not want to type all this I will refer to this simple quotation, " The Illuminati began as a secret society under the direction of Jesuit priests. Later, a council of five men, one for each of the points on the pentagram, formed what was called “The Ancient and Illuminated Seers of Bavaria.” They were high order Luciferian Freemasons, thoroughly immersed in mysticism and Eastern mental disciplines, seeking to develop the super powers of the mind. Their alleged plan and purpose is world domination for their lord (who precisely this lord is varies widely). The Illuminati are alleged to be the primary motivational forces encouraging global governance, a one-world religious ethic, and centralized control of the world’s economic systems. Organizations such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the International Criminal Court are seen as tentacles of the Illuminati. According to the Illuminati conspiracy, the Illuminati are the driving force behind efforts to brainwash the gullible masses through thought control and manipulation of beliefs, through the press, the educational curriculum, and the political leadership of the nations." Now that we have a basic understanding of the Illuminati let's focus on the minions... "Evolving from single-celled yellow organisms at the dawn of time, Minions live to serve, but find themselves working for a continual series of unsuccessful masters, from T. Rex to Napoleon. Without a master to grovel for, the Minions fall into a deep depression. But one minion, Kevin, has a plan; accompanied by his pals Stuart and Bob, Kevin sets forth to find a new evil boss for his brethren to follow. Their search leads them to Scarlet Overkill, the world's first-ever super-villainess." Now we will connect the dots a little... Why are the minions so popular? This is because the Illuminati is the driving force behind the minions. Think for a minute, Universal Studios, a large organization, is influenced by the Illuminati. The minions only have one or two eyes are a small signal of Illuminati operation... 1+2 = 3. Three sides to a triangle, illuminati confirmed. Now you may ask what is the Illuminati proposing? The Illuminati is using lovable minions as a metaphor for making us love and respect those who work for the evil. Minions strive to serve their evil villains. What do these villains seek? *World Domination** What does the Illuminati seek? World Domination The minions are yellow and so are the bananas that they love so much. The Illuminati is implying that Yellow Eats Yellow. Yellow eating Yellow = cannibalism. They are implying that those who follow the minions must remove any threats so then the world can be then dominated by the Illuminati in the future. It is time to open your eyes and join the protest against the Illuminati. I want to inform you that this post is not from the Illuminati,telling you not to follow, so you do not think of any threats... Or is it? (No it's not)	
881	 WeddingPhotography	 presaging	 2018-01	 ['merchant']	 1514778188	 I sincerely thank you for the feedback--I have been feeling defeated about where to take it as of recently. To answer your questions, I will reply in order:1. Currently, I think my motive was to capture all interested parties in photography. Though as you stated in its current form misses the target for both beginners and experienced photographers. Moreover, there needs to be a platform built to do the hand holding like a How To or Purchasing Guides area added. And, to capture more experienced buyers I need a Browse All button so that experienced people can go straight to what they want.2. I like where you are going with the beginner guides, and I honestly might have to do interviews with Photographers to generate content for such a thing as I lack professional expertise in Photography. Beyond the point of writing a college level research article of course.3. The primary objective to boot was simply to build a price comparison engine. I have been a wantrepreneur for a long time, and decided one day to start from ground zero and learn how to code--thus either way the internal motive was to put myself into action.4. The benefit, or ultimate benefit is to have a curated area for photographers to interact with each other, and share what is working for them. Then the purchasing aspect would become secondary to the social interactions. Perhaps, then it would be important to also have some short of photo sharing aspect so that other photographers can see the quality of someone’s gear.5. What would make Rubycamera.com better than a simple retail site in its end stage would be the social interactions within the site. Then also, I have been considering providing the user star ratings for each item from every merchant. So, when you look at the item, and all the merchants that carry it you can see the average user rating from each retailer. Then displaying an average of all the star ratings in the search(purchasing) area.6. Currently all the items are sorted by a popularity score I gathered from Best Buy. So, the most frequently purchased items are displayed first. Perhaps, I should state that somewhere to eliminate that confusion, or simply sort by price initially.No problem there on the articulation piece as I fairly impressed by your response while being hung over. You’ve provided the best advice I have gotten from anywhere, and have pulled me out of my sense of defeat.

There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick &amp; Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

He hasnt proven to be a violent individual and he hasnt been convicted of any crimes. The only evidence we have is a confession told to one Jedi Knight prior to his arrest.Palpatine doesnt even admit to Anakin hes working with the Separatists. He only admits he uses the Dark Side and yes, he infers he is a Sith Lord. Its Anakin who suggests to Windu he is the one they have been looking for.

She liked to give back to the community whenever she could. I heard mayor Queen was the last to see her.&gt; &gt; There was also a district attorney by the name of Adrian Chase who was VERY chummy with mayor Queen. He was a real go getter. I was excited to see what he could bring to the table. He looked like one of those guys who would plan things out 8, 9, maybe 10 steps ahead of everyone else. Last I heard the cops were looking for him for some reason, but he has since gone missing. I suspect foul play. There may be more to this FBI investigation than meets the eye.Come on, this "Oliver body bags" conspiracy stuff is bullshit.

In July 2015, they were found guilty of offences including rape and child prostitution over a period extending from 2006 to 2012. The child protection charity Barnardo's stated that it had worked with the two girls in 2008 and referred one of them to Buckinghamshire County Council as in danger of child sex exploitation. The council did not respond adequately and, following the convictions, apologised to the two girls for its failure to protect them.*****Banbury child sex abuse ring**The Banbury child sex abuse ring was a group of seven men who committed serious sexual offences against under-aged girls in the English town of Banbury, Oxfordshire. In March 2015, they were found guilty of offences including rape and sexual activity with a child over a period extending from 2009 to 2014. Police in Banbury had drawn on the lessons of Operation Bullfinch, which targeted sexual abuse in nearby Oxford.*****Bristol child sex abuse ring**The Bristol child sex abuse ring was a group of 13 Somali men who committed sexual offences against underage teenage girls in Bristol, in southwestern England.

In 2010, after an undercover investigation by Derbyshire police, members of the ring were charged with 75 offences relating to 26 girls. Nine of the 13 accused were convicted of grooming and raping girls between 12 and 18 years old. The attacks provoked fierce discussion about race and sexual exploitation.*****Halifax child sex abuse ring**The Halifax child sex abuse ring was a group of 15 British Asian men who committed serious sexual offences against two under-aged girls in the English town of Halifax and city of Bradford, West Yorkshire. In 2016, they were found guilty of rape and other forms of sexual abuse in several separate trials at Leeds Crown Court. In total, as many as a hundred men may have been involved in abusing the main victim. Twenty-five suspects were charged by West Yorkshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service and fifteen of these were found guilty.*****Keighley child sex abuse ring**The Keighley child sex abuse ring was a group of twelve men who committed serious sexual offences against two under-aged white girls in the English town of Keighley and city of Bradford, West Yorkshire. In December 2015, they were found guilty of rape and other forms of sexual abuse by a unanimous jury verdict at Bradford Crown Court. They were sentenced in February 2016 to a total of 130 years in jail. The main victim, who had been targeted by ten of the men, was aged between 13 and 14 at the time of the attacks between 2011 and 2012.*****Newcastle sex abuse ring**The Newcastle sex abuse ring were a gang of seventeen men and a woman who sexually abused adolescent girls and young women from 2010–2014 in Newcastle upon Tyne after plying them with alcohol and drugs.

Their six underage victims were "subjected to sexual violence marked out by its sadism: sexual assaults designed to draw blood, multiple rapes, [and] physical attacks in which [they were] choked". The girls were white and all the abusers were not, leading to renewed discussion as to whether the crimes were racially motivated and whether the initial failure to investigate them was linked to the authorities' fear of being accused of racism.In March 2015, a report revealed that more than 300 children , mostly girls from the city of Oxford, could have been groomed and sexually exploited in the area.*****Peterborough sex abuse case**The Peterborough sex abuse case involved 10 men who committed sexual offences against under-aged girls, some as young as 12, in the English city of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. In a series of trials in 2014 and 2015, they were found guilty of rape, child prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation. The men were of Pakistani, Iraqi Kurdish, Czech and Slovak Roma heritage. Police had been alerted by the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases to the possibility of abuse taking place.*****Rochdale child sex abuse ring**The Rochdale child sex abuse ring involved under-age teenage girls in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England. Nine men were convicted of sex trafficking and other offences including rape, trafficking girls for sex and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a child, on 8 May 2012 and 10 more were convicted in another investigation in 2015. Forty-seven girls were identified as victims of child sexual exploitation during the police investigation. The men were British Pakistanis which led to discussion on whether the failure to investigate them was linked to the authorities' fear of being accused of racism.*****Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal**The Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal has been described as the "biggest child protection scandal in UK history". From the late 1980s until the 2010s, organised child sexual abuse continued almost unchallenged by legal authorities in the northern English town of Rotherham, South Yorkshire. It was first documented in the early 1990s, when care-home managers investigated reports that children in their care were being picked up by taxi drivers. From at least 2001, multiple reports passed names of alleged perpetrators, several from one family, to the police and Rotherham Council.*****Telford child sex abuse ring**The Telford child sex abuse ring consisted of a group of men who were grooming local children for sex between 2007 and 2009 in Telford in the English county of Shropshire. Up to 100 girls are believed to have been affected and around 200 perpetrators were suspected. According to the Home Office, as of 2015 Telford had the highest rate in the UK of sex crimes against children.In a series of trials stretching over two years and concluding in May 2013, seven men, mainly British Pakistanis, were convicted of sexual offences against four girls aged 13 to 16.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/thedavidpakmanshow/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

904	 The_Donald	 throwaway2348907987	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514778752	 Taken literally, treating all traffic the same is a bad idea anyway. It's a time vs. space tradeoff that arises often in computing. At some points it's *ideal* to have low latency, low bandwidth networking. Two cases would be voip and online gaming. You don't want delays and fractions of seconds matter, otherwise you'll end up with [this](https://i.imgur.com/OmNl5FG.gif), hence you'll favor tiny buffers. If a company can facilitate these kinds of communications by shaping traffic and creating a fast path/slow path it's actually ideal.In the case of things like video streaming, you want high bandwidth and large buffers - latency matters far less. It doesn't matter if you get a 1000 ping if you're pulling in multiple megabytes per second. Larger buffers = more latency, but people don't care if they have to wait a couple seconds for a video to start so long as it keeps streaming after it starts.So there are valid reasons to discriminate against traffic. Discrimination is not always bad - there are times when it's exactly what you want. NN advocates will say stuff like, "well of course that's not what we want", but that's actually what their principle means and one of the reasons NN is not a very well thought out idea, but more of a conspiracy theory.

They received the Weiner laptop and intentionally did nothing for a month, so that fake news about their contents could be leaked just before the election and Comey couldn't verify whether it was true or not because he wouldn't have known. In the meantime, Trump aides and Breitbart would broadcast Pizza-Gate level lies up to the election. Comey released the letter knowing it would probably be leaked but it would also preempt the FBI pro-Clinton conspiracy theory and let the world know that the FBI knew nothing about the contents of the e-mails. Then FBI-DC worked overtime and got the e-mails checked prior to election day.

If it’s not OCd, the 1300x is the better choice. Most of the parts selected were the cheapest available except for a couple.

It is completely detached from Ashkenazi Jewish history in general and specific to the mid 20th century.  Unknown thousands of Jews only survived WW2 because they hid their Jewishness as much as possible.  There are people constantly learning, even today, that their parents or grandparents were Jews but hid it and didn't even tell their children. [Madeline Albright](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/admin/stories/albright020497.htm) is one famous example.  Who knows how many will never find out. Maybe you are an American and feel comfortable talking about Judaism and being Jewish, but in persecuted places Jews are not comfortable talking about their religion at all.  And the end of WW2 did not end Polish antisemitism, in some cases it provoked it.  If Tommy was indeed a young Jew in post-war Poland, his Jewish ancestry would have likely been a source of shame, embarrassment and made him a target for bullying - something to hide. And with Jewish communities so decimated, he would have had nothing to lean back on.  The vast majority of Polish Jews who survived the war fled, and many who didn't flee tried to change who they were. You also said that there's no reason to think he would be averse to talk about the Holocaust - this again is completely false.  Again, maybe for younger generations.  [But the generations who lived through it often do not talk about their experience](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/03/nyregion/painful-to-recall-impossible-not-to-tell-holocaust-survivors-reveal-stories.html), sometimes not until they are nearing death and/or after prodding.  They were traumatic, scarring memories, not something to just kvetch about.   And this applies to pogroms, as well (which happened in post-war Poland). My Europe-fleeing ancestors all came to America before WW1, fleeing from the pogroms that were sweeping the Pale of Settlement at the time.  We have very few stories from them because they did not tell.  Also, while intermarriage wasn't particularly common at the time, it wasn't unheard of. That being said, I don't particular think he is Jewish, but your reasoning why is absolutely false and bothered me because it distorted the struggles that persecuted Jews went through, particularly in that time and place. Please learn more about our heritage before misrepresenting it. In terms of looking Jewish, I think that's one thing this theory has going for it.  Poles do not typically have dark features like Tommy does, he would probably look like a Jew to the average Pole.

933	 videos	 servohahn	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514779338	 I think he's talking about Song of the South, which featured a black actor, not an anti-black propaganda caricature. This would be more like saying that Fiddler on the Roof was anti-Semitic for its stereotypical portrayal of Jewish people. The *actual* problem that people have with the Song of the South, though I think that not many people can really articulate it, is that it portrays a jovial relationship between a plantation worker (presumably formerly enslaved sharecropper) and the plantation owners (or at least the "innocent" son of one). Other depictions of this setting utilize the same stereotypes but are not thought of as racist because the black characters are all solemn and "properly" resentful of the white ruling class or else focus on the continued danger to black people in the South during the Reconstruction. Not trying to appeal to an authority here, but this is almost exactly what the NAACP's criticism of it was:&gt;The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People recognizes in "Song of the South" remarkable artistic merit in the music and in the combination of living actors and the cartoon technique. It regrets, however, that in an effort neither to offend audiences in the north or south, the production helps to perpetuate a dangerously glorified picture of slavery. Making use of the beautiful Uncle Remus folklore, "Song of the South" unfortunately gives the impression of an idyllic master-slave relationship which is a distortion of the facts.The purpose of the movie was to give a cartoon depiction of the Uncle Remus stories. Disney had no safe way of doing this. To make the movie "unoffensive" by neglecting friendships between white and black characters would satisfy post-modernist sensibilities, but it wouldn't have that Disney "ideal" happy-world feel to it. If it were made without white characters, few people would have seen the movie. I think they resigned themselves to the possibility that they were going to make a movie that most people would enjoy and then potentially find an unpredictable way to interpret as racist 50 years later.

937	 AskReddit	 stanleegamez	 2018-01	 ['scapegoat']	 1514779428	 I'm glad that I was able to help, though I'm not completely sure what you mean by losing your friends tonight. If they are good friends they should stick by your side all the time and won't ditch you. (If I misinterpreted this, I do apologize.) I also have a friend who is somewhat harsh and straight to the point when delivering advice. For example, when I told him I was nervous about the prospect of picking roommates for University, he scoffed at me and told me to suck it up. However, another time, when I was addressing how he was treating my other friends like assholes, he felt remorse and apologized for his behavior. I feel that friends who expect you to act a certain way in order may not be the best, but that's just me anyways. If they have helped you a lot in other aspect (the guy I was mentioning helped me a lot with schoolwork) then continue being friends with them, though do watch out for their behavior. In fact, that same guy I mentioned treated one of my friends as a scapegoat, claiming that he was joking around with him, and was very harsh around him. Again, if I have the wrong assumption, I do apologize, but ever since that incident, I have been more aware of which people are actually friends, and which people are toxic.

Well the cryptocurrency demand goes somewhere if I am calling for btc to fall off a cliff. Best cyrptocurrency if you look at fundamentals. Its merchant adoption rate going up while btc is crippled and going down. Dont think there will ever be global adoption of crypto as a currency. And I say that after using btc for real use case since 2012(gambling). Its why I am 100% in omg as it will allow global blockchain adoption without there being global crypto currency adoption.

Socialist Party leaderEugene Debs spoke at the Hall during each of his presidential campaigns. Labor leaders like"Mother Jones" and "Big Bill" Haywood gave speeches there. The anarchist Emma Goldmanwas a frequent visitor, as was Luigi Galleani, leader of the Italian anarchist movement.-In [this Buzzfeed article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/ilanbenmeir/bernie-sanders-despised-democrats-in-1980s-said-a-jfk-speech?utm_term=.rqwg1Gab3#.wr1glJMLx), he states at one point:&gt;Democracy means public ownership of the major means of production, it means decentralization, it means involving people in their work. Rather than having bosses and workers it means having democratic control over the factories and shops to as great a degree as you can.According to [this politico article](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/bernie-sanders-socialist-surge-119785), Sanders said:&gt;I believe that, in the long run, major industries in this state and nation should be publicly owned and controlled by the workers themselves-In [this article](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/14-things-bernie-sanders-has-said-about-socialism-120265), Sanders is quoted as saying the following:&gt;All that socialism means to me, to be very frank with you, is democracy with a small ‘d.’ I believe in democracy, and by democracy I mean that, to as great an extent as possible, human beings have the right to control their own lives. And that means that you cannot separate the political structure from the economic structure. One has to be an idi*t to believe that the average working person who’s making $10,000 or $12,000 a year is equal in political power to somebody who is the head of a large bank or corporation. So if you believe in political democracy, if you believe in equality, you have to believe in economic democracy as well....&gt;Many people go to school, but most of them don’t challenge the basic assumptions of their teachers or of the system. And I always have. You reach a certain age when you start reading reasonably widely, and you find ideas that reflect your gut feeling about something. I think that’s usually the process. You find what you’re looking for. I had that feeling when I first read Eugene Debs, for example. If you read what Debs said about the goals of socialism, it’s no different from what I’ve been saying. That all socialism is about is democracy....&gt;What being a socialist means is that you hold out a vision of society where poverty is absolutely unnecessary, where international relations are not based on greed but on cooperation where human beings can own the means of production and work together rather than having to work as semi-slaves to other people who can hire and fire.-Furthermore, there are relevant quotes from Sander's book *Our Revolution*:&gt;What I learned playing on the streets and playgrounds of Brooklyn was not just how to become a decent ball player and athlete. I learned a profound lesson about democracy and self rule.(*Our Revolution*.  pg 11)&gt;O'Malley's [Owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers] devastating decision to rip the Dodgers out of Brooklyn in order to pursue greater profits on the West Coast was, I suspect, one of my first observations regarding the deficiencies of Capitalism. (*Our Revolution*.  pg 13)&gt;It wasn't just that racism, war, poverty, and other social evils must be opposed. It was that there was a cause and effect dynamic and an interconnectedness between all aspects of society. Things didn't just happen by accident. There was a relationship between  wealth, power, and the perpetuation of Capitalism.(*Our Revolution*.  pg 18)&gt;This type of greed, and ruthless Capitalism is not an economic model we should be embracing. We can do Better; we must do better. The economic establishment tells us that there is no alternative to this type of rapacious, cutthroat, Capitalism, that this is how the system and globalization works, and that there's no turning back. They're dead wrong.(*Our Revolution* pg 260)&gt;Employee owned enterprises boost morale, because workers share in profits, and have more control over their own work lives. The employees are not simply cogs in a machine owned by someone else...The Workers in these operations understand that when employees own their workplaces, when they work for themselves, when they are involved in the decision-making that impacts their jobs, they are no longer just punching a time clock. They become more motivated, absenteeism goes down, worker productivity goes up. (*Our Revolution* pg 261)

Just look at your comments.  You can’t even come up with anything of substance to defend your raging boner for the guy.  All you can do is parrot his talking points.  “He gets rid of regulation” “he makes jobs”.  Do you even know what kind of regulations he is getting rid of?  Have you considered that those regulations may have been there to protect against something far worse than having slightly less jobs than we would have without them in place?  Do you have any idea of the possible consequences of the dismantling of net neutrality?  Do you know how weak we look to other countries because our president adamantly fights against the advice of leading scientists like some kind of conspiracy theorist nut job  to protect a few of his corporate buddies?  This is the simplistic logic that has lead to all of the problems that you think trump can fix.  There is no room for reason in your simple world of extremes.  A policy can have an insignificant benefit and still be a steaming hunk of shit.  All you do is skim for the stuff that makes trump look good and flaunt it so that nobody notices the real effects of his actions.  This “alpha” mentality you are fighting so hard to normalize is called narcissism.  It has nothing to do with being better endowed or more able to dominate.

I know there's a lot of theories, and I'm not talking about what they claim to be doing at cern, I'm talking about what the average Joe believe everything the government says type person would say is a crazy conspiracy, until said average Joe actually looks into it and realizes there's actually a lot of proof to back these claims up. Anyways, my point is, with the way things are going, it's likely that we will get a hell of a lot more glitches.

There appears to be more evidence that Hilary is associated with the NWO and the occult than Trump.I haven't come across any evidence that supports the idea that Trump is associated with the NWO and the occult. Would like to see if anyone has some?The idea that all presidents are "controlled" by the powers that be is, imo, fairly accurate going back to Wilson in 1913 (b/c Federal Reserve Act) and every president since. Now the thought that Trump isn't apart of the NWO and the occult and is actively fighting against these evil fucks is welcomed. But is there any truth in this? Is he actually fighting against the powers that be or is he simply a puppet? The reason people eat up the idea (trump fighting the PTB) at every chance and at every single post/article/video (on reddit, 4 chan, etc) is b/c this gives people hope. It gives me hope. As much as I don't like trump. This idea that someone in a position of power is actually using that power to help the people and not to further some sinister agenda is uplifting and inspiring. It feels good to think this thought.One minor note: just because someone is a CEO of a wall street bank or a board member for xyz company doesn't automatically make them a bad person with nefarious intentions. Stop fucking making it seem like every CEO is tied to some conspiracy. There certainly are bad people with horrible intentions that got placed in a top position. But people who rise to the top of companies and hold positions of power are usually, USUALLY, the most competent people.

979	 pagan	 AshleyYakeley	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514780274	 Denis Feeney (following Paul Veyne) gives a fascinating picture of the nature of ancient Greek and Roman belief:&gt; [Veyne’s] marvellous phrase ‘balkanisation des cerveaux’ (‘brain-balkanisation’) captures the capacity of educated Greeks and Romans of the post-classical era to entertain different kinds of assent and criteria of judgement in different contexts, in ways that strike the modern observer as mutually contradictory. These people are involved in very different activities when they sacrifice outside a temple, talk to the custodian of a temple, read the aretalogy inscribed outside the temple, read the scholar Apollodorus’ book On the Gods, listen to hymns, read Homer allegorised or Homer rationalised, read an epic on Heracles, or read about Heracles the supreme commander in a history. Expressions of scepticism are always potentially part of the procedure, for the participants’ assent may be provisional, self-consciously in tension with dissent. -- *Literature and Religion at Rome*, pp14-15Here's Simon Price, trying to put across the very different nature of ancient Greek religion to those more used to Abrahamic religions:&gt; Many aspects of Xenophon’s account are surprising to those reared on Jewish or Christian religious assumptions. In place of one male god, in the *Anabasis* there is a multiplicity of gods, even unidentifiable gods. Gods are both male (Zeus, Apollo), and female (Artemis). There is no religious sphere separate from that of politics and warfare or private life; instead, religion is embedded in all aspects of life, public and private. **There are no sacred books, religious dogma or orthodoxy, but rather common practices, competing interpretations of events and actions, and the perception of sacrifice as a strategic device open to manipulation.** Generals and common soldiers, not priests, decide on religious policy. The diviners are the only usual religious professionals, and religion offered not personal salvation in the afterlife, but help here and now, escape from the Persians or personal success and prosperity. Religious festivals combined solemnity and jollity. **Practice not belief is the key, and to start from questions about faith or personal piety is to impose alien values on ancient Greece.** -- *Religions of the Ancient Greeks*, p3(I'm guessing you're imposing alien values on the ancient Norse as well.)

How you are cut down to the ground, you who laid the nations low!'In Sumeria, the full moon symbolized the creative force, seed of the creator god. When Enmerkar/Nimrod rose in power, Inanna (Venus--lust; also Apollo/Artemis, Amaru, Quetzalcoatl, Lucifer, etc) eclipsed the moon and became the chief god of the land of the watchers and later Babylon. This is symbolized by the five pointed star and crescent (disputed), representing the five risings/settings in the goddess' eight year cycle (Venus flower/pentagram). This is the symbol of both Islam and Communism. The Hebrews camped at Mt. Sinai/Herob in Midian (SA), the mountain of the moon. Elijah flees here before returning to destroy the rule of Jezebel and Baalim and Ashtoreths (Venus) worship--the later we label feminism, trans, etc. Both Moses and Elijah (with King Jehu) destroy the pagan idols and restore the worship of Yahweh to the Israelites.The Jewish calendar remains lunar and is now in the year 5778, the old new year falling in the Spring. -778 is a numerical representation of the 22 letter Hebrew A-B, arranged in 3 (unity) groups of 7 (perfect) letters and the last letter, Tav, being the third 8 (renewal/infinity). The present script is Babylonian and this letter differs in archaic Hebrew (used by the prophets) in which the Tav was written as a cross +. Jesus reads from Isaiah (61) in the Temple. Isaiah 14 is the restoration of Judah and the fall of Babylon. Isaiah's oracle parallels our present storm just after the quote here. Isaiah 14 begins: 'But the Lord will have compassion on Jacob and will again choose Israel, and will set them in their own land; and aliens will join them and attach themselves to the house of Jacob. And the nations will take them and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will possess the nations as male and female slaves in the Lord’s land; they will take captive those who were their captors, and rule over those who oppressed them. ...' https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+14&amp;version=NRSV

"His anointed one") (Isaiah 45:1),[15] and is the only non-Jew figure in the Bible to be called so.[16]&gt;Cyrus the Great is also well recognized for his achievements in human rights, politics, and military strategy, as well as his influence on both Eastern and Western civilizations. Having originated from Persis, roughly corresponding to the modern Iranian province of Fars, Cyrus has played a crucial role in defining the national identity of modern Iran.[17][18][19] Cyrus and, indeed, the Achaemenid influence in the ancient world also extended as far as Athens, where many Athenians adopted aspects of the Achaemenid Persian culture as their own, in a reciprocal cultural exchange.[20]

THE DAUGHTERS A WHORE,  THE SON IS CLUELESS. THE WIFE HEN PECKS THE DAD, AND HATES HIM. THIS IS THIER OPINION OF THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS. #IN THE NEAR FUTURE, AS WHITES FALL TO MINORITY STATUS, I WONDER IF THEY WILL BEGIN TO ACT AS A MINORITY. IF SO, THERE WILL PROBABLY BE A CULTURAL REASSESSMENT OF THESE  90'S-00' SITCOMS AND A CHANGE IN PERCEPTION AND QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT PEOPLE, WHO WAS SAYING IT, AND WHY.#THIS STUFF WILL LOOK LIKE HATE PROPAGANDA, LOOKIMG BACK. IF AMERICA GOES UNDER HARD TIMES OR SOME DYSTOPIAN DISASTER HAPPENS AND WHITES GET THE TREATMENT THEY ARE GETTING IN SOUTH AFRICA (SLOW MOTION GENOCIDE, CONFISCATION, BUTCHERY, RAPE ETC.) WILL THESE SHOWS BE SEEN AS LAYING THE GROUNDWORK BY  DEHUMANIZATION? #LOOK HOW CHRISTIANS ARE PRESENTED ON TV. LOOK AT FLANDERS, THE PRIEST OR PASTOR GUY AND THE CHURCH IN GENERAL ON THE SIMPSONS. THEY ARE PORTRAYED AS RUBES, CROOKS, FALSE ETC. OVER THE YEARS THERE'S SOME LOVE SHOWN TO THESE CHARACTERS, AS SAY FLANDERS IS OCCASIONALLY PRESENTED IN A SYMPATHETIC WAY,  BUT ON THE FACE OF IT, WE ARE CLEARLY INTENDED TO LOOK DOWN ON THEM AND SEE THEM AS FOOLS TO BE MOCKED. THESE SHOWS ARE VERY OFTEN DIRECTED/PRODUCED/WRITTEN BY A DISTINCTLY NOT-CHRISTIAN GROUP OF PEOPLE. THIER BIGOTRY SHOWS AND THIER VIEW IS DISSEMINATED AND ABSORBED WITHOUT QUESTION. #LOOK AT MOVIES LIKE AMERICAN BEAUTY, STARRING A GUY WE BEST NOT MENTION. HOW IS THE ORDINARY AMERICAN FAMILY PORTRAYED? HOW ABOUT THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM, LIKE THE MILITARY MAN NEIGHBOR? THE WHITE PICKET FENCE, TWO CARS, REAL ESTATE JOB, KIDS, THE LIFE EVERYONE I KNOW DREAMS TO ACHIEVE, IS PRESENTED BY HOLLYWOOD AS A NIGHTMARE, A LIE, A TOTALLY EMPTY FRUAD. QUIT YOUR JOB, DO DRUGS, ABANDON YOUR WIFE, BANG AN UNDERAGE GIRL, LIVE FOR NOW! YAY! #THE RETIRED MILITARY MAN NEXT DOOR, A VERY TRADITIONAL MAN YOU WOULD EXPECT TO RESPECT,  HAS A WIFE THAT'S LIKE A SAD ABUSE VICTIM, HE'S VIOLENT TO HIS SON, CONTROLLING, A HOMOPHOBE (BUT REALLY GAY, OF COURSE!) A MURDERER, AND SURE ENOUGH, IF THE HAMMER YOUR BEING HIT WITH REALLY JUST ISN'T GETTING THE MESSAGE ACROSS, THEY PUT IT IN NEON LIGHTS SO EVEN THE SLOWEST CAN PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER AND GET IT-  HE PRIZES HIS COLLECTION,.....OF NAZI MEMORABILLIA (LET'S ALL RAISE AN EYEBROW AT HIM, TOGETHER.) *#IS MARRIED WITH CHILDREN THE JUDD SUSS OF OUR TIMES, HATE PROPAGANDA, PRECURSOR TO GENOCIDE, AND NO ONE CAN SEE IT?#* REMINDS ME OF FALLEN DOWN. GREAT MOVIE WITH MICHAEL DOUGLAS, AHEM, NICE JEWISH GUY, BUT PLAYING AN ORDINARY MIDDLE AGED  WHITE GUY IN THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY, WHO RESPONDS TO LOSING HIS JOB AND PLACE IN A CHANGING COUNTRY, SPEAKING TO AND FOR THE ANXIETIES, FEARS AND LOSSES OF THE ORDINARY MIDDLE AGED WHITE GUY, LOSES HIS SHIT AND GOES BONKERS. THE MOVIE MAY HAVE BEEN TOO GOOD, AND SAID TOO MUCH, WITH TOO MUCH ARTICULATION. THEY HAD TO INSERT A NEW SCENE, WITH DOUGLAS (NAMED "D-FENS" TO STAND IN FOR US ALL) RUNNING INTO A REAL LIFE COLD BLOODED NAZI ANTI SEMITE. THE MOVIE MAKES SURE HE'S PRESENTED AS A HOMOSEXUAL, ASSHOLE OF THE FIRST ORDER, VIOLENT, DUMB AND EVIL. THEY MUST HAVE FILMED IT AND SAID "WHEW, THERE. DONE. WE'VE MADE SURE THE AUDIENCE GETS THE POINT AND.STAYS MARCHING IN TBE RIGHT DIRECTION." THE MOVIE THEN CONTINUES IN SPEAKING FOR ANGRY WHITE MALES, WHICH IS FINE AND COOL, AS LONG AS THE FINAL DESTINATION IS NOWHERE USEFUL. IN THE END (SPOILER!) D-FENS DOES THE THING HOLLYWOOD REALLY WANTS YOU TO PICK UP ON AND ABSORB.  HE REALIZES HE IS LEFT BEHIND AND THE WORLD IS NO LONGER HIS. HE IS UNWANTED AND IN THE PAST. HIS FAMILY BEST MOVE ON WITHOUT HIM. HE MAKES HIS MOVE AT THE END OF THE MOVIE, AND TRANSMITS THE CORE MESSAGE TO THE WHITE GUYS IN THE AUDIENCE WHO ARE ALL IN WITH THE GUY THAT HAD ENOUGH, CONFRONTED THE CRIMINAL CHOLOS, CORPORATE MCDONALD'S, THE COPS, ETC. SO HE COULD PROVIDE FOR HIS KID AND FAMILY. HE MAKES SURE HE DIES. THAT WAS THE MESSAGE. #WHITEY. KILL YOURSELF ALREADY.

Sure, technically speaking it is a "vulnerability" but what are the chances of hacking every possible point of entry and succeeding in that attack? This supposed attack starts with a man in the middle attack on a merchant to filter out double spends, then also attacks the peer nodes at the same time, while also controlling all the representative nodes voting power. Sounds like the attack would have to take over the entire internet. I dont think any technology can provide protection for you if your computer or internet connection is hacked. If you are receiving bitcoins from someone, but your computer has a trojan and your private keys are compromised, does bitcoin offer any protection for this? Or if you are visiting Gmail but get caught by a phishing site, should Gmail be responsible for this? Pretty far fetched and unreasonable 	
1015	 conspiracy	 Drooperdoo	 2018-01	 ['jewish', 'holocaust', 'jewish', 'holocaust', 'holocaust', 'jewish', 'jewish', 'holocaust', 'jewish', 'holocaust', 'holocaust', 'jewish', 'jewish', 'holocaust']	 1514781111	 Without making any overarching value judgments (or pronouncements) on the whole narrative, I *will* add this: I've noticed that the "Today I Learned" subreddit routinely has posters upload stories such as this one from today: "TIL a Portuguese Consulate Official in 1940 Disobeyed Orders to Refuse Visas to Jewish Refugees Fleeing the Nazis. He Worked for Three Days and Nights, Issuing Visas Nonstop, Saving Over 1,500 People Before Collapsing from Exhaustion. He Was Later Fired for Insubordination". Like clockwork, there's a new one every week or so. The thing is: If you add up all these stories, it's hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of Jews "who were spared" from the Holocaust. The thing is: Europe had a finite number of Jews. Germany at its height only had 500,000. Yet week in and week out, we're treated to another instance of a "righteous Gentile who saved thousands of Jews". Add them all up and an echo of Norm Finklestein's mother stirs the air: "With all these 'survivors,' who did Hitler kill?"Here are some examples: "TIL that during WWII, a Polish Catholic social worker named Irena Sendlerowa saved 2,500 Jewish children from death.""TIL that during the Holocaust, Polish doctors Eugene Lazowski and Stanisław Matulewicz saved 8,000 Jews by creating a fake Typhus epidemic. The Germans quarantined the area instead of risking outbreaks by sending them to concentration camps.""TIL Oskar Schindler, who saved over 1100 Jews in WWII by employing them, spent all his fortune on bribes and black market purchases for his workers. After the war he never regained any of his wealth and in later life had to live off of a small pension from the German government.""TIL Helena Bonham Carter's maternal grandfather saved thousands of Jews from the Holocaust during World War II""TIL that Count Bernadotte, the famous Swedish diplomat who saved tens of thousands of Jews from concentration camps during WW2, was murdered in 1948 by militant Zionists (approved by a future Prime Minister) while serving as UN peace mediator in the Holy Land.""TIL that the Danes saved almost all Danish Jews during WW2""TIL about Swiss diplomat Carl Lutz, who at risk of his life, saved over 60,000 Jews during WWII in Budapest by issuing them safe papers and harboring them in embassy buildings"(I've seen no less than 22 of these stories . . . and there are many, many more. As someone who wants to believe the official narrative--who was *raised* to believe the official narrative--I'm terrified of what will happen if I add up all the "saved Jews" that each story purports to educate the reader about.)* Footnote: Another troubling wrinkle in the official narrative is that, just as Europe's Jewish population was dwindling, millions of Jews were emigrating to New York City, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, etc. At the very time-period that we're told "Jews mysteriously vanished" from Europe, the "mystery" doesn't seem so mysterious when you look at the swelling Jewish communities in these places during the 1920s-40s. New York itself saw a two million-person increase. The thing about the holocaust totals is that they're not based on actual bodies. (Hitler incinerated them, remember?) What they actually do is visit villages in Poland, Germany, Hungary, etc., and compare lists of Jews who lived there before the war and Jews who didn't live there afterward. They just presume that if they weren't there after, Hitler killed them--without ever checking the names against lists of Jews who emigrated to New York, Sydney, Buenos Aires, etc. What makes it even more troubling is that when the Soviet archives were opened, it was discovered that Stalin transported the lions-share of Poland's Jewish population eastward into the USSR. Yet he allowed those names to be added to Holocaust death lists (knowing that those people were alive and well). See an article on it here: http://www.ibtimes.com/how-joseph-stalin-inadvertently-saved-some-polands-jews-1099571 So once again, let's start a tally of all these wonderful stories of "saved Jews" and compare them against the claims made by the official Holocaust narrative (all the while keeping in the background the fact that Europe had a small and finite number of Jews to begin with). . . . As for me, personally, certain things seemed to run counter to common sense. Like on Wikipedia's page on Ashkenazic Jews, it says, "It is estimated that in the 11th century Ashkenazi Jews composed only three percent of the world's total Jewish population, while at their peak [in the early 20th Century] they accounted for 92 percent of the world's Jews." So wait! European Jews started out as 3% of the world's Jewish total, and just as Europe was turning on them (and trying to erase them from the Earth), their numbers bloated up to 92% of the world's total?" I mean, how does that work--using mathematics? You use genocide to subtract them and their numbers get vastly LARGER? (I don't mean to sound disrespectful, but it really does remind me of Norm Finklestein (the author of "The Holocaust Industry"), whose mother was actually in a concentration camp and complained of all the people claiming to be survivors: "With all these 'survivors,' who did Hitler kill?")

1018	 AskReddit	 justlookingaround254	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514781213	 I would like to share. I grew up with divorced parents who gave their all to support me ( an only child), and my dreams. I had shopping trips on my birthday, and loving parents. I was a shit kid though. I didnt appreciate anything my parents worked their asses off for. So i got pregnant at 15... and realized what it is to live without the basics. No toilet paper? Wear a sweatshirt into the local cefco and smuggle out an econmy size roll. Shoplift baby clothes... just an absolute idiot. I got arrested for shoplifting when my son was 2. I got out, got a job, and worked my way into a wonderful lawfirm... with a GED and an 8th grade education. My kids receive medicaide ( i am rightfully uninusured), i managed to purchase a home... but I've learned a lot. In my small town the majority of the stop and goes are owned by folks from Nepal. They pass out all their deli food at midnight to those who truly need it. They also pay them to sweep the parking lots. What i learned from being spoiled, to simply being semi average, is that there are people who haven't had my best of days and give to anyone who is in need. I've never needed food from these folks, but i think it says a hell of a lot about people in general. Black, white, brown, muslim, jewish, christian... act like a human.

You made a broad sweeping comment about immigration and now you’re attempting to narrow it down to just American immigration and just at this point in time. America was built on bulk European immigration. All the cultures were euro-Christian. This is what you would call complementing cultures. Before that euro-Christian was a minority culture migrating into a dominant native culture. That didn’t go well for themIn other parts of the world, Africa for instance, the importation of a contradictory culture, euro-Christian into africa hasn’t faired well at all. The cape colonies, southern rhodesia, Portuguese East Africa, just off the cuff. The entire continents history pivots on cultural clashes. In the Middle East, the post war immigration of the Jewish culture back into Palestine/Israel. In Europe the expansion of Islam into Spain. And right now the rohinga expulsions from Myanmar. I can go on and on. If you want sources of contradictory cultures causing social upheaval and unrest. My source is the entirety of Wikipedia/human history.

Abstracts can be a ton of fun and those three are a great time.**Splendor*** Accessible tabloe builder. You are a merchant buying and selling gems. Become the best merchant you can be. It's simple, fun, and has depth.**Co-op game*** Theme matters a bit here. So does difficulty. The Captain is Dead is a great co-op if you want a sliding scale of difficulty and a space theme. Dead of Winter is a great co-op with a zombie theme. The Grizzled is fun but it can be a bear (and luck based). It does have a cool WW1 theme though. Hanabi is a great theme too. Fire works and such. Feels like a co-op. I guess it is? Pandemic will get brought up in this category. If you're playing with all new people, this will be fun. If you're playing with older gamers, they might be sick of pandemic (and there are so many versions to choose from).**king of tokyo*** It's a great dice game and an excellent light game.

Everyone I have played this with has enjoyed it.**Lords of Waterdeep*** This is a solid worker placement game. You really can't go wrong. The only other worker placement game I would recommend is Champions of Midgard. **Small World*** Truth be told, I hate this game. But I am the only person I know who dislikes the game. Mix and match all different lores, use that mix to control enough of an area to score points. **For Sale*** What Monopoly distilled is. And it is fun. Auction mechanics. Bid on a property. Resell the property for a higher value.**Resource management game*** Most people think of Catan when this is brought up. I would like to suggest Abyss. I never really liked Catan and my friends always loved it. So I was over joyed when my friends loved Abyss. You are trying to win enough votes to become king of the depths. You get votes of various water people ( the resource cards). Then you use the votes to buy senators (points cards with special abilities). The senators help you secure sections of the depths (give you more points). It's simple to learn. It's fun. And there is always a counter strategy. Only caveat. I would not play this at 2 players. It's too easy to get ahead and stay ahead.

Real Nazis don't exist anymore, all that exist now are wannabe Nazis who are such a small minority its laughable.

1043	 fantasywriters	 eabove	 2018-01	 ['greed']	 1514781733	 Hi, I left a few comments that I hope are helpful. I enjoyed reading this story, and I'd like to know more about this world (if that is the intent, well done). I like your terse writing style, it helps to develop the drama and is very powerful for setting the scene and the character.Critiques: I noticed a slight tendency for your tense to wander (past to present), which can be corrected easily. More difficult to address is your slight tendency to use gerunds (words that end with -ing and are the subject of the sentence) - these can weaken a sentence. I've tried to highlight a few of these.Structurally, I like the way that the story moves along, with the exception of a few paragraphs in the middle where things seem to slow a bit (see comments).In terms of character; Myron seems pretty badass, which I admit makes me want to learn more about the world - if he's a mage in training, what are the masters like? What is the magic system like that limits Myron's spellcasting ability? And what are the Realm Gates all about? However, I would caution that he does seem a bit of a blank slate. Is there a memory you could give him, something that will illuminate him beyond 'badass Neophyte'? His actions make him seem motivated by greed and/or a need to please his master. This could be enhanced in your description of his thoughts.I appreciate that you don't load the story down with an infodump, but a little bit more about the Realm Gates would be a very interesting way to introduce the world a bit more.Overall, some improvements can make this a much stronger story, but as a 'first chapter' prototype it has promise. Great job, keep working at it!	
1044	 malefashionadvice	 usfunca	 2018-01	 ['merchant']	 1514781736	 No, but I do some research on $200 purchases then try to buy from places with good return policies so if I don't like them I can return them.  And if I get screwed by the merchant I can always fall back on on my credit card if ultimately necessary (which I've never actually had to do).Besides, I was mostly referring to this part of his comment: "When buying ***any kind of product*** there should be a great amount of research done..." and not just the $200 purchases.

1046	 Bitcoin	 andy378	 2018-01	 ['merchant', 'merchant']	 1514781784	 That's more than likely why the shop has a limit on how much you can spend via BTC. It's their risk tolerance. Segwit or LN don't really change how this works at the end of the day, they just provide a path to this being a lower risk transaction for the seller. When you purchase with a credit card the payment is not guaranteed for the merchant. In a few days, the payment will settle and the merchant will receive their funds in the overwhelming majority of cases. A bitcoin transaction if effectively settled after a few confirmations and your full node client can validate it's a legitimate transaction almost instantly. Fees are dynamic not fixed, we are coming off a fairly major spike in fees caused by spam efforts to temporarily raise the fees. Now that the spike is over things are coming back to normal. The mempool will clear and &lt;100 stat fees will be common again until they aren't. This is fairly common in BTC these days.

1065	 AskReddit	 AntiauthoritarianGuy	 2018-01	 ['greed']	 1514782236	 No other options.For years I sold drugs and did burglaries to live day to day, and despite only taking from drug dealers, it’s not something I’m proud of to say the least. When I was in that situation I did horrible things, the kind of shit that makes you lay awake every single night. Things that I’ll never forgive myself for as long as I live. But that’s the only options I had at the time. When your only choices are: steal in order to eat tonight, or don’t steal and go hungry, the choice is pretty clear.That said, I also did a lot of unnecessary shit that I only did out of greed and lack of self control. Despite being poor and understanding how it felt to have nothing; I still took things from people everyday.Eventually though, to answer your question, I did enough bad shit long enough that I managed to save enough money to get myself a place to live and then a vehicle. At that point I got a job at Mcdonald’s, then moved up to a movie theatre manager and started slowly weening out the illegal and immoral shit from my life. Then I went onto be an administrative assistant, and now here I am. Basically, I had absolutely nothing and worked my ass off to climb to where I am today, despite all the bad shit I did that I regret every day of my life, because it was still how I lived day-to-day and I’m at least honest about it.It was a terrible road and while I’m glad that stuff is a few years in my past, there’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think about all of the awful shit I’ve done to people who didn’t deserve it. Like I said before, I thank whatever god that’s listening every single day that I’m not in that situation anymore. I thank him that I get to go to work for 9hrs/day and pay bills because this life is an absolute dream compared to the life I used to live.Sorry to preach, I get a bit emotional thinking about that shit. I don’t want to victimize myself though, there’s plenty of people on earth who’ve had it worse than me, growing up in a 3rd world country for example....

1068	 politics	 ChromaticDragon	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514782290	 Just ask yourself why that would matter.Why does corruption matter at all?A lot of the answer to that has to do with the context of the individual, their position and what is different between the way things "should" be and the current corruption.What would it even mean that Mueller was corrupt?  Taking bribes?  Bias and prejudice?  What would he be doing other than what he should be doing?Mueller is acting as investigator and prosecutor.  Are we worried he would just bury things and not pursue certain leads in order to protect folk?  Or are we worried he would be overzealous and pursue everything?  I don't the former makes any sense given the way the Republicans are disparaging him.  And I don't care about the latter.  We **need** these things investigated.  Judges, juries and the House and Senate can determine later what to do about whatever case Mueller eventually brings forward.I think the "how we would know" would depend upon the rank and file of the FBI and all the other professionals he's surrounding himself with.  That team simply reeks of professionalism and expertise.  Furthermore, they all would know how to out each other and would gain no small amount of fame doing just that.  Imaging that large a group is coordinating in some strange corrupt conspiracy seems silly.	
1069	 videos	 stuckinmiddleschool	 2018-01	 ['cowardice']	 1514782302	 Hmm...&gt;What I dislike about Transformers is the contrast in which feminine and masculine traits are portrayed. Femininity is usually portrayed as emotionally and intellectually out-of-touch, defined almost entirely by negative characteristics like cowardice and hypersensitivity. Masculinity takes center stage and never seems to have any negative qualities - and when a typically masculine character begins to act more feminine, it's only so that it can be used as a source of conflict. Resolution is often found in lessening feminine traits and accentuating masculine ones. &gt;&gt;Furthermore, "robots", which are inherently sexless, insist on identifying solely as men, no matter what traditionally feminine behaviors they may possess. In this way, the masculine characters get to appropriate the positive aspects of femininity while leaving the negative ones to the feminine female characters, in some fashion attempting to marginalize and feminity.&gt;&gt;It's a pro-machismo show that, at best, hesitates to portray feminity in a positive light unless it can also promote masculinity in doing so.Yep, I'd believe it on a cursory read.

1072	 buildapcforme	 brando_1771	 2018-01	 ['merchant']	 1514782401	 Alright I finished up this build. I think you’ll be very pleased, I don’t see anyway you’d be disappointed with this build. Let me walk you through it. For cpu, I’ve chosen an Intel i5-8400. Their budget 6core chip. This chip, is one of the best gaming chips out there for the price. It’s base clock speed is a little low, but it turbos to 3.8ghz which is plenty fast for gaming. This is really the best gaming chip in your price range, as the Ryzen 6 core 1600 isn’t as good for gaming as this is. For the board, I had a hard time deciding. Since you won’t be overclocking, I didn’t want to overspend on a board that has overclocking features you weren’t going to need. However, I still didn’t want to cheap out because there are useful features that aren’t always found on the cheapest boards. Like an m.2 slot, a halfway decent soundcard, Intel gigabit lan card. One thing to note, the retailer the list automatically selected is Vuugo, but at Newegg.ca its cheaper, as the rebate comes off of like $135 bringing the price down to $105, compared to Vuugo who’s selling it for $130 after rebate. For the ram, this was harder. I went with Corsair Vengeance LPX, 8gb in a 1x8gb layout, 2666mhz and a CAS Latency of 15. This ram is pretty quick, for the price, probably the fastest. DDR4 prices are ridiculous right now, so 8gb is really the only option. Hopefully when prices go down, you can add another 8gb for much less than what this costs now. Storage drives, I chose a standard WD 1tb Blue HDD. Pretty simple, solid choice. Usually the one everyone goes with. I didn’t add an ssd because there wasn’t room in the budget, but I highly recommend you splurge and get one. Even if it’s a cheap one. There’s a 120gb crucial BX300 I was looking at, it’s probably your best bet as it’s about $60. But if you shop around for sales you might be able to find one cheaper. I can’t recommend getting an ssd enough, it makes a serious difference when used as a boot drive and holds the OS plus your most frequently used applications. Easily the best money you’ll spend on a computer part. Okay almost done I promise. The exciting part, the video card. This was a little tricky, because we were kind in between two cards with how much budget we had left. I ended up going with an Evga 1060 6gb. It’s a pretty standard 1060 6gb, as that’s all the budget would allow, but there’s support for a boat load of monitors, it doesn’t have the best cooling, but if you’re not overclocking it, that shouldn’t matter too much. The 1060 6gb is really one of the best cards for 1080p gaming. 6gb of VRAM is really a great amount as most games won’t exceed that much. And 3gb just isn’t ideal anymore. Okay now for the case. I’ve chosen an NZXT S340. I really wanted to go with an S340 Elite, but didn’t want to go too far over budget so I stuck with the normal version. These cases are great, one of the nicest build quality in this price range. USB 3.0 in the front. The cooling is okay, but will be plenty for a non overclocked chip, with a TDP of only 65w. Great cable management. Mostly Metal which is good because many cases in this price range is riddled with plastics. Comes with 2 fans also. Lastly the power supply, and I apologize for the length of this, but i wanted to explain everything so you understand why I chose what I chose rather than just give you a list of parts. I’ve chosen a pretty basic psu. A build like this doesn’t need a high end one, and nothing is very power hungry so we could get by with a pretty low wattage. It’s a Corsair CX450M. 450w, Semi-modular so there’s cable management options, bronze rated efficiency which isn’t the greatest but pretty minimal difference between the Gold rated. Solid warranty, and build quality. Overall just a solid psu for the money. Okay that’s it I’ve covered it all. Let me know if you’ve got questions or would like something changed.

1073	 CrusaderKings	 CharlesTheDickens	 2018-01	 ['merchant']	 1514782410	 I once did an Iceland merchant republic run doing a Charlie start for the challenge and here are some tips.  Immediately take over iceland(when you can get some extra event troops) the prestige bonus, tech research, and availability of laws makes it worth it.  To avoid prestige hit of not being at war, just find some random war in Scandinavia and offer to join, it doesn’t matter if you win or lose, it’s just a good way to avoid that prestige loss.  You want to do the business focus immediately so you can get money to create the duchy of Iceland, upgrade market villages, and more importantly, use that money for scholarship focus so you can boost your military tech and get early ships.  I know that it’s premature, but your are weak in Iceland and everyone else is growing around you so using those ships early to eat all possible Norwegian neighbors is worth it.

Coming back to this I would also like at this point to point out your raging hypocrisy, you said as a child you learn that just because you want something to be true doesn't make it so, yet you then say just because there is no evidence that her Massive ciminalty exists doesn't mean it doesn't exist. I'm not claiming she is innocent, I claimed that democrats aren't clamoring for an end to the investigations. You keep claiming a massive criminal conspiracy.  Well. To paraphrase you, just because you want something to be true does not make it true. All this does is make you look like a flat earther. Saying blah blah blah we cant show you any proof but we know its true so we win.Well, sorry to be the one to point this out to you. Your clearly irrational hatred for Clinton has fueled your delusional hypocrisy.

Their normal BBQ experience is Famous Dave’s or Chilies so it was easy to blow their minds! Started the Two 15-16lb Briskets ( only salt and pepper) at 9pm on the 23rd (They do Christmas Eve dinner) on my 22.5 WSM with hickory. They hit 195 by 11am on the 24th. As quickly as I could, restoked the fire with a fresh bag of charcoal and Apple and cherry and pecan for 9 racks of loin back ribs. Earlier that morning I rubbed down the ribs with a rub I found online. 6.5 hours later @ 250ish the bones were pulling out!1 tablespoon cumin1 tablespoon paprika1 tablespoon granulated garlic1 tablespoon granulated onion1 tablespoon chili powder1 tablespoon brown sugar2 tablespoons kosher salt1 teaspoon cayenne pepper1 teaspoon black pepper1 teaspoon white pepper I pulled everything off the smoker and drove to the in laws ( 2 miles away) threw the briskets in the oven @ 300 to warm them up again. I fired up their gas grill and began brushing on BBQ sauce on 4 of the racks and caramelizing the sauce for nice crisp barkish. The briskets where super tender and juicy (Costco USDA Prime) The ribs were freaking destroyed, I think I offended / Bruised ego a few of my brother in laws as every one was saying this was the Best BBQ they had ever had.

1090	 battlefield_one	 A_Great_Forest	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514782827	 Purely anecdotal, but I recently came back to BF1 after a horrible Overwatch addiction, which I have overcome with great support from this community, and I want to say that the majority of my deaths now are at the hands of the Antoine Fuqua rifle. I think you're on to some great points, because from my end of the exchange, the Fatwah is super effective. At close range, it seems to always drop me with a few shots before I can unload back even with an M97 trench. I think there is a conspiracy by Futanari rifle deniers to portray it as a normal rifle, but in my opinion, it is overpowered.

1092	 unpopularopinion	 [deleted]	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514782914	 Well, do you disapprove of homosexuality? You can if you want, I just feel like you wouldn't feel the need to make this post if you did. The reason a lot of people don't like using the word that way is the same reason why when I borrow something from a friend I don't say that I'm "niggering your shit". By using slurs as synonyms for "bad", you equate those slurs with the concept of something being not right. Unless you're a religious fundamentalist or extremists nosy about other people's lives, it's very stupid to care that much about aspect of other people that you can't change that don't affect you. I still use gay that way though and I wouldn't try to tell you that you aren't allowed to, I just wanted to give more context as to why people don't like it. It's not just some triggered snowflake thing. If you don't see a problem with calling things that are bad gay but you do see a problem with calling bad things Jewish, untrustworthy things black and incompetent things female, then you're a hypocrite. But again, I think people still get overly offended at usage of words. Still, there are reasons that are justified to them.

1095	 news	 wwwwho	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514782998	 Thanks for taking the time for an honest and lengthy reply. Some of the things just seem arbitrary to me. We tend to dance around one of the main issues. Germany's past and Israel's influence. I could be entirely wrong, but from what I understand there is often a double standard applied to WWII, Israel, and the Jewish population.	
1096	 walmart	 workdork2017	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514783009	 Why start pointing fingers at sides of politics or otherwise to make a case?  It has no bearing on this.Honestly, this is just baiting for argument to argue and nothing more.   And it's not "WELP" its "WELL".  "WELP" is what a dog does when it has puppies.  Sounds to me like you're calling out too much and WM doesn't recognize anyones religion or practices on a regular basis regardless of what you claim to believe or not.  No  one is due any exception to that be it christian, agnostic, jewish, hindu, buddhist or flying spaghetti monster the truth is WM does not care.  The closed on Christmas situation is because it is a widespread holiday and a lot of other religious practices have holidays around the same time  that correspond on a calendar by coincidence not because WM is recognizing a holiday in favor of one over the other.  Most businesses are closed on Christmas day.

1098	 politics	 GonzoNation	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514783144	 &gt; Again I would trace many of these issues back to a problem of numbers. Japan and Germany have much less people and they are not incredibly diverse.  A repeat of an argument that didn't work the first time. In 1947 we were faced with bipolar world of the United States and Russia.  Both countries are large and diverse.  I don't see why that is ignored.&gt;One last note on academia. They are often guilty of liberal groupthink and indoctrination. Another "even if" argument that arises around age 7 through 9.  "I didn't take my sisters watch and EVEN IF I did."In this case, "I didn't cause depletion of US higher education AND EVEN IF I DID.."Sorry. It just doesn't work.   The richest person and the land are one. If the richest person makes the land impoverished then they become impoverished.  The "even if" argument is something that we as parents must explain to our children does not apply and does not really work. It's essentially saying "the reason for argument 1 isn't good enough" and undermines what argument 1 was - in this case - that there the US is destined to fail because its too big or too diverse which we know is exactly not true.&gt;The liberals used to be party of the hippies, There is a reason  why counter-culture sprang up. Some Ryan Republicans actually "gorge" themselves on that reason when it suits them.    The argument contains Skull and Bones, and the Bilderbergs, the deep state ...those are the "dream" aspects of it.  The real issue usually unspoken has little to do with Geranimo's skull: we built a nuclear bomb.And we used it.Because we did, we have to have conspiracy theories to "block out" the horror.    So the Republicans have Snowdenwald and the Democrats have (or had because its like 50 years ago) Phil Ochs.I mean if we're going to clamp off and prevent our own success today because of Peter Paul and Mary, that's pretty lame. I don't think they're all even alive anymore are they?&gt;If the democrats had all 3 branches of government, academia, the news media, and hollywood at their disposal it would be far to much power in my opinion. So America must be relegated to a 3rd world nation because of fear that there won't be a 2 party system? That Democrats won't tear themselves apart?  That somehow it's the job of Republicans to keep America down for as long as possible?  In 2017 we're going to toss our whole country out because maybe the evil deep state monster won't come out again?Joni Mitchell pointed to something in the nuclear aftermath film "Rebel without a cause."She points to one important item. That James Dean says to his father Jim Backus in the film:Backus: "I'm just trying to tell him with what you mean! You can't be idealistic all your life, Jim ..nobody nobody.." Dean: "**Accept yourself.**"Backhus: "**Wait a minute!**"Dean: "*Accept yourself.*"--- edit - fixed.[Shadows and Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1XFbhSMxIM)

Gay people make up about 10% of the population. If your bakery is the closest within range of 10,000 people, then we'd expect 1000 of those people to be gay.  Of those 1000, at least a few would like to get married. And when they do, they'll want cake. The fact that you and the dozens of people who upvoted you can't even conceive of the idea that a gay person can enter a bakery with no ill intent just like a straight person can is part of the problem.

1112	 sgiwhistleblowers	 BlancheFromage	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514783287	 Whatever you enjoy, that's good enough.  There's no need to overthink it; you need not justify it to anyone.  The fact that you enjoy it is its own explanation.  I have a small farm; we're approaching our biggest harvest of the year, and several other crops (that we can't sell) are coming in, so I'm making frequent trips to the food bank.  I have kittens!  I spend time with friends and enjoy my anti-cult activism.  I participate in a very busy online community (elsewhere); I do a lot of research (which I enjoy); and my dear husband is starting up a biotech, which I provide input to where appropriate.  I keep busy :)There's nothing wrong with yoga and meditation, but I would add a caution about fasting.  Generally, it's no big - people in the US eat way too much as it is.  The concern is where people are making unfounded, unsupportable claims about the health benefits of it - there is no such thing as any "cleanse" that can remove toxins or anything harmful from the body.Fasting is way more well-studied than most people realize; cancer patients waste, you see.  They fast - involuntarily.  And their excretions are carefully analyzed and monitored.  There are no harmful bacteria being shed, no heavy metals, no toxins, nothing but normal pee and poop - the digestive system makes sure of that. So if you want to fast to lose weight or to keep from gaining weight or just to run faster (the Khan Academy guy only eats once a day, at night, and then he consumes an entire day's worth of calories - says 'the lion runs fastest when he's hungry').  But it's not doing anything else for you, I'm afraid.There's a LOT of woo out there, and it's not just lightening people's wallets, it's actively harming their health.  If my perspective appears well-documented, that's because I've been actively researching these topics for several years now.  I've amassed a library of mostly rare and out-of-print books that include some truly fascinating early insights and research into the Soka Gakkai, the SGI's parent organization, and I've read them all.  One of my personal goals is to collect as many sources as I can find and include them here, where they can be safely backed up and protected from the SGI's efforts at "disappearing" sources from accessibility.  The Soka Gakkai/SGI is in a constant state of [retcon](https://www.google.com/search?q=reddit+sgiwhistleblowers+retcon&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS772US772&amp;oq=reddit+sgiwhistleblowers+retcon&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5911j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8).Remember that [Nichiren repeatedly asked the government to murder all the other Buddhist priests and burn their temples to the ground](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/2w0ttl/is_it_ever_okay_to_demand_that_the_government/) so that he, Nichiren, could be elevated to Japan's theological leader, whom the government would need to consult for guidance and prayers.  [None of Nichiren's predictions came true](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/2n0urw/why_nichirens_prophecies_do_not_count_as_such/); he truly *failed* in that regard, falsifying his claims to being a "sage" according to his own definition:&gt;When my prediction comes true, it will prove that I am a sage, but Japan will be destroyed. [Nichiren](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/2n0urw/why_nichirens_prophecies_do_not_count_as_such/)Japan was not destroyed O_ONot even *close*.Nichiren was big into [victim-blaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/2o26il/nichiren_loved_victimblaming_and_the_lotus_sutra/) - take a look at this putrid mess of hateful thinking:&gt;Slanderers of the True Dharma will be suffering in a large hell due to their cumulative evil karma of destroying the True Dharma. ... When their serious crime is reduced and they are allowed to be reborn in the human world, they will be born in the family of the blind, outcasts, or base people who clean toilets and bury dead bodies. Or they will be born without eyes, mouth, ears, or hands functioning properly.THAT's certainly "compassionate", isn't it?  Ridiculous scare tactics.   Sorry, that's not how true dharma could possibly manifest.  Nichiren's theology requires that [Shakyamuni Buddha completely changed his mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/6wa8fm/shakyamuni_prophesied_that_a_higher_teacher_of/) and did an about-face from self-responsibility and compassion to murder and mayhem - [no scholars of Buddhism believe that Shakyamuni taught the Lotus Sutra](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/5guf87/another_glaring_parallel_with_christianity_the/).  And even if he *had*, who could possibly trust someone who would do that sort of volte-face anyhow??Christianity split off from Judaism and tried to take over Judaism's scriptures (the Tanakh, which Christians rearranged and then named "Old Testament") and basic concepts (like "messiah"), which they of course re-defined to suit their own theology, and then claimed that God had changed all the rules - he now didn't *like* the Jewish people any more so he'd decided to break all his "eternal, unchanging, forever, for all your generations" promises to them (covenants) and change all the rules so as to give all the goodies to non-Jews, who would replace the Jews as God's NEW "Chosen People" in a *NEW* covenant!Similarly, what we see in the Lotus Sutra is that it opens with Shakyamuni supposedly telling all his followers, "Guys, I've been teaching you all wrong for the entire 40 years I've been teaching you, so just forget all that bullshit because NOW I'm *finally* going to teach you the *REAL* teachings!"  This is exactly the same as with the Judaism/Christianity bit above, *and because it's the religion's founder/author who's supposedly making the declaration*, nobody's allowed to argue about it!  See how this works?? [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/5humpb/how_about_another_parallel_between_christianity/)["Why would true dharma manifest itself in such an absurd way?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/4rpijj/why_would_true_dharma_manifest_itself_in_such_an/)Plus, Nichiren's key doctrines, which he claims he got out of the Lotus Sutra, [are not included anywhere in the Lotus Sutra](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/27bp1x/this_analysis_absolutely_destroys_nichiren/), so we have to trust Nichiren's "inspiration", when his authority lies in having gotten it out of the Lotus Sutra, where it isn't even to be found!The Lotus Sutra actually says everybody should [worship Kwanyin](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/6wfgwn/the_lotus_sutra_says_that_kwanyin_is_most/) - Nichiren carefully avoids that by claiming only TWO of the Lotus Sutra's chapters actually count.And besides, another of Nichiren's claims to authority rely on his living in the time period of Mappo, the eeeevil Latter Day of the Law, which is a defined time period 2000 years after Shakyamuni Buddha's death.  But to make it work, Nichirenists move Shakyamuni's life/death back several hundred years!  According to most people's understanding, Shakyamuni Buddha lived in the 5th Century BCE - even the SGI cites this time frame.  But that means that the Latter Day of the Law couldn't start until ca. 1500 CE - [several hundred years too late for Nichiren to be who he claimed to be, which was his basis for establishing his "True" religion](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/59dqm9/back_to_basics_when_did_shakyamuni_buddha_live/), too late for Nichiren to qualify as the Votary of the Lotus Sutra/Bodhisattva Jogyo, and invalidating all his claims of being the fulfillment of prophecy! It's like a puzzle of sorts, you see, with all these interconnected pieces, all of which are dependent upon the others being valid to themselves be valid.  And Nichiren's house of cards collapses utterly.  A favorite article is [Nichiren: The Original Face of Buddhist Terror](https://theendlessfurther.com/nichiren-the-original-face-of-buddhist-terror/).You know how the Buddha is depicted in various positions?  Nichiren is depicted as an angry little man with either a club or a whip.

1113	 DACA	 ccincu2018	 2018-01	 ['scapegoat']	 1514783291	  I just think you're misguided in thinking that they are the root of your struggles.  This person did not have any opportunities that you didn't have.  He didn't qualify for loans, grants or special scholarships.  He just worked his butt off and went the community college first route in order to afford his education.  You are free to speak your mind on this public thread but I'm also free to express my opinion that your complaints of your massive debt is simply your way of attempting to scapegoat a group of people more powerless than you for your own problems.  In truth, there are others like government bureacrats and banks that deserve the blame. I don't think that you have any obligation to help DACA recipients in any way.  It's a struggle that DACA recipients have the obligation to solve and if you are on our side, I think a lot of us are grateful.  But we don't expect you to fall in line with our views just because.Since you asked for an example, I'll give you one and you are of course free to do what you may with my example.  You care about student loan debt, an issue that Republicans and establishment Dems like Pelosi don't really GAF about.  So you seem like you have reasonable views.  It would help me (and perhaps help you) to vote for O'Rourke for Senate.  I feel like he is better on this issue (and other issues that may be beneficial to you) than Ted Cruz.  Plus Cruz is a slimy little politician that is hated by people in his own party and he cares more about banning dildos than about real issues.

At this point, for that to be true the following people and groups would have to be in on the conspiracy; various higher-ups at the the CIA &amp; FBI (members of which were so pro-Trump they leaked anti-Clinton stuff to Rudy Giuliani during the campaign) as well as other intelligence agencies, the (Republican) special counsel and his team (who were appointed by the Deputy Attorney General, also a Republican), the DNC (who would have to be willing to assassinate people over fairly dull and uneventful emails), various private cybersecurity companies hired to investigate the hacking (who concluded it was Russian hackers), a right-wing Australian diplomat and presumably the Australian intelligence service he reported to, Christopher Steele and his company, large swathes of the mainstream media (who would either have to be complicit or too incompetent to discover a gigantic conspiracy) as well as various congresscritters and senators, a number of whom are Republicans.Even if you deny the existence of the evidence implicating Russia in the email hacks, is it *really* plausible that so many people are in on a conspiracy? Like, what would the point of the conspiracy even be? Why and how would you convince several thousand disparate individuals scattered all over the world to make it look like Russia hacked some emails?

1125	 CBTS_Stream	 [deleted]	 2018-01	 ['jewish', 'jewish']	 1514783522	 Biblical prophecy doesn't relate to the church age. It's all Israel related. Every context within which prophecy passages situate are Jewish. The Jewish temple in Matthew 24 etc. Nothing in the Olivet Discourse (Matt. 24-25) mentions the church. Revelation 17, where the Whore of Babylon is mentioned, lends itself to many interpretations by Christians who have written their PhD dissertations on Rev 17, and others who just have prophecy as one of their focus'. Some think Babylon will literally exert a major presence by the time the seven-year Tribulation is underway (Daniel's 70th Week), and others think it refers to what, at the time John penned Rev, would end up being called the Roman Catholic Church, namely its hierarchy: the Pope and the teaching Magisterium, but mainly the Pope, who they think is the False Prophet, not the AntiChrist, who the Bible casts more often in political terms, not religious terms. Hence, they argue, the Pope as False Prophet is more congruent with the biblical data. For the reason that he obviously is a religious figure, not a political one.I don't think Hillary is the fulfillment of the "whore" passage in Rev 17, because she isn't "drunk with the blood of the saints," a part of Rev 17. She hasn't gone after Christians in some Christian specific serial killing across the globe. I'm of the persuasion that the seven-year Tribulation is all future (I'm a Futurist, not a Historicist, Idealist, or a Preterist), so the Whore of Babylon will not make its appearance until Daniel's 70th Week is well underway.Relax people. This is not the seven-year Tribulation we are in. What culture terms "Armageddon." Which should more aptly be called "the Campaign of Armageddon." That battle is the capstone of the Tribulation, not the whole thing. It's name in Hebrew means "Mount Meggido." It's in northern Israel.

1133	 Christianity	 nearlynoon	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514783757	 Looks like my answers have already been trod by my brethren, but I'll answer in my own words anyhow.1. Yes. The Fathers didn't canonize them based on the fact that everything Paul wrote needed to be canonized, but for their truth in the light of the faith.2. Yes, although 'reliability' in the sense you mean it isn't really what I gauge Gospels or other Biblical texts by. In any event, I don't have any issue with the idea of oral tradition being written down in stages according in some way to content.3. This is sorta a hard one. The virgin birth is an article of faith, it's an important part of the story that cannot be lost. I'm not sure how any sort of scholarship would proceed on that question beyond simply noting that virgins don't usually give birth. Otherwise it's a piece of religious scripture concerning poor people in the 1st century, it's not like everyone was lining up to write scientific treatises about them.4. This one is similar to the last one. You often won't get solid answers from theologians on these sorts of things, because the matter of 'DID exist' or 'DID NOT exist' is much, much less important to our religion than what he taught and what is attributed to him (freedom from slavery, written Torah, etc). Ultimately I am not an archaeologist worthy of arguing or even really comprehending the minutia of arguments for or against a historical Moses, and it matters not one iota to my faith if those formal myths were composed by generations of Jewish priests or a single king of prophets.Hope that helps.

To me it was just different that the opening scene was you running around a modern day airport shooting up innocent civilians and border security who don't stand a chance. It kinda sets the tempo that serious shit is about to go down after that level. You end up fighting the Russians through the suburbs of America and Washingtion DC which sounds like a far-fetched conspiracy theory that an Alex Jones fan predicting WW3 would dream of. I heard Modern Warfare was not the same after the 3rd one though.

As I was finishing my salad I hear a buzz and my brother drops his fork into his pasta and checks his phone. “It’s us, we gotta go.” I always hated this part. I sighed and left a hundred on the table and we opened the glass door exiting the restaurant and into the dark, rainy night.  My brother led me to his car. “We’ll take mine since it’s faster.” Pedestrians passing by glanced at us as they recognized our glowing emblem. I ignored the whispers of our organizations downfall and entered the vehicle. We sped down the road until we approached an alley with our buyer mounted against the building taking his final hits of his cigarette. He beckoned us to follow. “Take this,” my brother handed me his glock. “Why are you giving me this? This is yours.” He set both hands on the wheel “you said you were serious about taking your involvement with us further? Complete this and your in.” I looked at him with fear, “ just don’t get yourself killed”. I exited the car and followed our buyer down the puddle filled alleyway.  As we approached the end he turned to me and pointed to a crate tucked neatly behind a dumpster. I examined it and cracked it open just enough to see the contents. It was filled with explosives. “I’d like my payment now,” he snarled at me. “I know.” I pulled the glock up and delivered two bullets to his chest and one to his head splattering a pool of blood which quickly began to look like another rain puddle. My brother had the trunk already open. I drug the explosives and filled them in neatly. I slammed the trunk and looked passed the car to see a small crowd examining the alley. I ignored them and proceeded into the car. “One more arms merchant down. The rebels explosive supply will soon come to a hault.” My brother smiled, “Welcome to The New Law, brother.”	
1138	 exjew	 xiipaoc	 2018-01	 ['kosher']	 1514783806	 You could argue that kosher meat is more closely supervised so it won't have the kinds of health issues that could seep in if people aren't watching.  But in modern times that's not really so much of a problem, so if there's any difference it's minimal.  And even if it's watched, a mashgiach could always be unscrupulous, and he may not be watching every single cow that goes through, just getting a sample.  So you may be able to trust the meat a tiny bit more, but that's debatable and there is otherwise no difference.Pork is generally not the healthiest meat ever, but it's always going to depend on the cut.  A lean pork tenderloin is probably healthier than, say, a calf foot.  On the other hand, your average steak is going to be healthier than a plateful of crackling.  Bacon specifically is not what one would usually describe as a health food.  On the whole, beef is probably healthier than pork, but if you're eating cows or pigs on the whole, you've got yourself a different problem there!	
1139	 GenderCritical	 Historiasecreta	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514783813	 Aaaaand this is my peak trans.  I've been waiting for it for a year or two. The ladies' pond is something special. There is a big sign on the gate saying no men beyond this point, and it is a haven in the middle of London for women of all shapes, sizes, and religions (it gets a lot of orthodox Jewish women from the area just north). There is a meadow next to the pond that is the only place to topless sunbathe in the whole of London, and in summer it is packed. It is the first place I ever went that was women only and felt like a bonus for us, a place to just be, without any male gaze, a place that women got just for us, with camaraderie and seclusion and peace. Plenty of people find London busy and stressful, but in London or out it is one of the places I find most stress-releasing because it is so welcoming and womanly. It is genuinely one of my top five places in the world, and I feel like I've done a crap job of describing it even though I love it so much. There is a fucking mixed pond for anyone who wants it (and a men's pond), it's not like the whole of the Heath is a playground for gender dimorphism.  They've changed the changing rooms so that there are private cubicles now, and there never used to be, so I really don't give a shit about passing trans women using it. But it is a women's pond, and I will die on the hill of keeping it that way.

1141	 Buddhism	 Rks1157	 2018-01	 ['greed', 'greed']	 1514783846	 First understand that there is nothing wrong with sex from a Buddhist standpoint.   Monks and nuns must practice celibacy.  Many lay followers do the same  as an uposatha observance but this is not an absolute requirement.If these urges are troublesome  for you then you should learn how to cut off the source. The source being what you let in through the senses and the attention that you give to what does come in.  Sense restraint is one of the first lessons  a newly ordained monk was given in the Buddha's "gradual training." This lesson appears many times throughout the early Buddhist texts.  Here is an example from the Kumma Sutta;&gt;"Once upon a time, monks, a hard-shelled tortoise was foraging for food in the evening along the shore of a lake. And a jackal was also foraging for food in the evening along the shore of the lake. The tortoise saw the jackal from afar, foraging for food, and so — withdrawing its four legs, with its neck as a fifth, into its own shell — it remained perfectly quiet and still. But the jackal also saw the tortoise from afar, foraging for food, and so it went to the tortoise and, on arrival, hovered around it, [thinking,] "As soon as the tortoise stretches out one or another of its four limbs — or its neck as a fifth — I'll seize it right there, tear it off, and eat it." But when the tortoise didn't stretch out any of its four limbs — or its neck as a fifth — the jackal, not having gotten any opportunity, lost interest and left.&gt;"In the same way, monks, Mara is continually, ceaselessly, hovering around you, [thinking,] 'Perhaps I'll get an opportunity by means of the eye... the ear... the nose... the tongue... the body. Perhaps I'll get an opportunity by means of the intellect.' Thus, monks, you should dwell with the doors to your senses well-guarded.&gt;"On seeing a form with the eye, do not grasp at any theme or details by which — if you were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye — evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail you. Practice for its restraint. Guard the faculty of the eye. Secure your restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye.&gt;"On hearing a sound with the ear...&gt;"On smelling an aroma with the nose...&gt;"On tasting a flavor with the tongue...&gt;"On touching a tactile sensation with the body...&gt;"On cognizing an idea with the intellect, do not grasp at any theme or details by which — if you were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect — evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail you. Practice for its restraint. Guard the faculty of the intellect. Secure your restraint with regard to the faculty of the intellect.&gt;"When you dwell with the doors to your senses well-guarded, Mara, not getting any opportunity, will lose interest and leave, just as the jackal did with the tortoise."What has this got to do with sexual urges?   Pretty much everything.  Craving arises with feeling  conditioned by contact with the senses and a sense object.  No contact, no feeling; no feeling,  no craving.    We have the power to choose how much detail we take  in. And, we have the power to choose how much attention we give these details.  Practice this for a week and you'll see for yourself.

Which country are you aware of where the workers owned the means of production? I also haven't said that we should convert into a communist nation, although it wouldn't be terrible. My point is that communism isn't evil and there is nothing wrong with advocating it. People can be greedy in a communist society. The difference is that their greed would benefit everyone instead of just a select few.

1151	 AskHistorians	 Antique_futurist	 2018-01	 ['jewish', 'jewish', 'jewish', 'jewish']	 1514784054	 A considerable number of contemporary scholars would argue that the gospels are often reflecting their own context as-much-if-not-more than the historical record of Jesus' life, and so we therefore need to be *extremely* careful about taking the New Testament as a historical record for the crucifixion. For starters, all four gospels were written decades after the fact and contradict each other in both the recitation and interpretation of events. Just as importantly, the gospels were not written to provide an impartial historical record, but instead each gospel is trying to present a unique theological interpretation as to the life and meaning of Jesus, often in a fashion that more reflects the gospel-writers' context than Jesus'.So in the particular case of the crucifixion narratives, we have to ask ourselves: 'does this passage reflect the relationship of Jesus to the Jewish community around 30 CE or the relationship of the Christian and Jewish communities between 70 and 120 CE?' A significant number of scholars, looking at these passages, have come to the latter conclusion.The Gospel of Matthew goes beyond Luke, for instance, in stating that when Pilate 'washed his hands of the matter', the Jewish crowd responded "His blood be on us and on our children"(Matthew 27:24-25). If this reflects the historical reality, it means that a large crowd of Jews decided to take responsibility for Jesus' death in what reads like a mass-admission-of-guilt. On the other hand, if it reflects Matthew's situation what we have is an author trying to explain existing tensions between his own community and their non-Jesus-worshiping Jewish neighbors by tying his community's current troubles back to a single moment of division. These aren't necessarily mutually exclusive options, but they're also not contingent upon one another.I'd recommend Michael White's *From Jesus to Christianity* as an introduction to, well, most of these topics.

However, visit that link for an explanation of that effect.&gt;But, you talked about geometry, which was not offered as an explanation of the chromatic aberration (although it sort of is an explanation - the geometry of the lens) but as an explanation as to why the earth and moon look the sizes they do in that image.&gt;Moving the goalposts has not helped you here.AND MY REPLY:this is the explanation in the second link for chromatic aberration in wikipedia:"Photographic example showing high quality lens (top) compared to lower quality model exhibiting lateral chromatic aberration (seen as a blur and a rainbow edge in areas of contrast.)"So a multi-million dollar satellite has a low quality lense? Does that make any fucking sense to you? That a state of the art satellite that costs tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars, has a low quality lens?Besides, NASA itself gives an explanation as to the GREEN ARTIFACT on their web site and it has nothing to do with Chromatic Aberration!---Your second point, nobody is moving the goal posts, I'm simply pointing out the childish explanations offered by so called 'science-based' mods-----then the poster apparently, created an entirely new account or switch for some unknown reason, this time with a new explanation. My point is this, these so called 'skeptics' just churn out skepto-babble.

The tax bill, neutering of our regulations, and the biggest threat is he and the republicans are stacking the courts with right wing fanatics.As I've stated previously, history will not be kind to Hillary. After losing the most winnable election (in Her and her supporter's minds) she cooked up the Russian conspiracy and way too many people believe it. We're watching the return of McCarthyism that could have dangerous repercussions. We have only 1 party because both parties agree that their donors should have free rein over the rest of us. Both parties are willingly destroying what's left of our democracy, our civil liberties, ect. And they are both complicit in destroying any country that they see fit so their masters can steal other country's resources.   	
1159	 television	 thekonzo	 2018-01	 ['holocaust']	 1514784250	 I mean, to be fair, there are good comedians that dont rely on burns at all. There are shitty ones that cant do anything but insult in somewhat creative ways.    It is not always okay to joke about everything, like tragedies and victims. You can often get around it by being smart, self-aware, trustworthy and funny, but there are those that fail and just end up being stupid, unfunny, perpetuating and banking on hatred and character assassination.   It is not gonna be illegal, but if I owned a venue, Id probably ban a joker that -while a holocaust was ongoing- made a very bad joke about jews. And I think its okay for consumers to criticize, protest, boycott in those extreme cases.    Luckily Chappelle did more than fine imo.

It tends to mirror the patient populations in major cities of America.Let me elaborate. There are very few genetic disorders taught in preclinicals that are particular to East Asians, yet to me it seemed to me that a large portion of metabolic/genetic disorders I've learned about in M1 year occur mostly in Western European population, i.e. hemophilia, factor V Leiden, Bernard Soilier's, ALS, MS, hereditary hemochromatosis, LHON, cystic fibrosis, etc. This is obviously because a huge portion of the American population is European in origin.Some of these diseases are very rare, but they are given equal representation on the boards. As a Korean I can tell you with confidence that we have not discussed any genetic disorders particular to Koreans. And that is totally OK with me. Koreans (and East Asians in general) are a tiny proportion of the patient population in America, and this small population does not show founder effect/bottleneck problems. There is also no shortage of other genetic disorders that are represented in American (including minorities), such as autosomal dominant PCKD, thalassemias, Kawasaki disease, porphyrias, mitochondrial disorders, etc. that we have to study for the boards.You also cannot forget that Jewish people, especially Ashkenazi Jews, are overrepresented in all fields of science, medicine, and the arts. Do Jonas Salk, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, J. Roberet Oppenheimer ring a bell? 28% of Nobel Prize winners in medicine have been Jewish, although Jews comprise less than 0.2% of the world's population. I feel like with this level of contribution that if there were any ethnic group to have outsized influence on medicine, it should be Ashkenazi Jews.In addition, the United States has one of the largest Jewish populations in the world, second only to Israel. With an estimated 7 million Jewish people in the United States, and greater concentration of Jewish people in urban as opposed to rural areas, just about every medical student planning to practice medicine in a city will have multiple Jewish patients in the future.Finally the Ashkenazi Jewish population is an excellent learning example to help students understand concepts like founder effect, genetic drift, consanguinity, bottlenecks, etc, and the diseases the population tends to have are also illustrative of several biochemical processes, e.g. Tay Sachs for gangliosides, lysosomal storage disorders. This leads into the most important point relevant to the OP's question, which I will directly quote from Wikipedia:&gt;There are many references to Ashkenazi Jews in the literature of medical and population genetics. Indeed, much awareness of "Ashkenazi Jews" as an ethnic group or category stems from the large number of genetic studies of disease, including many that are well reported in the media, that have been conducted among Jews. Jewish populations have been studied more thoroughly than most other human populations, for a variety of reasons:Jewish populations, and particularly the large Ashkenazi Jewish population, are ideal for such research studies, because they exhibit a high degree of endogamy, yet they are sizable.[164]Jewish communities are comparatively well informed about genetics research, and have been supportive of community efforts to study and prevent genetic diseases.[164]The result is a form of ascertainment bias. This has sometimes created an impression that Jews are more susceptible to genetic disease than other populations.[164] Healthcare professionals are often taught to consider those of Ashkenazi descent to be at increased risk for colon cancer.[165]

And the funny thing is I didn't even like Louis after the whole bernie silencing and I'm a shill for hillary thing.

The committee is tasked with picking the 4 best teams not the 4 deserving teams or 4 conference champs.  Cry all you want cause your team didn’t get picked.  Even go so far to claim there must be a conspiracy cause your team was left out.  Can’t wait for the games to kick off tomorrow.  My money is on undeserving bama to win it all..  what you think??	
1167	 conspiracy	 WSOPMainEventChamp17	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy', 'conspiracy']	 1514784412	 Can't like this post enough. You speak the truth when you say "In many ways, the powerful people in this country are to blame for the divisiveness among the lower and middle class. They probably orchestrate much of the divisiveness. At the very least, they inadvertantly cause it and propagate it." And I like this next quote. "A mixture of ideas from both parties is most likely the right answer." I agree with this opinion. What does it take to make a 3rd and 4th party viable? They aren't viable now because they get shit coverage and bias from the fucking media that "reports" "news" "about" "political" "elections." And another reason, may be related to the first one, is that people don't fucking vote for the 3rd/4th parties. Most people have heard that you're "wasting" your vote if you vote 3/4 party. The name itself is even meaningful. Why would you vote 4th party when you could vote 1st party? One thing is for sure: we need a few more parties to choose from because the current "two" fuck us over on the reg. Not all of them, but there is allegedly a group. As a Conspiracy subreddit how valuable and revealing would it be to create our own party which has actual benefit for humanity based off of nuanced principals? Seriously. It would probably be fucked up. But I would like to see what R/conspiracy could come up with, as if creating a new political party.

1179	 todayilearned	 Ksieba7	 2018-01	 ['merchant']	 1514784617	 Yeah, minority cultures tend to be exposed to these stereotypes until they identify with the shitty stereotypes that are forced on them. That still doesn’t make it okay, despite the gilded comments in here saying otherwise. Popularity and/or acceptance by the ethic group being stereotyped doesn’t suddenly nullify the racist/sexist/etc stereotypes in cartoons. Also see: Pepe Le Peu, Apu, Aladdin’s Merchant, Sebastian from Little Mermaid, the Indians from Peter Pan, the countless racist Looney Toons and Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons, etc etc

1183	 slatestarcodex	 nomenym	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514784668	 It used to be, once upon a time, that being anti-racist did not include a commitment to the position that differences between people, or groups of people, could not possibly have anything to do with their genetic diversity. That would be odd. Who would want to hang their moral opposition to racism on such an improbable proposition? What if it turned out to be false? Would that justify racism? Would it justify a conspiracy to cover up the truth?If one concedes that differences in genetic inheritance at least partly explain differences in life outcomes between members of the same race, shouldn't that, according to this same reasoning, justify prejudice and discrimination against smaller related groups, like extended families? If I know that John is a criminal, shouldn't we also throw John's brother in jail, even if he has not yet committed any crime, just to be on the safe side? After all, he's statistically more likely to commit crime, right? In fact, the case here is far stronger than it is for mere members of the same race.It's cynicism dressed up like idealism. Apparently, mankind is so hopelessly tribal, so hopelessly groupish, that they cannot handle such facts. People are, ironically, inherently incapable of treating each other as individuals. If some groups have lower average intelligence because of the particulars of their genetic inheritance, then other groups will be inevitably be inspired to oppress them and deny them their rights. Meanwhile, more intelligent members of these unfortunate groups will inevitably feel personally insulted by facts that say nothing directly about any individual at all. Behind the apparent hopeful idealism in the claim genetics has no role to play, there is a deep and hopeless cynicism that we must commit ourselves to that claim regardless of whether it's true because people cannot be trusted to think otherwise.And maybe they're right. I'm actually receptive to such arguments. I think many myths are socially useful, especially for binding together people in solidarity who would otherwise be at each others throats. However, the same people propping up modern myths about race, seemingly in the name of solidarity, are busily trying to tear down all the old myths that bound people together in the past. It feels a whole lot like the old ways of being racist are just out of fashion. Perhaps the problem is that their deep and hopeless cynicism is neither deep nor hopeless enough, because it turns out that human beings are so racist that it doesn't matter what they believe about genetic inheritance, because they'll apparently just come up with some other convoluted way of justifying racism.In any case, by modern standards, and according to the edicts of those who apparently own the words "racist" and "sexist", near enough most of the population is racist and sexist, especially you.

1192	 CryptoCurrency	 esotericape	 2018-01	 ['merchant', 'merchant', 'merchant']	 1514784896	 SWIM analyzed and posted a good response in the bitcointalk forums, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1381323.9600This attack wants to1. First control the merchant's computer or internet connection (in simple terms that the merchant is hacked),2. Next also control all the nodes/peers in the raiblocks network so that the merchant is not able to verify the transactionBut this is not enough...3. The attacker wants to control raiblocks.net (again does he mean one node here? because anyone can run a different node, like https://raiblocks.club  .. or does he mean attack the representative nodes? )Is the attacker a super power controlling the entire Internet? Thats what this sounds like.Its like saying the USD is also quite vulnerable to the entire online banking system being hacked and someone adding zeros onto all account balancesAlso there are several wrong ideas about Raiblocks that this "article " suggests:&gt;Quote&gt;1) A payment to be accepted should require a vote with a minimum weight quorum. It's difficult to establish a correct quorum, &gt;and if that quorum is offline no payments will be processed.This is false. A vote takes place only if there is a fork (ie. malicious transaction.). This can happen only when the send transaction is tampered with before creation. In every instance of such a transaction. The entire network looks at it with extreme scrutiny because they generally do not exist in the system. This is clearly explained in the whitepaper&gt;Quote&gt;A payment need to be accepted by some trusted representativesAgain false.&gt;Quote&gt;RaiBlocks is just Bitcoins without the Bitcoin securing algorithmNo need to explain such stuff, XRB is not even related to bitcoin in any way, except if you look at it from an account perspective where each account can be looked as a blockchainClearly shows you have no idea about what RaiBLocks is when you say "Raiblocks is just Bitcoin"The only thing of any substance in this article is the 52% weight of representative nodes, but that is again split in 6 different representatives and with new exchanges and merchants coming to the ecosystem, this will only reduce the weight, thus making the representatives more decentralised Overall this is a terrible article which does not even understand the whitepaper and compares it with a bitcoin to see where the differences are.If someone is making such topics on security vulnerabilities least they can do is come up with better points to debate

1196	 destiny2	 TaggedYouUp	 2018-01	 ['greed']	 1514784942	 We're almost in total agreement, the only thing that I have an issue with is your stance on a subscription replacing the eververse. Many games have existed before without micro transactions, they were born purely out of greed and have no place in triple A games. These devs and publishers have created quality games in the past that made their profits on game sales and DLC add ons alone. My point is that if you feel the need to pack your game full of micro transactions and this eververse garbage to have confidence that you'll make back the money you have poured into the game - then it probably isn't a very good game to begin with. I absolutely would not purchase a full priced game with a monthly subscription that suffers from a lack of content and I would wager that more than half of the player base would agree that it is unnecessary. Current PS4 and Xbox One tech is not up to date and games that are being developed for these systems aren't up to date either.No game to be released on current generation of consoles is worth the full price of a triple A game with a subscription model, as well as the micro transactions and loot crates that would inevitably be duct taped onto the game regardless. I get where you're coming from though, but I think you're maybe giving Activision too much leeway. I could be interpreting your point wrong so in case I have, I don't mean any offence.Ps: yeah I don't get adventures either, I feel like it was supposed to be something bigger at the start but maybe ran out of time or space on the current gen systems - just a theory.

1199	 ShitWehraboosSay	 Andrakian	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514784955	 I'm brazilian. I'll try shedding some light on what people like him think. And rant. Mostly rant.First, I fully believe he's a fascist. People here love Pinochet. They want ancap, but at the same time want a borderline fascist state to stomp out the commies. They flat out can't understand the contradiction.- Our schools only began teaching philosophy and sociology around 10 years ago, and even then they are by far the subjects with the smallest time slot.- Our history curriculum was drafted in the 1930's, and changed little since then.- Most people in our media outlets received their positions during the dictatorship. Many of them were supporters of the regime. - Notice his complaint about "communist teachers"? Teachers, according to a view born during the dictatorship and that endures well into today, are paid by the big bad evil government to carry forward the chinese and russian conspiracy against Brazil. University teachers are the worse of the lot, of course.Since school is bad for you and should be ignored, the average brazilian receives all his (very, very little) political education from his parents. The result is some kind of cargo cult. Left = evil. Right = good. No exceptions. You are *born* into a political orientation, with the poor and black being born left-wing and the middle-class/rich and white being born right-wing. And since the rich are obviously better, the right wing is better. Good politics is not the system that works right, is the system that repeats human nature. And human nature, of course, is a dog eat dog world. Anything different from that is leftist unmanly-ness. Being a charismatic leader is much, much more important than actually having ideas - because ideas are dangerous and the important truths are the ones you are born knowing. People sincerely believe this. With all their hearts.It's this weird situation where people talk about politics *without actually talking about politics*. And every time something with an ounce of confidence comes around, people *worship* it. Because they don't have the necessary equipment to separate passionate but well tought-out ideas from a bum rambling on the street.

1207	 blackmirror	 LiteralHeadCannon	 2018-01	 ['scapegoat']	 1514785186	 I understand that police brutality is already an unpleasant fact of life and has been for a long time, but I think that the fantastic episode Shut Up And Dance proves that plausible events enabled by already-existing technology are fully within the scope of Black Mirror.  The point of Flyswatter isn't that the officers escape justice in the end - it's that the swatter *enables* the officers to escape justice by providing a scapegoat to shift blame to.  The legal system really wants to give the officers excessive leeway, but it would have been much harder to justify doing so if you couldn't point to a devil figure and say "look, he did this, he lied to them to make this happen".  The officers have a ludicrously long leash by default, but given the things they indisputably did on film, it still wouldn't have been enough to save them if they hadn't had a third party to shift the anger to.  And sure, he really is guilty, at least of manslaughter and most likely of some kind of felony murder, because all kinds of things could have gone lethally wrong even if the officers had actually followed good protocols correctly, but it's still totally unreasonable to say that he should have expected officers of the state to slaughter an entire family out of a mix of tenuously-enabled sadism and a failed attempt to cover their tracks after it becomes apparent they fucked up - or if it *is* reasonable to say that, then what the fuck does that *say* about the state?

So I read several books and researched, etc.I think I became interested because of several old videos on youtube (from the 70s) that showed the family and life in Iran at that time (which was good). It broke my heart knowing that this family had been driven out of their homeland and has never been able to return. It angered me to know that Jimmy Carter turned his back on them too.For the record, I'm an American Jew.

1216	 AskReddit	 HicMasterPimp	 2018-01	 ['merchant', 'merchant']	 1514785476	 It actually makes me feel better hearing you say this. I'm from North Idaho, I go to Seattle 5 to 6 times a year. Mostly for work.I've come to believe that people in Seattle don't eat. I once set up a show at the convention center. As it was going to be a long long day I decided to take a late lunch. At 3:30.  I went to the subway. They had just closed for the day which was the first thing i found odd. They opened because 4 of us were ordering and they had not yet put the food away. I ordered a cold cut trio, large soda and chips.  $15.00??? Like i said I'm from Idaho, former logger I would usually order 2 footlongs. 5 minutes later another person came in and ordered. They told her $14.w/e. She was from central Washington and said "aren't they $5" Nope. She didn't have the cash on her and asked if they took checks? (I know hilarious) they said no. I came from a farm family and knew exactly what was happening. I paid for the excess money for her lunch. (She later tried to repay)2 weeks later I went to a Seahawks game with a few friends. We stopped to get gas. A burger king was next door. I told them they better eat because there is no food in Seattle. I ate 2 whoppers, fries and a milkshake. No one else ate. We arrived in Seattle, checked into our little place. (The red room above Merchant's Inn, check it out!!! AMAZING) Merchant's Inn has amazing cheese curds. (If you are ever in Seattle this is something you should eat.) (Possibly the only food available in town)(There might be a hot dog stand In the area) After eating some fried cheese curds with honey dip. We start drinking. Saturday's are mostly a blur because of Friday's hangover. (Remember there is no food in Seattle!) Start Sunday with a bloody Mary downstairs. (Because this is food in Seaattle) Walk towards the game (it's 6 blocks tops) Slowly begin to realize  that even though you haven't eaten anything but bud light and a couple asparagus schutes(shootes?(Because I'm drunk and can't figure it out)) that because you ate 2 days ago that you are the most normal person in town.At the game eat a burger($12.00(nachos are also available)) (this IS the food available in Seaatle)After the game call Jeremy he rides one of those "rickshaw" bikes. Eat some more cheese curds have a couple more $4.00 budlights goto bed....Wake up, Pay $70.00 for your 2.5 days of parking. (A deal for Seattle) Drive to Moses Lake or Ellensburg  and stop at the truck stop for meal #2 of the weekend. Get to North Idaho, order anything anywhere and feel normal.

I generally liked the book, but it became a little repetitive. Heroes go to Planet X ...get in gunfight...goes to this base ...gets in gun fight...flies to secret base...gunfight. At times it focused more on the political/ conspiracy /horror thriller elements than sci fi.  I’m interested to see how the next book plays out.

The RAM I chose is the cheapest and fastest 32GB kit, as speed benefits Ryzen. You can definitely use Elgato with it.The build has 2 drives because one is for boot and the other for mass storage, since SSDs boot OS' within 10 seconds nowadays, and having a large HDD gives room for all files and allows for priority games to be placed on the SSD, improving their loading time by a bit.

1231	 tipofmytongue	 transcriptase	 2018-01	 ['merchant', 'scapegoat']	 1514785815	 [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/75gdgf/what_are_some_facts_that_are_actually_false/do5y3ky/)?The myth that Titanic was in any way badly designed, badly built, or badly operated by the standards of the time. In fact there are so many ridiculous inaccuracies surrounding Titanic that it's hard to list even a fraction of them here...She was an incredibly seaworthy ship - much more so than any passenger ship around today. The iceberg tore a gash almost a third of the way down her side, and she still stayed afloat for more than two hours!In that time, all but two of her lifeboats were launched - there wasn't time to launch any more. She could have had a hundred more lifeboats on board, but that wouldn't have helped without vastly more crew to operate them.Titanic's passengers genuinely did believe that she was practically unsinkable. When the time came to begin loading the lifeboats, many thought they would be safer staying on Titanic. There wasn't time for the crew to wait around convincing more people to get in, so when a lifeboat was ready, if there was no-one else waiting to get in, it had to go. This is why so many of Titanic's lifeboats left only half-full - the crew weren't worried about over-filling them.Titanic wasn't travelling too fast for the conditions - by the standards of practice around at the time. Further precautions were put into practice after the incident, but no-one on board can be blamed for doing what anyone on any ship would have done the same.Titanic was by no means a fast ship - nor was she ever intended to be. The White Star Line (Titanic's owners) were in competition with one other big shipping line, Cunard. Cunard's liners (Mauretania, Lusitania and later Aquatania) were the fastest in the business. To combat this, instead of fighting for speed, White Star decided to try to make their liners the most luxurious in the world. Olympic and Titanic were famed for their splendour and comfort - passengers said that it was easy to forget that you were at sea, as there were very few vibrations from the engines, and the ships remained stable even in fairly rough seas. By comparison, Cunard's liners were very fast, but their quadruple-screw configuration made vibration more apparent. It's a myth that Titanic was ever trying to make record-breaking speed across the Atlantic.She wasn't built using sub-standard materials. This rumour goes around a lot these days because of an article that was written some time ago - what the article is supposed to mean is that there is much better quality steel available today. This was not the case in 1909. Additionally, Titanic's builders were paid on a fee plus materials basis - they were given a set fee to construct the ship, plus the cost of all materials used. There was no incentive to use anything but the best steel they could get their hands on. The shipyard had an excellent reputation and would not risk tainting it by using bad steel, which could easily be noticed on inspection anyway.Titanic and her two sister ships Olympic and Britannic were also surprisingly manoeuvrable for their size - much more so than was expected. Some will tell you that Titanic's rudder was too small, but this simply isn't true. In fact, Olympic's wartime captain marvelled at her manoeuvrability, and was even able to throw her into a sudden turn, ramming (and sinking) a German U-boat. Olympic was the only merchant vessel throughout the First World War recorded to have sunk an enemy vessel.While it's true that the lookouts' binoculars were misplaced (or rather, locked away in a cabinet that no-one on board had the key to open), this made no difference to Titanic's fate. The images of sea captains and pirates scanning the horizon through telescopes, while common in films, has virtually no stead in reality. Binoculars and telescopes narrow your field of vision down to a fine point, making it harder to spot anything. Lookouts on real ships will use their eyes alone to search for objects of interest, and once they've been spotted, will use a set of binoculars to further inspect it. Titanic's lookouts would not have been using their binoculars to search for iceberg even if they'd had them.Third class passengers were never trapped below decks - the big metal gates you might remember from the film never even existed. The only time passengers were kept below decks was near the beginning of the disaster, when the officers needed time to prepare the lifeboats. First and second class passengers were allowed on deck, but as there were so many more third-class passengers the crowd was asked to stay below for a short while, until the officers were ready to start loading lifeboats. No-one was ever locked up. In fact a higher percentage of third-class males survived the sinking than second-class males.Titanic was the largest ship in the world, but not by much - her older sister Olympic was identical in almost every way. A few changes to Titanic's layout (including the covering up of some promenade decks, making them count as interior space) made her technically larger, but both ships were exactly the same length, breadth and height. Olympic had a GRT (gross registered tonnage) of 45,324 gross register tons. Titanic's GRT was some 1,000 tons greater. After the disaster, Olympic received a refit, after which her GRT was up to about 30 more than Titanic's had been. But Titanic's younger sister, Britannic, which was launched after the disaster and had been modified during construction as a result of it, was about 2 feet wider than her sisters and had a GRT more than 2,000 tons greater than Titanic's.White Star Line's owner, Bruce Ismay, likely had nothing to do with the incident. Another myth popularised by the film is that Ismay had convinced Captain Smith to sail faster and try to get to New York in record time. He's also portrayed as a bumbling idiot, and sneaks onto a lifeboat when the officers aren't looking. While we'll never know whether or not Ismay really did discuss Titanic's schedule with Smith, it's incredibly unlikely - Smith was looking to retire after commanding Titanic, had an extremely good reputation, and was a much-loved public figure. Passengers scrambled to sail on a ship under his command. He is unlikely to have been swayed to make rash decisions based on Ismay's need for Titanic to make headlines. Ismay himself played an active role during the sinking, helping passengers into lifeboats and doing what he could where possible (one officer recalled telling him to get out of the way as he was making a nuisance of himself by getting involved, but testified that he was trying to help). Ismay stepped into an empty spot on one of the last boats to leave the ship, just as it was preparing to lower. He didn't take anyone else's space. Unfortunately the media needed a scapegoat, and he was the highest-ranking official to survive the disaster. He adopted a secluded lifestyle after the disaster, funding several naval charities but otherwise staying out of the public eye.Higher watertight compartments or compartments sealed at the top would not have saved the ship - Most people could tell you that Titanic sunk because the weight of the water in the foremost watertight compartments pulled the bow down, allowing the water to spill over the top into more compartments, and so-on throughout the ship. But had Titanic's watertight bulkhead walls run all the way to the top deck, she might actually have sunk faster - with so much water contained in the front third of the vessel, she would have begun to tilt forwards much earlier, and possibly have broken in two sooner than she did. Sealing the tops of the bulkheads to prevent water from spilling over is actually illegal, and still is today. The International SOLAS (Safety Of Life At Sea) Regulations state that no civil (non-military) vessel can have any obstruction above watertight compartments that could impede a passenger's escape. The bottom line is that Titanic was damaged beyond her specifications, and was doomed from the moment she hit the iceberg."Full Astern" - There's a belief (popularised by the film) that Titanic's engines were thrown full astern on sighting the iceberg, and that this may have hindered her ability to turn away from it. This rumour started because of evidence given by the fourth officer, who who wasn't even on the bridge at the time of the collision. The only survivor who was present was the quartermaster, but from his position in the wheelhouse he couldn't see the commands sent to the engine room on the bridge telegraphs. Survivors from the engine room and the boiler rooms attested that the command was "stop" rather than "astern". Whoever you choose to believe, when you think about the timescale it really makes very little difference. There was less than 40 seconds between the iceberg sighting and the collision - and in that time, the lookouts had to ring the bell, pick up the phone, wait for 6th officer Moody to enter the wheelhouse and answer it, and alert him to the iceberg; then, Moody relayed that order to the most senior officer on the bridge (1st Officer Murdoch); Murdoch ordered the turn to port, then crossed to the telegraph to send the order to stop. Try acting that out in real time, and work out how long the engineers had to act on the "stop" order - not long enough. There's a really good article explaining exactly what went on in the engine rooms here; this goes into a lot more detail than I can, and comes to the same conclusions. Long story short - there wasn't even enough time to stop the engines, let alone put them in reverse. Slowing down or keeping full-ahead would have had no difference, as the turning circle stays the same. Leaving the starboard engine running may have turned Titanic's bow away from the iceberg, but it would have made it more difficult to keep the stern away.

I've said that you can see it when looking at the holocaust, not that the hate speech is the same as the holocaust.Why do you think the holocaust happened? It wasn't that people just suddenly thought "Oh, let's kill some Jews". Why do you think Jews were specifically targeted?It all started many years before Hitler, cause there was already Hate speech against Jews. Not only in Germany, but throughout the whole world. When the Nazis came to power the hate speech worsened, of which the end result was the holocaust. And while the holocaust is worse than hate speech, hate speech is what allowed it to happen. If there was no hate speech, then there is no way so many people would've supported it. The prejudice against Jews that came from hate speech is one of the most important factor in it.

Netanyahu is coming to the U.S. to plea for his people against Iran (the evil Haman) on the week of Purim? Is that God or what?"For all intents and purposes, I'm not criticizing the Jewish belief itself here. I actually admire it somewhat as a survival mechanism that ensures protection of ones kin. I was raised Christian and I never saw any celebration of anyone's death promoted. I think such "noble" behavior is idiotic and destructive as it encourages others to attack ones self, I can't morally justify allowing the increased hate and attacks on other European peoples to go on and doing nothing. I can't justify allowing young European children to be raised in a world that is increasingly designed to attack and oppress them for their race and/or culture. People who organized genocides of European Christian peoples need to receive an animalistic level hate to the extent that they are ripped apart and desecrated. People like Trotsky who killed peasants and destroyed churches [should have their graves dug up, bodies desecrated and spat on, and legacy burned](http://i.magaimg.net/img/13ps.png).People like Talaat Pesha and the Donmeh Jewish Young Turks who genocided Armenian/Greek Christians should have [their assassinations celebrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Nemesis) passionately.I'm gonna repeat here; I condemn the **individual** Jews (as well as any other people of any race) who genocided and oppressed European peoples, but I'm not judging or condemning the Jewish people as a whole, and I'm not even criticizing the Jewish practice. I actually admire the Jewish practice of tribal defensiveness, and I'm seeking to emulate it. There is a current sickening element of traditional "be a white man" do-good mentality that allows ethno-masochism, and this disgusting mindset needs to be exterminated.

1250	 btc	 mungojelly	 2018-01	 ['merchant', 'merchant', 'merchant']	 1514786118	 Well this is an issue we've been having for a long long time, which is what counts as adoption exactly? What counts as using Bitcoin? Clearly somewhere there's going to be a transition between where you touch the economy with bitcoin and the bulk of the economy that runs on something else. If you use a credit card that transforms the coin for you, then the transition point is before you even contact the merchant. If the merchant accepts BitPay but they transform it into fiat instantly then it doesn't get past the point of sale. It's a little better if the merchant actually accepts crypto and holds it at all, but they're still probably going to have to cash it all out for their expenses which are still probably in fiat.It seems to me that what would help the most would be to use it with merchants who have low marginal costs. If you use crypto to pay for a massage, for instance, then the massage therapist doesn't *have* to use the crypto to buy massage oil, so they can hold it if they want to. Or like it would be good if you could get someone to accept crypto at a yard sale, because it's just extra money for them and so they can hold it or spend it on whatever. Buying gasoline is going to be the most difficult of anything to get the crypto to actually touch the underlying market, what with the petrodollar. I guess buying it with a card connected to crypto is some sort of crypto something but it doesn't feel to me like it helps any more than any other way of buying fiat.

I mean......if she really did know anything about Christianity she would know that most men were much older than wives, that children are supposed to leave their parents and cleave to their spouses, and that pride/vanity/greed/despondency/stealing are all sins. I guess that only applies to others, not to her because it seems despair and despondency are bestest friends in the whole world, lol.

Kirito's group of friends isn't exactly inconspicuous to SAO survivors, consisting of The Black Swordsman, The Flash, a beloved mid-floor idol, one of the best player-blacksmiths, a well-established shady-but-reliable merchant, and the leader of a well-respected and skilled clearing group guild. They also have an already very well known in ALO Sylph, and Sinon is quite the idol in GGO (especially post-PB) and I'm sure that carries over to SAO as well.On top of being well-known *people*, they don't exactly lay low in ALO, notably aiding the Sleeping Knights to clear a floor boss, clearing floors in general, Kirito slicing magic with dual blades, and the legendary duel between The Black Swordsman and Zekken... and that's just *Mother's Rosario*.&amp;nbsp;"Subtle" is not a word that really applies to them at all, and it's really just Japan's polite and reserved culture that keeps them seeming more "normal", at least by what we would expect a group like them to be treated like in a Western setting.

1270	 AskReddit	 journeyman369	 2018-01	 ['jewish']	 1514786481	 Well, I'll tell my story - might be a bit of a long read, for whoever's interested..I was raised by Peruvian "upper class" parents, in other words white skinned with a lot of money. My mother, now dead after an apparent suicide last year, always bossed around the lower classes and did everything in her power to always get her way. She was manic depressive, which is something that I obviously don't blame her for, but also addicted to cocaine and alcohol, which made matters worse.In Perú one is deemed by most of white society as a "cholo" if one has darker skin. Racism is very real there. Classism is also very real to this day, and it's very disturbing.  My father is a Jewish fraudster (been to jail before for bank fraud) who studied engineering and made hundreds of thousands of dollars in his early twenties, somehow. He never really cared about anybody with few funds or who is not in his "social status". Regardless of religion, my father married my mother due to money and "connections". We received political asylum in Costa Rica back in '86 after my father commited major bank fraud in Perú.Both of my parents considered (and my father still considers) people with little funds as subhuman. My mother always said exactly that in the midst of her coke and alcohol fueled insanity.My mother did not raise me at all - she had no time for petty things like raising her children. Her maids did. My father paid for my education - not because he cared, but because he wanted to look good with his connections. And well, for many rich people, connections mean money.My father's family are highly conservative Jews with a lot of money, and they also have maids and treat people with less money than they do like garbage. My mother's family - all Catholic - are the same way. Maids and chauffeurs and everything. No difference there. Also, my siblings inherited their parents' discrimination towards people with a lower income. They treat lower class people like garbage. They're not even human in their eyes.My sister - not much different in character to how my mother was - refused to have an autopsy performed on her. It was a quick cremation. My aunt also commited suicide about a decade before her, so it runs in the family. For my maternal family, it wouldn't be good for business for people to know that there were two suicides in the family, and that there are other "less fortunate" family members at risk, and that they're doing fuck all about it. The thing is that my mother told me that she would end her life, but nobody believes me, as to their eyes I'm "unstable". My fucking sister covered it up.No - I'm not in touch with any member of my family, and don't think I ever will be. They shunned me as well for not having enough funds, having clinical depression, and never "making it" like they did. It's ok though.. I shunned them back, and I'm embarrassed to call them family.So you see, it even happens among family members. If one doesn't have enough funds, one is not worthy and a waste of space.	
1271	 conspiracy	 [deleted]	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514786497	 Submission Statement:My post hopes to amplify the conspiracy of silence in much of major main stream media related to a double standard applied to politicians- in particular to the (former President and former Senator/Secretary of State/First Lady) Clintons. Were the same standards applied to everyone, as has been recently applied to [ruined] popular and famous individuals, merely accused, *some second-handedly and/or without testimony or affidavit* of sexual abuse/indiscretions or of unlawful activities, the former President and Mrs. Clinton would certainly not be enjoying the often glowing celebrity and/or invitations to public media events, speaking engagements and commercial endorsements that they are enjoying.Public record court documents, clearly defining the nature and extent of the former president's wholly inappropriate affairs with a subordinate, public/televised lies that were proffered by the chief executive and his spokespersons, and perjury leading to the impeachment of the former president, clearly support the description I chose for the title.https://www.thenation.com/article/sodomy-masses/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/president-clinton-impeachedSimilarly, gross fiduciary malfeasance and administrative irresponsibility has been documented and is being unveiled in a controlled manner, a drip, drip, drip of back-tracking, side-stepping, and "not that big a deal" edicts - all euphemisms for the litany of activities, any number of which would lead to charges and likely indictment for the vast majority of private citizens, military members, or administrative government officials. Having been glossed over and obfuscated by sympathetic co-conspirators among the administrative, legislative, and judicial branches, constant main stream media gloating have overshadowed and diminished the seriousness of actions with regard to both the handling of classified documents, and the ongoing allegations of monetized favoritism within the The State Department and various Clinton foundation(s) and charitable entities. Instead of being the actions a "smartest person" these are the behaviors of a favor-peddling, selfish megalomaniac who placed personal power and wealth over duty or any responsibility to their oath of office.https://townhall.com/columnists/dwwilber/2015/08/27/smartest-woman-in-the-world-n2043271http://www.politifact.com/personalities/hillary-clinton/statements/byruling/false/http://www.newsweek.com/house-republicans-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-mueller-740103For these reasons, I believe there is sufficient disparity between certain media portrayal (resulting in unwarranted  positive public perceptions) and in their actual public record/persistent exposures of their failures and disregard for the public good, to fairly question any positive portrayal of these individuals and furthermore, to cast grave doubt upon their integrity.Edit: Spelling/context/tense corrections

1281	 HunterXHunter	 regready	 2018-01	 ['greed', 'greed', 'greed', 'greed']	 1514786983	 **Heavens Arena**The fact is, Gon received more Nen experience through fights, it's irrelevant how much and it's also irrelevant if he already knew the techniques - applying said techniques in an actual fight is something else entirely. That Kastro argument... not only did Gon learn through the video afterwards via Wings explanation but for pretty much the entirety of that fight [Killua](https://puu.sh/yRPoe/616992a97a.png) [had](https://puu.sh/yRPoJ/2ae76cd8c4.png) [no idea what was going on](https://puu.sh/yRPsn/a4595c9650.png). Actually getting more than one fight as experience matters a lot more than watching a fight. Are you really going to disagree with that?**Greed Island**&gt; You were watching scenes that were exclusive in the 2014 anime. **Killua lasting longer in Biskys training was not implied in the Manga.**[Really?](https://puu.sh/yRPEF/d227faeda0.png) - that by the way is Enhancement training, Gon's main strength and something that Killua, a non-Enhancer is edging out Gon in. While this next example isn't from Greed Island, it's from Bisky's training regardless and again depicts [Killua outlasting Gon in their training](https://puu.sh/yRQ8e/a82a6eab71.png) Killua's showing and growth during the game was arguably just as impressive, if not more. It's just in a different way. It's Togashi's way of showing that potential can manifest in many ways, Killua doesn't have the raw-power that Gon has, it's not as "cool" looking or as "flashy" yet the Nen masters on the field [couldn't believe their eyes on they saw.](https://puu.sh/yRR5D/16e432861a.png) While everyone was astonished by Gon's flashy brute power, Razor went on to call what Killua did as far as overall Nen skill, [the ultimate test in difficulty](https://puu.sh/yRQYt/5df50046bc.png) - Bisky is saying she didn't reach his level until her late twenties, and she was obviously strong then or logically she wouldn't bother mentioning it. That to me is a bigger growth than what Gon had in Greed Island, it's just easier to see Gon's growth because boomboom big power punch. You then take into account Killua's acquisition of his Yo-Yo's and development of his Hatsu and advanced Nen techniques that he was performing better in their training and it leads me to conclude that Killua slightly widened the gap.As for the Dodgeball game specifically, Gon's Hatsu developed wonderfully, no argument there. However, what you need to understand is that [the game was literally perfect for Gon's abilities](https://puu.sh/yRQhJ/2ee92bec0c.png) - having the time to summon so much energy was due to the rules of the game. Basically, the point I'm making is that it was a team effort. They couldn't have won without Gon, but they also couldn't of won without Killua, Hisoka and the others either. It shows more with Gon because as deduced above, the game was perfect for his abilities. **Chimera Ants**&gt;  You seem to imply that Killua removing his needle was some magical power up. No. It is him getting his shit together and finally attacking backWhat I said is that removing the needle "changed everything" - which it did. It allowed Killua to use his full power with confidence against enemies he doesn't have a guarantee win against - which is made clear by [Bisky's own deduction,](https://puu.sh/yRRL5/ac5421602a.png.) So while the removal of the needle didn't technically make him stronger or give him a "magical power up", it still allowed the readers, the audience to see what an uncapped Killua is truly capable of.  &gt; Both of them had undergone much further training and fights. Training, yes, this time they both went through the same training with Bisky unlike in Greed Island. Fights? [Absolutely not](https://puu.sh/yRRxS/43ae72c673.png) - after the Pitou encounter, he had one small encounter with Knuckle, didn't fight for a month, and then ultimately didn't even fight Shoot.&gt; Both would have killed Rammot in a whim.Right, because Gon could of effortlessly killed Rammot in a flash without even using his Hatsu. This is the same Rammot that in a weaker state tanked Ja Janken and Narukami. Sure, Gon would of been stronger in the rematch, but so was Rammot. Killua after removing that needle became an absolute beast, he was destroying whole Splatoons with ease. I don't think Gon would of done it "in a whim"&gt;Killuas Godspeed varies depending on what actions he performs when it is activated. If he is just running, it can last much longer. If he is fighting it will deplete very quickly. His Godspeed lasted half a minute when in combat. If Killua was actually trying to do damage, it would have lasted even less time.You're right. However, it's important to remember that a hot-headed Killua that didn't care and just wanted to vent burned through Godspeed in about half a minute. It was also his first time using the ability at its fullest. As seen later with his encounter with Pouf, he seemed confident that he could fight for a [more extended length of time](https://puu.sh/yRSAK/f1700d28ce.png) - he then attacked a Pouf clone again [not too long after](https://puu.sh/yRSHf/7d6febbce5.png) and then went full-speed twice, once to reach Gon, and then another to save Gon from a Nen is stronger after death Enhanced Pitou. And from that encounter with Pouf until then, he wasn't shown needing to recharge. I think it's fair to deduce that he was able to optimize the ability somewhat to last longer while using more aggressive actions.&gt; Killua would take moderate damage from the fight against the Bat and the Owl. He would also fare worse. He would fare worst, I never said otherwise, but he'd still pull through, whereas if Gon was stuck in the same bind that Killua was stuck in, it's hard to imagine him coming out alive. Also, I'm talking about hypothetical scenarios where they literally just swap places and everything else is the same, obviously we can discuss for days how Gon may have handled Killua's battle differently, but that goes the same for Killua vs the Bat and Owl. Oh, and Killua does have a ranged attack, and the actual range and size of it is [quite ridiculous](https://puu.sh/yRT8V/02d90ff593.png)&gt; Morel never saw Gons actual rage, so you cant really compare the two with him.The point I was trying to make is that it's not right to use "rage Gon" as a measure for Gon's growth in that arc because that assumes Gon will always be that emotional and fueled by that much rage. In terms of raw-power, emotion just makes Gon stronger, but Gon's not always going to have that. Regardless, by the end of Chimera Ant arc Killua has made gains in the following - Has arguably the best reaction speed through Whirlwind in the entire series, outside of probably Meruem. The kid was reacting to an instantaneous technique.- His travel speed/fighting speed is top 3- His signature ranged attack sees a humongous upgrade both in range, power and size and thus giving him more versatility.- He removed the needle and thus his base became massively upgraded, as in nothing was holding him back. - His lightning Hatsu has become so potent that it can make the second most durable known character shriek out in pain, and it can completely **disintegrate** body-parts of 1/7th a Royal Guard...and all that with less higher fighting experience with Nen and no huge vow and pledge. I guess we'll agree to disagree if you actually think that Killua didn't fly ahead in the Chimera Ant arc in terms of ability. 	
1282	 RaiBlocks	 HyperbolicSine	 2018-01	 ['merchant', 'merchant', 'merchant']	 1514786998	 There are some good responses on that thread, but I'll summarize and add my two XRB:So this is the main argument: “If an attacker succeeds to put himself between a merchant and the RaiBlocks network he can just filter the double spending payment packets, and the merchant will never know that he is receiving a double spending.”Not only are we assuming that the merchant’s network is already compromised, but also that remote networks have been compromised. Otherwise, an attacker wouldn't be able to take full control of the voting system, which this would require.Also, in this scenario, the attacker broadcasted the send transaction and spent the XRB (as this cannot be revoked). So the attacker has done the impossible and hacked the entire XRB network purely out of malicious intent, with no return. The XRB is lost in limbo.

1286	 StarWars	 [deleted]	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514787086	 Let me re-phrase what I mean. Palpatine never shows the actions to warrant needing to use deadly force to bring him in UNTIL he pulls a lightsaber on 4 Jedi.Palpatine is guilty of Conspiracy Against the State and Treason (which he states). He never presents himself as a violently dangerous criminal (I.E. someone who would pull a weapon on you). Therefore, the way the Jedi act is heavyhanded and does not represent the level of threat he represented prior to pulling his lightsaber.The Jedi literally pull weapons on a seemingly unarmed man who they suspect of being a Sith Lord and after re-watching the scene Palpatine never at any point to Anakin says the words "I am a Sith Lord" OR "I am working for the Separatists", he infers he understands the Dark Side, THAT IS IT.Seriously, watch the scene. The Jedi had no justification for immediately pulling their lightsabers on Palpatine. Its actually rather shocking the liberties the Jedi are absuing to arrest Palpatine.

1300	 DebateAnAtheist	 zugi	 2018-01	 ['jew']	 1514787444	 I'd really like to hear your thoughts on the topic. Look at the wording on that page, look up the biblical references, and do a little bit of analysis yourself. It will show you that the authors of that article think nothing of using deception to make their points.For example, they quote the predictions of Amos 9:14-15. But look one line earlier, it says "all the hills shall melt." But that's a clearly ridiculous prediction, so they opted against including that.Look at the article's conclusion: "How could anyone have predicted all these events so precisely?" The predictions are not precise at all, they are ridiculously vague! Name one nation that has survived for 2000 years without being invaded and having its people captured? Any country that's still around after so many years has been invaded, captured, and reconstituted, often multiple times. The prophecy was so vague that it could be applied to any country.Look at the so-called prophecy of Ezekiel: *I will bring my people Israel back from captivity; they will build the ruined cities again, and they will live in them. They will plant vineyards and drink the wine from them; they will plant gardens and eat their fruit. I will plant my people on their land, and they will not be pulled out again from the land which I have given them*. If I were a Jew living around 0 AD after being captured by the Romans, I'd see this as a promise that the gods would kick the Romans out and subsequently *they will not be pulled out again from the land which I have given them*. But that's not what happened, they in fact did get kicked out again and went 1900 years without a country - not "in captivity" as the prophecy foretold - before getting their land back.And just for fun, note the [Ezekiel 36:17 reference](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+36&amp;version=NIV) saying that Israel's sins are as awful as a woman having her period. The author references Ezekiel 36:16-23, but somehow failed to include that lovely little nugget.

I live in an area with a lot of old people, an I have seen a few people who are in their nineties who are fairly mobile. They may not be driving, but they will be out shopping. There are also a few synagogues and a Jewish Community Center within a few miles of my house, and I have seen events with holocaust survivors featured as speakers.	
1302	 news	 DomesticatedElephant	 2018-01	 ['holocaust']	 1514787510	 Hate speech and exchange of ideas are inherently different. Most hate speech laws are not there to ban historians from doing research, and they won't arrest professors for debating their colleagues. Hate speech is unsolicited bigotry, something which derails debate and conversation.     Your theory implies that Germany is most ignorant of the holocaust and it's danger, when the reality is the opposite. Germany has the strictest laws against nazi speech and at the same time is most aware of the nazi crimes.

There's simply no acceptable justification for having more than a single partner at once or a string of casual fuckbuddies. The only reason someone might want more than a single partner is greed, and that's no basis on which to develop public policy.

They aired things by hosts such as Sean Hannity, Neal Bortz, Michael Savage, etc.  I stopped listening because I honestly just got tired of all the logical inconsistencies, intentional misrepresentation of facts (aka "lying"), and trying to frighten and intimidate the audience into a highly partisan point of view.  Savage was the worst of the bunch.  Coast to Coast FM was actually pretty funny with its conspiracy theories and UFO/paranormal nonsense.The ads on there tend to be local businesses, mortgage services, ordinary products... and scams about trying to get people to invest in gold or sign up for a cell phone service ("Patriot Mobile") that openly donates a portion of the profits to right wing political causes.Now I typically listen to NPR, which has a leftist bent (which I often disagree with) but they air interesting news and discussion segments, including the BBC World Service.  I do this because the music stations in my area are terrible and play the same 30 songs to death.I'm actually a conservative, FWIW.

1326	 Albuquerque	 Diaryofannefrankpt2	 2018-01	 ['jewish', 'jewish']	 1514787961	 I was surprised I landed that job. I was young really awkward and looked Jewish as fuck. Real ugly Jewish actually not really I get girls kinda. The boss was this pauley from Goodfellas looking man named Nick. Always wore a suit. At the time baca was mayor and he came in the restaurant often with his cronies and Nick greeted them like he was family. All the servers were hot. They didn't really talk to us. They seemed like they really hated being there. But every once in a while during the summer a real gem would get hired and naturally seem like she was on our level. Not above us. Not better than us. We were worthy to actually shoot the shit with. The front of the house was managed by an elegant older woman who wore very nice dresses had a face that was weathered but untouched by plastic surgery. I hardly know anything about donatella Versace but that's who she reminded me of. The bartender was an older portly man who was really into photography and always wanted to photo graph the servers in his "studio". The line was full of work horse Hispanic chefs and a white head chef. There was an older woman with dark hair, big boobs who owned a jewelery store who was a regular and always tried to fuck the pizza and salad cook college guys who worked in a corner of the front of the house. Back then nicks daughter was in middle School. Now she runs the place. One time Nick got all the Cooks together standing in a line and those of us who needed a shave he sent us home to shave and to return to work. I always heard him call the restaurant his little island. After a crazy busy shift Nick always brought back a couple pitchers of beer. If you needed an advance he had no problem with that. It's a nob Hill institution. I moved away but always keep up with the local Abq news and read a story about a former worker lady who stood outside yannis and was mad about labor issues or something. Can't remember what that was all about.

1328	 TheNarutoWorld	 Sathastola	 2018-01	 ['scapegoat']	 1514787987	 *Ah a family member. He wondered why he didn't recognize him. He didn't have the same physical features that Saya and he had. Namely his hair was a different color. But that didn't mean anything. The Hozuki clan was a large presence in the village so it was easy to miss someone at family gatherings. He wondered how they were related. It consumed his thoughts that he wasn't paying a lot of attention to the conversation.**Then he realized that his cousin was using him as a scapegoat to get out of this mission. Yeah it wasn't glamorous, but as Kaito looked at the near empty mission board, there wasn't really another option. Well guess he was going to do it maybe he could convince Saya to join them.*"Yeah I can help." Kaito smiled at Kiyota, his voice still just above a whisper. "Not a lot of options today is there? Maybe the weather put people off from putting up missions." On days like this it seemed to feel like the village went quite and the normal day to day operations had ceased. Kaito turned to Saya. "Why don't you join us. Not like there is something else you could be doing." Kaito indicating to the near empty board. "If we all go it should be a lot more bearable and make it feel like the time isn't dragging on. Plus if you come I'll make you your favorite dinner tonight when we get home." He thought a bribe might help convince Saya to come along.	
1329	 Christianity	 AngelLions	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514788028	 I got linked to here so I'm going to give a reply:&gt;The Magi (wise men) were not worshippers of the true God. They were summoned by Satan in a plot to kill the Baby Jesus approximately 2 years after his birth. That's not stated by Scripture. At all.&gt;The star the Magi followed lead them to King Herod first. Stop. Matthew 2:2*Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, 2 saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.”*Nowhere does the Bible say that the star lead the wise men to Herod. The Bible says the wise men saw the star when it rose up. All they did was see it in the sky.&gt;King Herod would want the new born king of the Jews to be killed. The star leading to Jerusalem first,  is actually going out of the way. Jesus was in Bethlehem at the time, which is south of Jerusalem.Again. **Nowhere does the Bible say the star lead the men to Herod.** The Bible says the wise men saw the star and that they went to Jerusalem asking Herod where Jesus was. &gt;After the Magi met with Herod, the star led them to the house the baby Jesus was in (not a nativity scene).The Bible does say that the star lead the men to Jesus **after** they visited Herod. Matthew 2:9*After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was.*The Bible reiterated the fact that the wise men only saw the star rise. They saw it go up in the sky. It isn't said to lead them anywhere until after they talk to Herod.&gt;God intervened by a dream, to thwart satan's plot to kill Jesus. The Magi unknowingly were a part of this murder scheme. They were stopped from returning to king Herod. (Matthew Chapter 2)Your conspiracy lacks careful thought. If the star was from satan, then *satan knew where Jesus was all along*. But we know satan didn't know where Jesus was because Herod killed every boy in Bethlehem and the near by region **hoping for Jesus to be among the slaughter**. Why did satan lead the peaceful men to Jesus the first time, but then wait until those peaceful men tricked Herod to try to kill Jesus after Jesus was hidden? Furthermore, the star was **FROM GOD.** Why? *To fulfill prophecies.* Matthew 2:13-1813 Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.” 14 And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt 15 and remained there until the death of Herod. **This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, “Out of Egypt I called my son**.” 16 Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men. 17 **Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah**: 18 “A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be comforted, because they are no more.”God intentionally alerted the wise men by showing the star. Their *curiosity* lead them to Herod who then was alerted to competition. After a deal was made, God had the star lead the wise men to Jesus then alerted them of Herod's plan and caused them to trick Herod. God then alerted Joseph who then had the family flee to Egypt while Herod was searching for Jesus and while searching, was killing every 2 year old boy in Bethlehem and the region. Finally, after Herod had died, Joseph was supposed to take Jesus back, but he got spooked by another ruler and thus took Jesus to Nazareth, fulfilling yet another prophecy. **That was God's plan.** God orchestrated it so that scripture/prophecies would be fulfilled. 3 prophecies were fulfilled because of that 1 star that started it all. And lastly, satan cannot control the stars. The stars are under the control of God:Psalm 8:3When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon **and the stars, which you have set in place**,Psalm 19:1To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. **The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork**.Satan can't touch the stars. They declare God's Glory, **as scripture says**. The only thing from satan is your interpretation which clearly goes against the Word of God.

He spent most of his career as a test pilot for the Sukhoi OKB (rivalrous to Ilyushin OKB.) In 1961, Ilyushin was the subject of spurious rumors that he, rather than Yuri Gagarin, was the first cosmonaut in space; according to the conspiracy theory, his mission had gone badly, and the Soviet Union had covered it up. Ilyushin was also notable as a rugby union administrator who was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame (then known as the IRB Hall of Fame) in 2013. While being a test pilot, his excellent piloting skills caused several times failure of various computing sights and nav/attack systems, which he tested, and which didn't have a null function (Ilyushin flew so accurately, that software failed when an aircraft instrumentation measured machine zero, i.e.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ColorizedHistory/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28	
1331	 AskEurope	 halfback910	 2018-01	 ['holocaust']	 1514788154	 Ethically, I would say yes. They are equivalent in an ethical sense.Why is killing a human bad and killing a pig isn't? At least in terms of how most people view it. You're taking a life in either case.It's because the human has something else, right? They have something that makes them human. Desires, choices, etc. that make killing them worse.By enslaving someone, you destroy those things that make them human. You crush their desires, inhibit their choices, take their very time from them. You have not killed their bodies, but you have killed everything that made them human.*You killed them in your heart.* That is why I consider slavery morally equivalent to murder and Nazi Germany and any slave society as morally equivalent. It's also why I think any Holocaust apologists who say "Oh they didn't commit genocide, it was just mass slavery." are such idiots. Even if it were true (literally all evidence suggests otherwise) it doesn't fucking matter. To my mind that would be akin to arguing that shooting someone in the head once is less immoral than shooting them twice.	
1332	 conspiracy	 Nothingaddsup	 2018-01	 ['conspiracy']	 1514788170	 I think it is also important to realize that many people come here for very different types of things and they only reason they all end up here is because this sub is fairly loose with it's moderation so most things can be discussed.When I first started on this sub it was largely an old school style conspiracy thing about ufo's and the like. Now it's mostly American politics and a lot of people don't care for that.It can also be frustrating as it's hard to discuss things as the majority of users have a very hardline stance on most topics. There is very little rational discussion about anything here anymore.

If you have neo-nazis screaming about the white master race on the internet it's going to create debate. Will it be civilized debate? No. But make no mistake, that debate is necessary. &gt;Your theory implies that Germany is most ignorant of the holocaust and it's danger, when the reality is the opposite. Germany has the strictest laws against nazi speech and at the same time is most aware of the nazi crimes.My theory implies not that Germany will become ignorant of the holocaust, but that over time in the absence of freedom of speech it will become ignorant as to why it was wrong. If this trend of censoring views that they disagree with continues, they will not be able to give intelligent and well-reasoned arguments as to why the holocaust was wrong and we can never permit it to happen again. And that is when it will happen again.

Goys will pray to a white black wall. To prevent "idolatry" they will pray to God, represented on earth but eh Jewish people. Look up unescos "brown man" a statue of man in the future, faceless brown. Lots will have no past no future. No history. Own nothing. Each Jew will have 10,000 slaves. All the wealth of the world will be taken to Jerusalem. The streets will be paved with gold.  A son of the house of David (a male from the Rothschild family) will rule as king. Rabbis will be judges. Laws will be lenient for the lazy relaxed Jew, who does whatever he wants. Goys will face beheading for almost anything. They are slaves. They will work with short handled hoes in the fields for up to 20 hours a day and pray and sleep on thier spare time. The king will give industries to favored bloodlines and people, Soviet style. The best book on this is called the ultimate world order. There's companion book. It was a book a guy found in a Jewish library in Texas. It uses near-coded and sometimes open language to explain the world to come. It was meant for rabbis eyes only. He republished it, and wrote a smaller companion book where he explains and elaborates thier plan for world domination.

What if Obama never became president, would there be no deep state? You're making things too personal. You're making it about one person or another. That's not how it works, my friend. Everybody has their own motivations. People just work within the system as it exists and in many cases suits their own purposes.&gt;Mueller's investigation is a joke.Why is it a joke? Should the American people be informed about the facts of reality or not? I'm not sure what you're suggesting. What about investigation into the assassination of JFK? Is that a joke too? It's Trump that refused to release information to the public after a mandated deadline. What exactly do you want? Information to be exposed or not? In one breath you call Snowden and Assange "fucking patriots" then in the same breath champion Trump who called Snowden a traitor, Trump who withheld JFK files, Trump who appointed a Goldman Sachs flunky to head the Treasury, Trump who called Democrat Chuck Schumer to cut a deal on Obamacare against the sentiment of the more conservative of his own party. Trump is for maintaining the status quo of your rigged system.Again, you seem to make it an "us vs them" issue. You act like the presidency is responsible for the good or bad situation we as a country find ourselves in. It's not. The presidency isn't absolute. It's only occupied by a single individual. The government is much bigger than that. There are branches that are co-equal in power, and for good reason. We would do well to remember it, and why.  As for the Russian issue Trump allowed himself to be put into that situation. I suppose part of your conspiracy includes "the enemies" brainwashing Trump's son-in-law to ask to communicate with the Russians via their equipment in their embassy? The whole situation is a mess. Trump is right. It creates a "cloud" over what he's trying to do, but it's his own fault. Say what you want about Obama. He respected the system. Sure, he doesn't know what the hell he's doing like someone with actual real world business experience in a capitalist society comes to know as Trump does, but he respected the system and followed the rules. If people like Comey or McCabe are not honorable Americans, people whom peers say are first rate, people with no marks raised against them personally or professionally (which most politicians can't say), who the hell is?

It's almost New Years' here, and I'll end 2017 with an update of my Crusader Kings 2 playthrough as an incestuous Chinese dynasty for those few of you still following my text infodumps. In [the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/7mzzkl/unjerk_thread_of_december_30_2017/dry6k4w/) Emperor Zhengzong's Type A personality led to his death, and his son Ruizong came to the throne as a minor, but proved to be a great leader nevertheless.***TLDR:*** *Not much tbh, Ruizong just writes emo poetry, proves heliocentrism, and deals with a major revolt from his distant cousin, the King of Daylam.*Emperor Ruizong had several epithets, but was most famously known as "the Peasants' Friend." Despite the name, he was considered a modest, good man who cared deeply about the people - rich or poor, farmer or warrior, scholar or merchant, Chinese or Persian, Taoist or Christian, he made many efforts throughout his reign to be seen as a monarch of the people. The early years of his reign were supposedly more focused on chasing skirts, on a smaller, more sustainable scale than that of his grandfather Anzong the Lewd, but the truth of the matter is that while he was not monogamous like his father, his harem was relatively small, and he still clearly favored his sister-wife Zhou. In reality, it is likely that Ruizong made efforts to mingle with the commoners, the lower and the middle classes, and understand their perspective and concerns, and his political enemies took offense to his relatively egalitarian approach, and concocted stories that he was embracing the hedonism of his grandfather.He was also a renowned man of letters and learning, a renaissance man in every meaning of the term, and engaged with the scholars of the realm just as enthusiastically as he did the farmers and merchants. As a child, he was famous for having memorized much of the Confucian classics. His main intellectual interests were literature and astronomy. His poetry - ranging from love ballads to his sister-wife, to epics about his ancestors, to observances of everyday nature - was very popular throughout the Empire. He was supposedly so skilled a poet that there is even a legend, possibly apocryphal, that one time, instead of executing a rebel leader and bandit, he forced the man to listen to hours and hours of bad poetry, purposefully written in such a way to humiliate the man, and drove said bandit insane. Meanwhile, Ruizong also established a large observatory in the capital, and invited many of the most celebrated scientists of the day to his court to assist him in his study of the cosmos. He himself even took part in some of their experiments and observations. Most famously, he and his fellow scholars proved the heliocentric theory and published their findings in 1097, which would later be a watershed year in the history of science.Yet despite all his achievements, it seems that Ruizong was not a man at ease. Contrary to what his detractors claimed, he was in fact channeling his father Zhengzong, not his grandfather Anzong. In other words, he was also a diligent and industrious man. He lamented the daily sufferings of his people, and sometimes found politics and court intrigue difficult to deal with. As the Later Han Empire constantly grew and grew, he was presented with more and more challenges. Arguably his greatest literary achievement, and a crowning example of Later Han literature, was "the Comforting Boulder," a collection of personal poems that drew from a variety of influences ranging from classical Chinese literature to Perso-Arabic poetry to European traditions of chivalry and Indian religious hymns, tackling the theme of isolation and solitude of his tormented existence as Emperor. The book, however, was meant to - as the name suggests - be comforting, to inspire and show others that they, too, were not alone in the sufferings of this world. Eventually, as he grew older, he learned to mellow out and relax, once he realized that stress was what killed his father. He turned his interests to more relaxing, leisurely activities, such as hunting, which helped him regain some strength.It was probably for the better he learned to be more level-headed and less reckless when it came to his industriousness. A serious threat to his rule - and indeed all of Later Han as a whole - was the revolt of his distant cousin, Liu Shenquan, in the year 1099. Shenquan "the Frog," as he was known for his frog-like appearance, was the King of Daylam, and had inherited the title from his grandfather, Liang, who was the first Liu to inherit the title after the failed revolt of the Makkid Shahs who had previously held it. Unlike Liang, who was loyal to the Emperor through and through, Shenquan, while not necessarily ambitious, had no qualms about expanding his power at the expense of the central state. Though knowledgeable, Shenquan was a beefy man, feared by many for his violent temper. He was especially fond of pretty young women, and there were many horrible tales about the way he treated palace maids who he took a fancy to (though perhaps this might have been slander by his enemies). Nevertheless, Shenquan was afraid of Ruizong's attempts to limit his power. Shenquan, after all, was the most powerful of Ruizong's vassals, controlling not only a good chunk of Persia, but the frontier border with the Byzantine Empire. The revolt, which lasted over a year, was of course in Ruizong's favor. Shenquan proved a tough opponent at first, given he was after all the most powerful vassal of the realm, but he found few allies among the other lords and ladies, who had no reason to support him. Shenquen eventually suffered severe injuries in a number of battles, to the point that when he was captured and brought to Ruizong in chains, his face was so disfigured by his wounds that he wore a golden-plated mask. Shenquan could not be executed by the laws of the realm - Later Han legalities could be notoriously obtuse and complicated given it was an unholy mixture of Chinese, Persian, Arab, Turkic, Indian, Greek, Tocharian, and Tibetan customs and laws - but he was stripped of most of his titles, including the Kingdom of Daylam. Though Ruizong would have preferred to maintain direct control, he saw the need to have a powerful vassal as a buffer with the Byzantine Empire and have a more direct impact on protecting the frontier. Ruizong searched through his many hundreds of relatives, and settled on a certain Liu Zhirou, a fifteen year old boy whose father was a mere Mayor, and thus a young nobleman without many serious connections who would therefore be less likely to engage in intrigue. Zhirou was also selected because he was a deeply loyal young man, content with what he had and not a bone of ambition in his body. He was known locally for his generosity and deep virtue, even from an early age, as well as his knowledge of the Confucian classics. All in all, he was a good candidate for the King of Daylam. It was to be a good decision for Ruizong, as Zhirou proved a faithful and capable minion. For instance, he helped Ruizong slowly consolidate Later Han control over the remaining independent realms not controlled directly by the Later Han or the Byzantines.All in all, by the time he was in his thirties, Ruizong was at the helm of a prosperous, powerful state, and was beloved by the people of all classes and backgrounds. It would have to be seen whether his good fortune would last.-----Hopefully this will be a quieter reign. Anyways, happy New Year again to everyone!	
1380	 Shitstatistssay	 PygmyPieMan	 2018-01	 ['greed']	 1514789177	 Let's take an extreme example as it is easy to highlight the exploitive nature: So in a sweatshop, let's say for iphones, the workers are payed very little despite profits being quite high and their employers, managers and anyone else above them in the chain of command earning much more. In fact the CEO of Apple will earn more in a year than these workers could ever hope to earn in a lifetime. They are doomed to work for a pittance, producing wealth for those who exploit them. The market does not constrain their wages to be so small nor does it push the CEO's wage to be so high, instead it is the system which allows this and greed which makes it occur.There's also the fact of unequal power between the parties. The worker on one hand has no power when compared to those who could employ them, if they refuse to work for such a pittance they will hardly be able to get by and very possibly die. Because they have no alternative they much accept the terms of their labour being exploited. The employer on the other hand can simply find someone else who will accept the exploitive terms. Yes many people live in circumstances where the situation is not as extreme as this, however this just reduces the severity of exploitation. On some level as long as a worker either does not have as much bargaining power (say by having the opportunity to gain a skill which makes them in high demand) or the system which they participate in is not democratic but authoritative (by having bosses [instead of having all who work there have an equal say] dictate how the workplace is organised) exploitation and coercion will exist on some level.	
1381	 buildapcforme	 brando_1771	 2018-01	 ['merchant']	 1514789181	 Alrighty, so I’ve put together a nice little workstation for you. It came out to around $2018(coincidence, lol) before rebates, $1964 after. But this thing is one powerful computer. Let me walk you through what I’ve got here. For cpu, this was a little tricky. I went with a Ryzen 1800x. I couldn’t decide if the 8700k would be a better choice with its higher clock speeds and lower core count, but I eventually decided that the 8cores/16threads of the Ryzen 1800x, and it’s base clock of 3.6ghz/turbo to 4.0ghz would be the best choice for your work load. This chip is a monster. An overclocked 1700 would get you pretty similar performance, but straight out of the box this thing will be ready to go no OC required. Since we went with an 1800x, we need a cooler. So I chose one that comes packaged with an AM4 supported bracket(hard to find, as many you have to order separately). I’ve chosen a Cryorig H7 Quad Lumi, this cooler is fantastic. It’s quiet, great cooling, and it’s not hideous like most coolers. For the motherboard, I went a with a Asrock X370 Killer SLI/AC. I chose this, because a of a few reasons. First, it’s got two m.2 slots, which I figured would be useful for someone who actually has a purpose for NVMe SSDs, so there’s room to add another. It also has built in WiFi, which may or may not be useful but is generally somewhat useful. It supports up to 64gb of ram, which may also be useful as many support only up to 32gb. Another reason, was that it’s got loads of usbs in the rear, eight to be exact, one of them being a type-c. Which, if you’re someone like me and your workstation has a bunch of different usb devices, is quite useful as there’s nothing worse than trying to decide which usb you don’t need connected at the moment lol. There are some other choices on boards that would work for you, and if you’d like I can point them out, but I think for this price this is one the best. Okay so on to the ram, 32gb G.skill Ripjaws V, rated at 3000mhz, with a CAS latency of 14! This ram is blazing fast. Which is good, because Ryzen chips perform much better with high speed ram. 32gb of this stuff wasn’t cheap, about $400 which is ridiculous considering you could get it for about $300 not too long ago. G.skill is highly recommended brand for ram, and the Ripjaws V line is a great value even with the current DDR4 prices. For storage drives, I’ve selected a Toshiba P300 3tb HDD, a pretty standard drive. At $75 for 3tb, it’s good price, but if you wanted a WD Blue or a Black for the better warranty you could probably get a 2Tb for the same price. I’ve also chosen a 500gb Samsung 960 Evo, a NVMe m.2 SSD, as you requested. One of the best SSDs out there I might add. Samsung SSDs are one of the fastest, have the longest warranties, and the longest life expectancies, it’s easy to say they’re the best SSD brand out there. Okay this is getting pretty long so I’m going to try to wrap this up. For the gpu, you said you wanted 8gb of VRAM, well you got 8gb. An Evga GTX 1070ti Superclocked Black Edition. Evga is one of the best brands out there as their warranty and customer service is unmatched, and their build quality is exceptional. Great out of the box clock speeds, great cooling, lots of display ports, all around great card. Now the case. This was hard, because I was trying to imagine a case that someone wanting a build like this would find appealing. I guessed something practical, not very flashy, and built very well. I settled on the NZXT H440. This is one of the nicest cases out there, retails around $120, frequently sales at sub $100, you’re not going to find a higher quality case out there for this price. I actually just finished a build with one, and boy I was so surprised by this case. First of all, this thing is like 90% metal. Damn near everything is metal, the drive trays/cages, all the side panels, the psu shroud. It’s such a well built case, I’m pretty sure I could drop it out of a 2nd story window and it would suffer some dents but it’s structural integrity would be fine. Can’t recommend it enough. Lastly the power supply. I went with a SeaSonic Focus Plus Gold 850w. Gold rated efficiency, fully modular, a tier 1 power supply, more than enough wattage for the current build, and enough to add 2 1080tis and still have room left over. Long warranty of 10 years I believe, it’s quiet, just an excellent psu. Okay, I covered everything. I’m sorry of the length, but I had lots to cover and didn’t want to miss anything. If you have any questions, or changes you’d like to see, please don’t hesitate to ask, and I will answer them the best I can. I don’t see any way this build doesn’t exceed your expectations, and I hope you enjoy![PCPartPicker part list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/hgHs6X) / [Price breakdown by merchant](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/hgHs6X/by_merchant/)Type|Item|Price:----|:----|:----**CPU** | [AMD - Ryzen 7 1800X 3.6GHz 8-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/7qyxFT/amd-ryzen-7-1800x-36ghz-8-core-processor-yd180xbcaewof) | $349.99 @ Amazon **CPU Cooler** | [CRYORIG - H7 Quad Lumi 49.0 CFM CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/bHcMnQ/cryorig-h7-quad-lumi-490-cfm-cpu-cooler-h7-quad-lumi) | $59.84 @ OutletPC **Motherboard** | [ASRock - X370 KILLER SLI/ac ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/LgmxFT/asrock-x370-killer-sliac-atx-am4-motherboard-x370-killer-sliac) | $100.98 @ Newegg **Memory** | [G.Skill - Ripjaws V Series 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR4-3000 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/qpH48d/gskill-memory-f43000c14d32gvr) | $400.99 @ Newegg **Storage** | [Samsung - 960 EVO 500GB M.2-2280 Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Ykbkcf/samsung-960-evo-500gb-m2-2280-solid-state-drive-mz-v6e500) | $238.89 @ OutletPC **Storage** | [Toshiba - P300 3TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/QFGj4D/toshiba-internal-hard-drive-hdwd130xzsta) | $74.17 @ Amazon **Video Card** | [EVGA - GeForce GTX 1070 Ti 8GB SC GAMING ACX 3.0 Black Edition Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/jvwqqs/evga-geforce-gtx-1070-ti-8gb-sc-gaming-acx-30-black-edition-video-card-08g-p4-5671-kr) | $469.99 @ Amazon **Case** | [NZXT - H440 (Matte Black) ATX Mid Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/q4dFf7/nzxt-case-cah442wm8) | $104.99 @ SuperBiiz **Power Supply** | [SeaSonic - FOCUS Plus Gold 850W 80+ Gold Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/jWFXsY/seasonic-focus-plus-gold-850w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-ssr-850fx) | $74.99 @ Newegg **Operating System** | [Microsoft - Windows 10 Home OEM 64-bit](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/wtgPxr/microsoft-os-kw900140) | $89.89 @ OutletPC  | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* | | Total (before mail-in rebates) | $2019.72 | Mail-in rebates | -$55.00 | **Total** | **$1964.72** | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2018-01-01 01:09 EST-0500 |

I hope that one day you will get to learn to read music and pick an instrument that you love and learn how to play. It is never to late to learn. Unfortunately, music can be expensive for people like us and many, many others.I want to share this with you because I know you will appreciate what they are doing. The Mr Holland's Opus Foundation  (yes, named after the film) provides instruments for school children that  encounter similar hardships. They do so much good that I'll just link it here and let you look into it  so you can learn about their mission from their  own words.Please also watch the short film I'll also link below. It's a story about a Holocaust survivor that donated his violin to the foundation and the young girl that received the opportunity to play this violin during her time in school. It's a touching story that will probably stick with you for a long time. I cry just thinking about the impact of the gift he gave that will continue helping students for years to come.http://www.mhopus.org/about-us/http://video.newyorker.com/watch/the-new-yorker-shorts-joe-s-violinAnyone that is able to donate an instrument or funding should really consider choosing this foundation. They do such wonderful things.	
1383	 RaiTrade	 throwaway1341473465	 2018-01	 ['merchant', 'merchant', 'merchant', 'merchant']	 1514789271	 Answered here: https://www.reddit.com/r/RaiBlocks/comments/7ndi70/raiblocks_not_secure_please_explain/ds10yae/......"""This post has gotten some attention and I'd just like to compile a couple of the responses.SWIM analyzed and posted a good response in the bitcointalk forums, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1381323.9600This attack wants to 1. First control the merchant's computer or internet connection (in simple terms that the merchant is hacked), 2. Next also control all the nodes/peers in the raiblocks network so that the merchant is not able to verify the transactionBut this is not enough...The attacker wants to control raiblocks.net (again does he mean one node here? because anyone can run a different node, like https://raiblocks.club .. or does he mean attack the representative nodes? )Is the attacker a super power controlling the entire Internet? Thats what this sounds like. Its like saying the USD is also quite vulnerable to the entire online banking system being hacked and someone adding zeros onto all account balancesAlso there are several wrong ideas about Raiblocks that this "article " suggests:Quote 1) A payment to be accepted should require a vote with a minimum weight quorum. It's difficult to establish a correct quorum, &gt;and if that quorum is offline no payments will be processed.This is false. A vote takes place only if there is a fork (ie. malicious transaction.). This can happen only when the send transaction is tampered with before creation. In every instance of such a transaction. The entire network looks at it with extreme scrutiny because they generally do not exist in the system. This is clearly explained in the whitepaperQuote A payment need to be accepted by some trusted representativesAgain false.Quote RaiBlocks is just Bitcoins without the Bitcoin securing algorithmNo need to explain such stuff, XRB is not even related to bitcoin in any way, except if you look at it from an account perspective where each account can be looked as a blockchain Clearly shows you have no idea about what RaiBLocks is when you say "Raiblocks is just Bitcoin"The only thing of any substance in this article is the 52% weight of representative nodes, but that is again split in 6 different representatives and with new exchanges and merchants coming to the ecosystem, this will only reduce the weight, thus making the representatives more decentralisedOverall this is a terrible article which does not even understand the whitepaper and compares it with a bitcoin to see where the differences are. If someone is making such topics on security vulnerabilities least they can do is come up with better points to debateResponse 2This article is a bit like saying someone could hack the entire banking system with a MitM, insert funds into all his account, and this is a "vulnerability". Sure, technically speaking it is a "vulnerability" but what are the chances of hacking every possible point of entry and succeeding in that attack?This supposed attack starts with a man in the middle attack on a merchant to filter out double spends, then also attacks the peer nodes at the same time, while also controlling all the representative nodes voting power.Sounds like the attack would have to take over the entire internet.I dont think any technology can provide protection for you if your computer or internet connection is hacked. If you are receiving bitcoins from someone, but your computer has a trojan and your private keys are compromised, does bitcoin offer any protection for this? Or if you are visiting Gmail but get caught by a phishing site, should Gmail be responsible for this? Pretty far fetched and unreasonable"""

Whoever built the building decided it was cheaper to not include ensuite laundry. Well there's obviously a demand for laundry services there so someone conspired to open a laundromat and charge them 50 cents per wash. There are many ways you could write the story to make it a conspiracy but the simplest would be that the slum lords that didn't put a laundry room in the building just happen to be the same owners of the laundromat.  I duno there are many what-ifs and whatnot but I just know it that the poor are exploited in many ways and conspiracies DO happen

I mean you've still refused to acknowledge that you are blaming the party that talked about implementing it in the 90's, but was concerned about political backlash.So was the LNP.  Howard approached the AFC in the 80/90's's with the explicit purpose of designing an emissions mitigation scheme.The LNP is about 50/50 split on climate policy even now.  Acting as if having intentions is relevant in the slightest is nonsense.&gt;So where would the backlash they were fearing come from? You want to insist I'm some conspiracist trying to tie "everything" to Murdoch, but I'm actually just talking about the things he does affect.He sells papers.  His papers backed Rudd in 2007, despite the fact that Howard was almost deified by Conservatives at that point in time.  His papers lean towards decent economic management, which has overwhelmingly been the LNP since Keating was defeated.  The ALP since Keating, outside of a small period under Rudd immediately prior and during the GFC, has committed entirely to populist leftie bullshit that ignores economic reality.  &gt;All those tabloid style media outlets that were smearing Labor as being economical morons, praising the Abbott government as a potential new era in Australia.The ALP were economic morons.  Their economic profligacy was almost criminal.&gt;All this crap, used to instill an idea of complacency within the nation, unless the other side is in power, then it's the end of the world, debt is bad, until it is good again when LNP take over.Ah ok.  Tell me, who does lead this illuminati?  Is it Murdoch, or is he only on the board?&gt;Or you can listen to this last paragraph right here, and notice that my comments were addressing your concerns and explaining the position, your comment was just insulting everyone and ignoring every question I had posted to you from mine.But your paragraphs are wrong and irrelevant.

Shit didn’t go right because of the shitty media that latched onto any imagined negative thing with Hilary, while normalizing Trump. Shit didn’t go right because of Russian interference. Shit didn’t go right because of Fox News propaganda. Shit didn’t go right because of Democratic leadership that couldn’t see where her campaign was legitimately vulnerable and didn’t act on it. ( lol, why campaign in Rust Belt swing states?)Shit didn’t go right because of every “hey, this part of the campaign isn’t working” critique from *within* the party getting thrown back at Hilary supporters and Bernie primary / Hilary general voters with some smug nonsense about them being party poopers / having “unrealistic” dreams. Shit didn’t go right when the campaign thought they could dismiss anyone who brought up a Bernie Sanders talking point as a “fucking Bernie Bro, am I rite?” and then expected them to simultaneously be passionate about her campaign. I supported Bernie in the primaries. I supported Hillary after the convention. I voted for her without a second thought. I’m tired of Bernie Sanders being the fucking excuse for an outcome that was the product of many, many factors.
