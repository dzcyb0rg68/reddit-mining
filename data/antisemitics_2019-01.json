Seymour Hersh\u2019s 1991 book The Samson Option: Israel\u2019s Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy described the extreme efforts of the Kennedy Administration to force Israel to allow international inspections of its allegedly non-military nuclear reactor at Dimona, and thereby prevent its use in producing nuclear weapons.** Dangerous Liaisons: The Inside Story of the U.S.-Israeli Covert Relationship by Andrew and Leslie Cockburn appeared in the same year, and covered similar ground.\n\n&gt;**An additional major area of concern for Israeli officials may have involved the efforts of the Kennedy Administration to sharply restrict the activities of pro-Israel political lobbies.** During his 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy had met in New York City with a group of wealthy Israel advocates, led by financier Abraham Feinberg, and they had offered enormous financial support in exchange for a controlling influence in Middle Eastern policy.\n\n\n&gt;Kennedy managed to fob them off with vague assurances, but he considered the incident so troubling that the next morning he sought out journalist Charles Bartlett, one of his closest friends, and expressed his outrage that American foreign policy might fall under the control of partisans of a foreign power, promising that if he became president, he would rectify that situation.\n\n\n&gt;And indeed, once he had installed his brother Robert as Attorney General, the latter initiated a major legal effort to force pro-Israel groups to register themselves as foreign agents, which would have drastically reduced their power and influence. But after JFK\u2019s death, this project was quickly abandoned, and as part of the settlement, the leading pro-Israel lobby merely agreed to reconstitute itself as AIPAC.\n\nHere's how this Intelligence works: \n\n1- Use \"helpers\" called [Sayanim to gather Intelligence](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/487173?ec_carp=3132492668806379029) on vulnerabilities, like an unguarded motorcade.\n\n2- Find third parties easy to manipulate.\nFind some very troubled person with hard circumstance and hatred to society that can be blamed.

I was 24. She was nearly 50 years older, with a piercing voice as loud as her flaming red wig.\n\n\n&gt;**Her name was Eva Rubenstein Grant, and she was a little-known nightclub manager the morning of Nov. 24, 1963, when her brother left the apartment they shared in Dallas and blasted his way into infamy by fatally shooting Lee Harvey Oswald. It was history\u2019s first live televised murder.**\n\n&gt;...Despite their dysfunctional world, the Rubensteins kept a kosher home, observed the holidays, sent their boys to Hebrew school and attended synagogue.\n\n&gt;Ruby idolized Chicago Jewish boxing champion Barney Ross, who later described him as a \u201cwell-behaved\u201d youth. But others recall Ruby\u2019s hair-trigger temper and street brawls, especially when taunted by the non-Jews in his mixed Jewish-Italian neighborhood. Ruby\u2019s biographer, Seth Kantor, relates that as an Air Force private, Ruby once beat up a sergeant who called him \u201ca Jew bastard.\u201d\n\n&gt;...**According to evidence uncovered by the U.S. House of Representatives Assassinations Committee in the 1970s, Ruby was later linked to mobsters Carlos Marcello and Santos Traficante, who the panel considered prime suspects in a possible mob conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy.**\n\n&gt;Whatever he was doing behind the scenes, Ruby became known as a nightclub owner and at some point began attending services at Congregation Shearith Israel. Rabbi Hillel Silverman, who was the Dallas synagogue\u2019s spiritual leader from 1954 to 1964, says Ruby came to say Kaddish for his father.\n\n&gt;\u201cHe came to minyan one day with a cast on his arm,\u201d Silverman recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018Jack, what happened?\u2019 He said, \u2018In my club, somebody was very raucous, and I was the bouncer.\u2019 \u201d\n\n&gt;Silverman, now 89 and still leading High Holy Days services every year, remembers Ruby well. Once Ruby showed up at the rabbi\u2019s house with a litter of puppies and insisted the rabbi take one. When the family went to Israel one summer, Ruby looked after the dog.\n\n&gt;\u201c**The day of the assassination, we had our regular Friday night service, which became a memorial service for the president,\u201d Silverman said. \u201cJack was there. People were either irate or in tears, and Jack was neither. He came over and said, \u2018Good Shabbos, rabbi. Thank you for visiting my sister Eva in the hospital last week.\u2019 I thought that was rather peculiar.**\u201d\n\n&gt;Two days later, Silverman spoke to his Sunday morning confirmation class, expressing relief to the students that Lee Harvey Oswald was not Jewish or there might have been a \u201cpogrom\u201d in Dallas. He then switched on the radio and heard that a \u201cJack Rubenstein\u201d had killed the assassin.\n\nMeanwhile Sirhan Sirhan was easy enough to manipulate to become fixated (ironically) on some nitpicked [criticism of \"RFK's Zionism\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirhan_Sirhan):\n\n&gt;Sirhan was born in\u00a0Jerusalem\u00a0in\u00a0Mandatory Palestine\u00a0to an Arab Christian, and he attended a Lutheran school.[2][3]\u00a0In 1989, he told\u00a0David Frost, \"My only connection with Robert Kennedy was his sole support of Israel and his deliberate attempt to send those 50 [fighter jet] bombers to Israel to obviously do harm to the Palestinians.\"[4]\u00a0Some scholars believe that the assassination was the first major incident of political violence in the United States stemming from the\u00a0Arab\u2013Israeli conflict\u00a0in the Middle East.\n\n\n", "score": -2, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "WayOfTheBern", "date_year_month": "2019-01", "created_utc_converted": "2019-01-01 03:11:55", "score_overall": 9, "words": "conspiracy illuminati jewish kosher jewish jewish jew conspiracy jewish", "shared_words": "conspiracy illuminati jewish kosher jew", "socre_distint": 5}

{"author": "MMSTINGRAY", "body": "These are conservative estimates as well. Including Soviet Jewish people the estimates sometimes go as high as 9 million or more killed by the Nazis alone. It's possible even more Jewish people were killed in total too. And also it seems nothing compared to death camps but the amount who avoided the camps but had to flee o and often lost family is enough to traumatise most people. And not that any individuals life was more important than others but something that often gets overlooked is the huge amount of intellectuals and artists, including many Jewish ones, who the Nazis wiped out. Who knows what they could have contributed to culture and science.\n\nIf Hitler won the war in the East he would have wiped out basically every Jew and enslaved, deported or murdered the vast majority of the 'undesirable' ethnic groups (which for the Nazis was nearly everyone east of them). Generalplan Ost makes for scary reading.\n\nIt's also important to note that many members of the the SS and the death squads were volunteers. Also despite common myths severe punishment was rare for not carrying out atrocities. So many of these people didn't do it even out of cowardice but wanting to killing Jewish people and other 'undesirables'. \n\nSometimes people defend some of the actions of the Einnsatzgruppen as fighting partisans but often this amounted to reprisals on local communities, combined with the already racist ideology of the Nazis, and it was essentially just another excuse to murder people. On the Eastern front sometimes entire towns or villages were completely and deliberately destroyed and soldiers returned to find nothing left.\n\nEven worse is that the Einsatgruppen are just one of the worst examples but there is a bit of a 'clean wehrmacht' myth which trys to shift a lot of the blame only onto groups like the SS but the army was completely complicit in a lot of this with the examples of disobedience and resistance being extremely limited\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Wehrmacht\n\nThis is, as far as I can tell, something the far-right tries to co-opt as a recruitment tool now days.\n\nLike how the military blame is often shifted onto the most politicised elements 'unfairly' that kind of also happens with the political aspect of Germany at the time. Many Germans were aware of the horrors that were going on, and many supported it, it wasn't just the evil Nazis tricking people it was the evil Nazis getting huge support for their actions and ideology\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/feb/17/johnezard\n\nSome brave people resisted but they were too few to mount more than moral resistance. One of the most famous people is Sophie Scholl who was only 22 when the Nazis chopped her head off. She was a member of a group that published anti-nazi leaflets criticial of the Nazis, their crimes and the German people's enabling or support for such a regime. They are important not just as a reminder that there were good Germans willing to say the right thing at the risk of their own lives but also as more evidence for the widespread knowledge of Nazi horrors\n\nhttp://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/revolt/wrleaflets.html\n\nThere's  really good reasons the Nazis are remembered as particularly evil and barbaric even when compared to other evil murderous regimes that have came since. \n\nIt's something that only gets more chilling and horrific the more you learn but it's something everyone should learn about. One of the most depressing but also inspiring things I know about the Holocaust is the priest Maximillian Kolbe. He did some public resistance to the Nazis and also helped hide Jews from them in Poland. Eventually he was sent to a concentration camp. He was very vocally Christian and tried to inspire other prisoners by his example which made the guards target him even more, he'd share his food and lead prayers and the like, and when people asked him why he didnt keep his head down he said most people's job is to try and get home to their families but his is to work for the benefit of everyone. \n\n&gt;In July 1941, three prisoners appeared to have escaped from the camp; as a result, the Deputy Commander of Auschwitz ordered 10 men to be chosen to be starved to death in an underground bunker.\n\n&gt;When one of the selected men Franciszek Gajowniczek heard he was selected, he cried out \u201cMy wife! My children!\u201d At this point, Kolbe volunteered to take his place. The Nazi commander replied, \u201cWhat does this Polish pig want?\u201d Father Kolbe pointed with his hand to the condemned Franciszek Gajowniczek and repeated: \u201cI am a Catholic priest from Poland; I would like to take his place because he has a wife and children.\u201d Rather surprised, the commander accepted Kolbe in place of Gajowniczek. Gajowniczek later said:\n\n &gt;\u201cI could only thank him with my eyes. I was stunned and could hardly grasp what was going on. The immensity of it: I, the condemned, am to live and someone else willingly and voluntarily offers his life for me \u2013 a stranger. Is this some dream?\n\n&gt;I was put back into my place without having had time to say anything to Maximilian Kolbe. I was saved. And I owe to him the fact that I could tell you all this. The news quickly spread all round the camp. It was the first and the last time that such an incident happened in the whole history of Auschwitz.\u201d\n\n&gt;Franciszek Gajowniczek would miraculously survive Auschwitz, and would later be present at Kolbe\u2019s canonisation in 1971.\n\n&gt;The men were led away to the underground bunker where they were to be starved to death. It is said that in the bunker, Kolbe would lead the men in prayer and singing hymns to Mary. When the guards checked the cell, Kolbe could be seen praying in the middle. Bruno Borgowiec, a Polish prisoner who was charged with serving the prisoner later gave a report of what he saw:\n\n&gt;\u201cThe ten condemned to death went through terrible days. From the underground cell in which they were shut up there continually arose the echo of prayers and canticles. The man in charge of emptying the buckets of urine found them always empty. Thirst drove the prisoners to drink the contents. Since they had grown very weak, prayers were now only whispered. At every inspection, when almost all the others were now lying on the floor, Father Kolbe was seen kneeling or standing in the centre as he looked cheerfully in the face of the SS men.\n\n&gt;Father Kolbe never asked for anything and did not complain, rather he encouraged the others, saying that the fugitive might be found and then they would all be freed. One of the SS guards remarked: this priest is really a great man. We have never seen anyone like him\u2026\u201d\n\n&gt;After two weeks, nearly all the prisoners, except Kolbe had died due to dehydration and starvation. Because the guards wanted the cell emptied, the remaining prisoners and Kolbe were executed with a lethal injection. Those present say he calmly accepted death, lifting up his arm. His remains were unceremoniously cremated on 15 August.\n\nObviously absolutely awful and depressing but I find it also strangely resassuring that even in the most awful circumstances when all hope is really gone some people still just try to do the right thing and help others the best they can no matter the cost to themselves.

{"author": "CricketPinata", "body": "Anti-Semitism basically didn't just evaporate, post-war we had this vision that the Holocaust was so bad, that maybe people would finally reflect on where their bigotry led, but really a lot of people just got better at hiding it, and it just diffused around and was repurposed. \n\nBut people hate Jews for a lot of reasons. \n\n1. RELIGION. They believe that Jews follow a wrong or evil religion, these are usually combined with belief that Jews 'killed Jesus', or that they engage in dark practices/rituals. This is basically ridiculous because even within Christianity Jesus HAD to die, so people who were 'responsible' for his death really didn't do anything wrong, and most of the beliefs like blood libel (the claim that Jews require blood for their bread), are mostly complete fabrications, or based on misunderstandings or mistranslations of Jewish texts or beliefs. \n\n2. ECONOMIC/POLITICAL. There is a belief about Jewish 'cabals' or organized groups of Jews behind organizations of power. This belief is complicated and requires an understanding of Jewish history and how Jews ended up in certain professions. There are a lot of Jews in finance mostly because of Medieval banking laws forbid Christians from doing a lot of the things you need to do to have a bank, so Jews were forced into these careers (and demonized for it), and it became an industry where Jews were one of the main groups in it because of pressure, and people would get jobs there because it was 'safe' for Jews. Jews historically also had high rates of literacy, since it was necessary for their religious practices, so Jews found a lot of jobs are translators and advisors, and thus were often in politics, and then for entertainment especially in the US it requires an understanding of the Borscht Belt, which was a chain of Jewish hotels and clubs where Jewish performers could sharpen their talents, so when movies became a thing there was a ready and experienced pool of Jewish talent. Throughout all of this Jews either were well suited for a role because of historic pressures or happenstance, and then once they got into an industry they would be less likely to be prejudiced against other Jews who also needed work and might not be able to find work in industries without a lot of Jews. So if you look at the history of how Jews ended up in industries like Finance or politics or entertainment, it was largely a coincidence or they were forced into it. \n\n3. ANTI-ZIONISM/POLITICAL OPPOSITION. Disagreement with Israeli policies has been a big fuel that many Anti-Semites use to dress up their language with a disappropriate focus on what Israel is doing politically, or decisions they have made while in conflict with their neighbors. A lot of this will be braided in with Far-left or Far-right politics, and will be dressed up the language of Anti-colonialism and political isolation. That isn't to say that political disagreement with Isreal is only done by Anti-Semites, that is a blatant lie, but rather pragmatic and reasonable opposition to Israeli actions are presented in a reasonable political mainstream voice and are done within context of their actions. Anti-Zionism that veers towards violence and a need to 'solve the Israeli question', and excusing terrorists actions are often rooted in extremist beliefs that often co-mingle with Anti-Jewish beliefs and conspiracy theories. \n\n4. RACIAL/CULTURAL. They believe that Jews are genetically degraded, or subhuman, and by cultural sabotage try to drag down the rest of society. This is rooted in Nazi pseudo-science from the last century, and bases largely in discredited eugenics ideas about racial hierarchies. \n\nThis is just the basics, but it depends on what angle they are coming from, and they will often be mixed together, so the far-right beliefs may be mixed in with religious opposition. \n\nThis Doctor is of Palestinian heritage, and used Nazi rhetoric in her tweets, so it seems she is approaching this from a radical Islamist angle, mixed with pseudo-science.

Rense and Alex Jones are much more the former.)\n\n2) There is a significant difference between multiple Congressmen working in conjunction with a longstanding FBI investigation (at this point involving a Special Counsel, integration with the Attorneys-General of at least two states as well as cooperation from international intelligence agencies, and involving documented, incontrovertible proof of an active and ongoing effort on multiple fronts by Russian intelligence agencies to influence at least one major political party and possibly to effectively commit sedition via the compromise of a Presidential candidate and illegal attempts to influence a political campaign, as well as confirmed attempts to compromise the records system of the primary opposing political party) and, well, someone claiming (without verifiable proof of any sort) that Dubya let Al-Qaida blow up the Twin Towers so his daddy could claim the insurance money and that the truth can't get out because of teh j00s.\n\nSpecifically, there have been multiple arrests in the former, there is a dossier (compiled by a member of a British intelligence agency) that has been largely confirmed aside from some relatively minor if salacious details, there is a documented paper trail (from email records of at least three individuals involved) that point to active measures dating back to at least 2015 if not earlier, there is an established trail of evidence (in part due to witnesses and on occasion co-conspirators that have turned state's evidence) that shows a major lobbying organisation for the GOP was largely infiltrated and being used by Russian intelligence to influence politicians (something that was in fact just admitted by the NRA today), and that's just the publically available evidence and not material still under grand jury seal or FISA warrant seal.  \n\nThe evidence of Dubya letting the Twin Towers get blown up so Daddy can collect insurance...has been quite unproven, and in fact the general claims of Jewish \"conspiracies\" and \"illuminati\" are largely based on anti-Semitic canards and particularly to a forged document published during the reign of the last Russian Tsar (the infamous *Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion*) which was literally being used to justify progroms against Jewish people and which is now acknowledged as one of the earliest documented pieces of \"black propoganda\".", "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Qult_Headquarters", "date_year_month": "2019-01", "created_utc_converted": "2019-01-03 06:46:16", "score_overall": 5, "words": "conspiracy holocaust jewish illuminati jewish", "shared_words": "conspiracy holocaust jewish illuminati", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "DangerousSuccotash", "body": "&gt; Classic racist defense \n\nWrong little Jewboy, when will you learn that making claims doesn't make them true? But of course you don't care about truth, only the hypnotic power of persuasion, the substitute for truth in Jewish culture's interface with \"the nations.\"\n\nAgain, classic and actual racism hates people on account of their immutable characteristics. Being Jewish is optional. Any Jew who wishes to leave the death cult behind is welcome to join us with equal standing. \n\nThe real racists are the Jews belonging to  a religion and culture awash in racism. Virtually every Chief Rabbi Israel has ever had for Sephardim or Ashkenazim has expressed racist sentiments, as do secular revisionist zionists, as does Israeli policy, as does all Jewish \"holy\" literature. Your culture's bedrock principle is racism. But as usual these facile tactics of \"antisemitism\" to distract from the real issue. \n\n&gt; and what you just described IS ANTISEMITISM. YOU HATE JEWS! You said so in so many words with the same rhetoric that\u2019s been used for nearly a century, if not more. \n\nGood faith argumentation doesn't need to make up strawmen and tilt at windmills. All you can do is pretend my position is other than what it is and die on that hill.\n\nI do not hate Jews. I hate particular kinds of Jews who bring misery to the world - high financiers, etc. The average cattle Jew I simply pity, as much collateral to this madness as the rest of us; more in some ways.\n\n\n&gt; The reason we don\u2019t let go of the holocaust is because we were the victims.

That\u2019s your message when you argue the semantics of what happened. If you didn\u2019t have family affected by said event, Jewish or not then keep your fucking mouth shut.\n\nAgain with the strawmen. I never said that the Holocaust was the fault of, say, innocent shtetl-dwellers. It was, however, the fault of organized Jewry who demonstrably funded the Nazi party and had an explicit intent, made clear by no other than Herzl himself, to ally with nationalistic antisemitism in order to increase Jewish suffering and therefore support for Zionism and immigration to Palestine. \n\n\n&gt; The Jews talk about the Holocaust and put emphasis on it so that we don\u2019t forget what happened. Antisemitism is OUR form of racism and persecution and it\u2019s ingrained in Western society, it\u2019s just a filtered version of what you\u2019re describing.\n\nAww, crocodile tears, so cute. What's also cute is that Jews aren't content to describe racist sentiment against them as racist. They need a special word for it, a special propagandic token - for the special people. The chosen victims. \n\nAlso amusingly is that the term is itself antisemitic because it erases the semitic identities of all other semites and denies them equivalent consideration. \n\nOf course Jews extend the term disingenuously - as is their way - to include not just actual racism but criticism of Jewish religion, culture and state policy. A propaganda coup if there ever was one, a magic wand to wave away anything Jews don't like being said. The truth? Irrelevant to that mentality; is it good for the Jews? Usually not. \n\n&gt; Do you know what it\u2019s like to be considered a scapegoat for one of the most hated demographics at this point and time? To constantly have your culture and heritage under attack and contributions to society mocked? The one culture that\u2019s not allowed to have any pride and must always remain humble, yes white pride has a stigma but Jew\u2019s aren\u2019t white. We\u2019re only lumped in there to again, be a scape goat.\n\nJewish pride is promoted, white pride is not. You are dissembling and trying to impress me with your well-coached victim narrative again. In actuality the Jews were always a privileged group compared to others, throughout the entire middle ages in Europe and in the modern period. Despite occasional and minor \"pogroms,\" the Jews suffered far less from wars, serfdom, etc., than other groups. The Jewish persecution complex is an absurdity I will have no truck with. Go cry on your own wall.\n\n&gt; There is only one Jewish state in the entire world and it was created as a nation to fail. Ideally for religious purposes and as the British Empire\u2019s final solution... this pattern has been going on forever and it\u2019s sick.\n\nHaha. Cute.

{"author": "TheAJx", "body": "&gt;The writer could have been engaging in weasel wording, yes, or their point was to say that it was mostly inconsequential who committed the terrorist incident because the cities are crime-infested anyway.\n\nTheir point was irrelevant.  If I say, \"Whether the Nazis did or didn't commit the holocaust, they sure built nice highways\" . . . it is still engaging in holocaust denial.  Similarly, this is classic case of engaging in conspiracy theories - Mossad in this case - which you cede is something anti-Semites do.  Talking about tens of thousands of Mossad friends in different countries is classic anti-semitism.\n\n&gt;but it reads very much the same as Murray Rothbard's \"Right-Wing Populism\", and considering that Rothbard is 100% Jewish it strikes me as odd that there would be personal fondness between a Jew and a Jew-hater, so I feel as if this isn't an accurate depiction of reality.\n\nAre you really writing this in the same post where we talk about Bobby Fischer?  There are Jews who have participated in holocaust denial conferences.  Richard Spencer had an Asian girlfriend.  Rothbard had a clear affinity for David Duke, and seemed to completely disregard his racism and anti-semitism, per *Rightwing Populism*.  \n\n&gt;and I mostly agree with the second but I think Rockwell is too flippant with \"American hero\" and \"politically incorrect\" does not convey that Fischer described Jews as a \"filthy, lying bastard people.\"\n\nSo you think that \"Jewish questions\" are innocent, just un-PC questions worth asking?  Is talkign about \"jewish financiers\" creating the welfare state a form of jewish conspiracy-theorizing? \n\n&gt;Perhaps I am being naive, but it just doesn't ring true that these guys hate Jews.\n\nBut that wasn't the question.  The question was whether or not Ron Paul was promoting anti-semitic conspiracy theories.  You can still do that and perhaps not hate Jews.  Paul was earning almost $1M from his newsletter.  It shouldn't surprise you that he would engage in anti-semitism and conspiracy theory to make a buck and to further his political career.   He is a libertarian after all, and libertarians, such as yourself, tend to have greater sympathies for white supremacists, racists, and anti-semites than normal people.\n\n&gt;I see paleoconservatism as a worthy goal for right-libertarians who know that we aren't going to get our druthers tomorrow, so it's not as if this transformation takes much effort. However, I don't see how Ron Paul fits into the description of paleoconservatism given by Michael Foley and found on Wiki.\n\nAgain, he fits in through his association and partnerships with Lew Rockwell and Murray Rothbard.   He is no longer affiliated with them, but he was in the 80s and 90s.  Why is such a simple point lost on you?\n\n&gt;Ron Paul has, for as long as I have been aware of him, signed on to immigration restrictions (mainly because of the welfare state), decentralization of federal policy, and non-intervention in foreign policy. Ron Paul does not want controls on free trade, is not an economic nationalist, and has no desire to use the state to enforce traditional roles. Ron is a social conservative in action but not public policy. \n\nWhy are you still talking about his policy positions?  We are not questioning his policy positions.  We are questioning the rhetoric that he and his newsletter employed to build support.  Perhaps you are okay with rhetoric such as *I miss the closet. Homosexuals, not to speak of the rest of society, were far better off when social pressure forced them to hide their activities* as long as the policies are pro-gay marriage.  I don't know.  But the discussion we are having is on Ron Paul's rhetoric, not his policy positions.  I am sure you will find a way to minimize that comment as well.   \n\n&gt;So what transformation occurred? \n\nWell, he ran for Congress again in 1996 and then for President in 2008.  You said you have been familiar with Ron Paul so perhaps you were drawn to the content of his newsletters promoting McCarthy and David Duke and maligning MLK but even you would agree that it doesn't help build a national movement.\n\n&gt;When was Ron Paul an economic nationalist? Because he wasn't in 2008, 2012 or today.\n\nWe are specifically talking about the 80s and 90s.  *I don't care* what his political policy positions were.  I care about *what was in his newsletters.*  More importantly, he wasn't even a fucking Congressmen during that time period so *all* we have to go off of his newsletters.  It is also possible to be paleoconservative without adhering to *every* single one of their values. \n\n&gt;I'm criticizing Ron for putting his name on something he wasn't willing to defend and taking that criticism even further by saying that he should have suspected that his publication might attract writers that he wouldn't want to defend. \n\nHe actually *did* defend the comments in 1996.  He only denounced them much, much later.  He still defended Rothbard and Rockwell.\n\n&gt;Because your main arguments for accusing Ron Paul of anti-Semitism is to attach him to the newsletters, it is entirely germane to discuss how much responsibility he bears for what got published under his name.\n\nEven your framing minimizes the impact.  Ron Paul was earning close to $1MM a year off the newsletters bearing his name.  It was his own business.  He was described as hands-on and very much involved in producing the content and building a subscriber base, even if he didn't specifically write the material.   [He seemed to be quite familiar with the content](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/video-surfaces-ron-paul-talking-racist-newsletters-1995-earlier-knew-article-1.995876) until he decided he wasn't.  You are making it sound like someone just stamped his name on it like the newsletters are Trump steaks.  Your framing is deceptive. \n\n&gt;These aren't simple answers. Is Bush responsible for the War in Iraq? Well there are a lot of factors here, so to say Bush is \"responsible\" as if he wanted to end up in a 10+ year quagmire is not something a serious person would say or believe. \n\nPoor analogy.  We are talking about written thoughts, not complex wars.  \n\n&gt;That's precisely who I suspect authored many of the newsletters. What is the point you are intending to make?\n\nThen stop calling it \"content of unknown authorship\" when we have a pretty strong indication of the authorship.\n\n&gt; The content will be whatever it is and I adjust my previous understanding of the world accordingly.\n\nHow have you adjusted your understanding of Ron Paul?\n\n&gt;More mind-reading.\n\nOther than Ron Paul's word (which has changed over the years) and hesitation to believe something bad about him, just looking at the evidence, what does the evidence suggest?  Other than a confession on the part of Ron Paul, what evidence would actually be enough for you?  Or will you just keep moving the bar so that it's impossible to clear?\n\nRemember, the original claim was that Paul was spouting anti-semitic rhetoric.  The evidence we *have* is that it was *literally* spouted under a newsletter in his name, which earned him hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Comments which he originally defended and did not deny writing.  Somehow, in almost a decade of running the letter Paul never heard one complaint about the content and had no interest in the content.  Then Paul claimed the comments were just taken out of context.  It was only much later that his team denied authorship.  Unsavory characters were not forced upon Paul, he actively worked with them, presumably because he *liked* what they were doing for his newsletter.     \n\nThere is enough evidence to support the OP's allegation against Ron Paul.  Even at the very least, you cede that the \"moral responsibility\" is there, meaning, yes, we can attribute responsibility for the anti-semitism to Paul.   You, on the other hand, have little more than \"out of context\" and wishful thinking on your side here.\n", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "samharris", "date_year_month": "2019-01", "created_utc_converted": "2019-01-04 02:10:28", "score_overall": 13, "words": "holocaust holocaust conspiracy jewish jew jew holocaust jewish jewish jewish conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy", "shared_words": "holocaust conspiracy jewish jew", "socre_distint": 4}

After a month of this, the rabbi tried to find what the shul's official/house tradition was, and found that nobody knew, but did learn that there was one surviving founder. He quickly flew down to Florida with a representative of each faction to meet her. Coming to her bedside, they made their introduction and the standing representative piped up \"the tradition of Temple Shaarei Sheina is to stand for the Sh'ma, right?

{"author": "flipco44", "body": "This is a very good question but the answer really lies in you taking the trouble to do a lot of reading, any answer here in the comments will necessarily be abbreviated.  You can learn the outline of things by reading the Wikipedia entries on Jewish diaspora and Martin Luther.  The Wikipedia entries on the Nazi hatred of Jews is inadequate, so consult other sources as to them.  Below is my own abbreviated answer to your question.\n\nThe Jews resided in Palestine over 2000 years ago and they were conquered by the forces of ancient Rome.  The Jews twice revolted against Roman rule and lost both times.  The Romans exiled many Jews in response, and so the beginnings of what is now called the Jewish diaspora, the forced residency in lands outside their homeland (Zionism is the modern term for the desire or demand that Jews be allowed to return to their homeland).  Be aware that some Jews at that time were already living outside Palestine voluntarily, so the diaspora was not entirely forced, some Jews just wanted to seek their fortunes in other lands.\n\nYou must also understand the rise of Christianity, and for that  I recommend a book called Medieval Europe, a Short History by C. Warren Hollister - check ebay or Amazon for a cheap used copy, the book is excellent.  Christianity was spreading during the late Roman Empire and really took off after the fall of Rome.  It spread during medieval years to the areas we now know as France, Germany, England and Spain.  An Eastern Orthodox version of Christianity spread to parts of Eastern Europe and Russia.  This is all important to know because many Christians would come to view Jews as heathens and blasphemers, a people who refused to convert from their beliefs (Old Testament, Jews as chosen people, the Messiah not yet arrived) to the new and true Christian religion (Old and New testament, all true believers worthy of salvation, the Messiah came among humankind in the body and life of Jesus Christ).  This conflict could in times and places be minor (Muslim Spain tolerated a large Jewish presence for centuries) or excluding (Christian Spain exiled the Jews, England kicked them out as did other countries)  or murderous (the city of Cologne has had its Jewish population wiped out by massacre three times in history, they were murdered by the tens of thousands in Russian pogroms and elsewhere).  When Jews were permitted to live in peace at certain times and places, often oppressive conditions were placed on them (confinement in ghettos, as was once ordered to be done by no less a personage as the Pope, restriction as to ways Jews could make a living, extra taxes imposed on them and so on).  Read the Wikipedia section on Martin Luther, scroll down to the antisemitism entry, this will give you a good idea of the mindset behind why all this mistreatment occurred.  Remember too, not everyone who was Christian bought into this way of thinking, read the Wikipedia entry on Napoleon,  he was very much a friend of the Jews and forbid their mistreatment.  I should also add that the book I recommended above devotes a fair number of pages to the history of Jewish Europe and why things happened the way they did.\n\nFast forward now to the dawn of the 20th century, antisemitism exists at this time, to lesser or greater extent, just about anywhere in the world white Christians live, including the United States (see the poets T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, the industrialist Henry Ford - Hitler kept his picture by his desk -and many others).  Then, WWI happens and Germany gets beat but doesn't really feel beat, little of its territory was damaged during the war so some people begin to feel that Germany lost the war because it was betrayed.  A Jewish government minister, later murdered, signed the German surrender papers and this fueled the feeling of the country having been stabbed in the back rather than defeated in war.\n\nEnter Adolph Hitler stage right.  He was a failed Austrian painter who as a corporal in the war distinguished himself for bravery and was awarded the Iron Cross.  Hitler was not, as Luther was, a religious man, his hatred of the Jews seemed to stem from the feeling of betrayal just discussed and a perception that the Bolsheviks in Russia, Germany's eternal enemy and occupiers of land that Germany needed for its own expansion, were led by Jews (Trotsky, for instance).  So, although his hatred of the Jews stemmed from secular reasons, many Germans were disposed to share his hatred for all the religion-based reasons Luther did.  And so, there was a \"stew\" of reasons a Christian could sip from to find reasons for antisemitism, and at Hitler's urging in his mesmerizing speeches and other ways, many Germans sipped.  \n\nHitler wanted the Jews out of Europe and he had murder on his mind to get it done (though he first wanted them to be deported to Africa), and in the 1920's he kept a figure of a Jew hanging from a gallows on his desk.  Take a glance at Mein Kampf  to get a sense of this man's dark mind.  The book will also make clear how much he coveted the lands of Russia, he wanted Germany to expand to the east.  \n\nThe rest, as they say, is history.  Hitler moved east (invading Poland), France and England had treaties with Poland so they entered the war; after beating France and sending England back across the channel he invaded Russia and declared war on the U.S.  His greed did him in but for a while he was on control of areas with large Jewish populations and his SS and Wehrmacht soldiers massacred the Jews.  After the war, U.S. President Truman summed things up in approximately these words:  \"Hitler wanted too much land and he overextended himself.  He was immoral and his people backed him up.\"  I like those words, he was indeed immoral and his people did indeed back him up.  Interesting how times can change, isn't it?  Nowadays, the Germans seem to be about the most moral people on the planet and that's a good thing.\n\nSo, that's all I have for you and as I said, you've got some reading to do my friend.  But I want to commend you for asking this very important question, lots of younger people are puzzled how something like the Holocaust could happen.  I feel it is the duty of all good and reasonable people to put forward at least some effort, as you have, to learn the why's and wherefores of this most important historical event so that you someday can try, as I have, to answer the same question for others.  Good luck with your learning.  \n\n\"Nuff said.\n\nEdit: spelling\n\n\n", "score": 5, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "history", "date_year_month": "2019-01", "created_utc_converted": "2019-01-06 03:36:36", "score_overall": 10, "words": "jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jew greed jewish holocaust", "shared_words": "jewish jew greed holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "PoppinKREAM", "body": "**The President is creating a government shutdown crisis predicated on lies and racist rhetoric about illegal immigration.**\n\nAccording to the right wing think tank the CATO Institute, President Trump's administration has provided an incredibly misleading narrative about illegal immigration and crime.^[[1]](https://www.cato.org/blog/white-houses-misleading-error-ridden-narrative-immigrants-crime)\n\n&gt;But we should not tolerate the peddling of misleading statistics without context. What matters is how dangerous these subpopulations are relative to each other so the government can allocate resources to prevent the greatest number of murders possible. Thus, enforcing immigration law more harshly is an ineffective way to punish a population that is less likely to murder or commit crimes than native-born Americans. Illegal immigrants, non-citizens, and legal immigrants are less likely to be\u00a0incarcerated,\u00a0convicted, or\u00a0arrested\u00a0for crimes than native-born Americans are.\u00a0\n\nThe Washington Post compiled statistical charts that indicate the Trump administration is lying when they claim illegal immigration is a crisis. They disprove Trump's lies including immigrants flooding the border (they're not), that they bring crime (they don't), and that they're a drain on the economy (they aren't).^[[2]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/21/theres-no-immigration-crisis-and-these-charts-prove-it/?utm_term=.5a93c2cb02fa)\n\n&gt;The administration\u00a0has said\u00a0that the country is in danger of being \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by \u201cmassive increases in illegal crossings\u201d that will bring \u201chorrible crime,\u201d \u201cunbelievably great taxpayer expense\u201d and\u00a0the loss of American jobs.\n\n&gt;None of those claims are\u00a0true.\n\n&gt;...Here's what we can say in conclusion.\u00a0Current rates of illegal immigration remain extremely low by historic standards. Legal and undocumented immigrants are significantly less likely to commit most crimes than native-born citizens, making them a net benefit to public safety.\u00a0The research shows that immigrants are not taking jobs away from\u00a0U.S. natives, and their impact on wages appears to be small to nonexistent, particularly across the long term.\n\n**President Trump's rhetoric is incredibly dangerous and is reminiscent of authoritarian leaders who have committed crimes against humanity.**\n\nThe President's rhetoric - his referral to undocumented immigrants as *\"infesting\"* the United States is incredibly dangerous and it is not the first time he has alluded to white nationalist talking points.

The PROPER term is \u201canti-shemitic\u2019, and at best, is a faux word used for shaming....kinda like \u2018conspiracy theorist\u2019. Again, you lie. \n\nCainanites never passed away, and it is with whom Esau slept with - making bastard children. Why did Esau\u2019s mommy cry about not having legitimate grandchildren from Esaus\u2019s Hittite and Cainanite wives? \nYou obviously don\u2019t know the history of how the Edomite \u2018King\u2019 Herod came to power by striking a deal with the Roman preterate in order to make him \u2018king\u2019 by selling out the Christians (Judeans by blood). The reason why there were no temples then, but only synagogues, was because the Edomites began buying their way into all of the seats of power after the edict by John Hercanus, and buying up real estate. This comes to a head in 70 AD when Rome has had enough of the conniving and theft of tributary monies by the Jewish quarter (stolen via usary - interest payments and land), and the Guard finally decides to march into Jerusalem and raze the \u2018Temple\u2019 the major synagogue at the time. There is still a plaque which describes how it was changed found two years ago. This is what was meant by Paul when he stated in his epistle to the Romans: \u201c\u201cAnd the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.\u201d Romans 16:20 - Paul was explicitly stating that Rome would crush the Satanic \u201cJew\u201d............And Yahweh answered said prophecy in 70 AD, remind me again, how many got trampled that day around the temple square? It was over a million. \nAgain, you don\u2019t know history or you\u2019re willfully ignorant. \n\n\u201cScripture is spiritually written and therefore it must be spiritually discerned.\u201d With the Holy Ghost, there is no need for context, so leave off with the \u2018not in context\u2019 tripe. That methodology for argumentum, is old hat, and for novices who are still suckling milk. He that moves on to the meat of the word moves beyond \u2018context\u2019. \u2018He that hath ears to hear, let him hear...what the SPIRIT sayeth to the churches.\u201d \n\nYou desperately need a refresher in the Loeb Classical Library of Ancient works. \nFlavius Josephus in Chapter 8 of \u201cThe Jewish War\u201d states: 2.(119)\u201dFor there are three philosophical sects among the Jews (Judeans, and the Jews, he is using a general geological name, like saying \u2018American\u2019, or \u2018German\u2019). The followers of the first of which are the Pharisees; of the second, the Sadducees; and the third sect, which pretends to a severer discipline, are called Essenes. Of these three, only the Essenes are Judean by birth.\u201d\n\nYour own posting of Romans 9 shows me you have no idea what it REALLY states. It is encapsulated in your first verse quoted. Vs. 6.\n6) Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which ARE OF ( or meaning: \u201cborn\u201d, is the illusary language here, and this refers to Jacob who is renamed ISRAEL: i.e. born of Jacob-Israel) Israel: in other words, not everyone who came out of that lineage from Jacob, will be a legitimate SON. Miscegination destroys the bloodline. Just like what Esau did when he destroyed his bloodline with Cainanite women. His grandchildren, though from, and OF Jacob, through Esau, are NOT Israel, because of the death of their bloodline. The whole chapter is basically drawing the distinction between the bastards and the true heirs. \n\nEsau sold his birth RIGHT, not his inheritance. Birth Right. Think about that. Your rights are bound up in your blood by BIRTH. It NEVER had anything to do with inheritance of being a \u2018top\u2019 son. Your right by birth to continue the lineage of Adam. Birth RIGHT. Esau despised (hated) his by having children with cainanite women, thus destroying his Birth Right, by ENDING IT. Shoot, his own mother wined about it to his dad, thus forcing his dad to send Jacob away to marry his cousin, a white girl, because mommy dearest was afraid she wasn\u2019t going to get any legitimate grandkids. Yahweh\u2019s plan for Esau\u2019s house.....is to end. &gt;Because they are no longer legitimate. \n\nThose first names listed by Jacob-Israel are not, and never will be \u2018jewish\u2019. They are Adamic. There is a fundamental difference. \n\n\u2018What you believe is racist and anti-Semitic...\u2019 yep, cue the shaming attempt, as usual. Boy, you would be shocked to know that the first Pauline sanctioned church in 57 AD in Britain, was racist, and \u2018anti-cain\u2019. The Jewish (Cain) quarter INTENTIONALLY misuses the name and changes it from Yahshua/Yahweh from the Tetragrammaton into a Babylonian Talmudic version of \u2018Yeshua\u2019 in an kaballistic attempt to fool Adam.

One that you chose to completely avoid in lieu of searching my post history for things to smear me with. That tells you just as much about your ideology as it does about mine.\n\n&gt;MissionNobody is in fact an actual nazi pushing the garden variety \"immigration is a jewish plot to destroy europe\" conspiracy nonsense.\n\nI'm not a Nazi and I'm not against immigration on principle either. What I'm against is mass immigration of a new underclass that is never seriously regarded as having the potential to achieve the same cultural, social and economic ability as the native population. These people are brought here because of liberal ideological purposes and they end up either as alibi-POC to the woke urban elite, a struggling underclass or, as in the case of the Rotherham rapists, a Lumpenproletariat filled with ressentiment towards the host culture. This can all be avoided if immigrants are incentivized to assimilate to society at once instead of hauling them off to ghettos where they are used as part scapegoat, part charity case. They should be given the same responsibilities day one.\n\nI'd say that Europe is repeating the mistake it made with the Jews centuries ago. Jewish migrants were granted a very specific role in Western European society and among the Western European bourgeoisie in particular. The Jews, on many occasions, weren't allowed to own land, they weren't allowed to ply whatever trade they wished and they weren't allowed to live among the common people. Instead they were hired as [special arbiters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_Jew), they were seen as \"unclean\" enough to handle money and other taboo activities. They were pigeonholed into a specific class and a specific function as *the other* in Western European society. And of course they acted according to Marxist materialist theory to further the interest of their own in-group, as *the other*, without developing a desire or necessity for loyalty to society at large. This is what happens when you have a minority that isn't assimilated to society on ideological grounds. There is nothing innate in the Jew or the Arab that causes ethnic and religious separatism, but Western Europe has been encouraging this behavior among them for as long as they've been here. Sweden gives government grants to Islamist and ethnic separatist organizations. It's bad and of course it causes a nativist response as can be seen with how the working class abandon left parties for nationalist ones.\n\n/u/thebloodisfoul Since you haven't banned me, I assume you're not against me taking part in the discussion here in the future. I understand that I'm not in line with sub ideology and I understand that you want the subscribers to be aware of that fact, but I'm not here from some secret discord to stir up shit or \"convert\" anyone to any ideology. I've just been describing my experience as a disillusioned Marxist in a country that has been thoroughly changed for the worse by neoliberalism and left wing identity politics in my life time.\n\nHowever, I think the tag \"Nazi\" is very ill suited since I regard it as a dead, failed ideology that I have very little in common with.

The two boys are sent,  but they come across some local Christians who, as is their custom,  tried to murder them, succeeding with the one carrying the letter laying  out the matches. When the survivor arrives, nobody, not even him, has  any way of knowing which girl's bashert he is. The girls' mothers, of  course, have an opinion on the matter. The first one said, \u2018Oh,  that\u2019s  my son-in-law,\u2019 and the second one said, \u2018No, he\u2019s MY  son-in-law.\u2019 The  town called a rabbi to settle the dispute. He gave it  some thought and  he told them, \u2018If you both want the son-in-law, we\u2019ll  just cut him in  half and give each of you one half of him.\u2019 And one  woman replied, \u2018No,  that\u2019s horrible! Just give him to the other woman.\u2019  The rabbi gives a  'hmm' and looks to the other mother, who says 'no, no, I couldn't  possibly accept, we have to split him,\u201d and the rabbi declared 'THAT'S  THE TRUE MOTHER-IN-LAW!\"\n\n\u200b\n\nA man in Chelm once thought up a riddle that nobody could answer:  \u201cWhat\u2019s purple, hangs on the wall and whistles?\u201dWhen everybody gave up,  he announced the answer: a white fish.\u201cA white fish?\u201d people said. \u201cA  white fish isn\u2019t purple.\u201d\u201cNu,\u201d replied the jokester, \u201cthis white fish  was painted purple.\u201d\u201cBut hanging on a wall? Who ever heard of a white  fish that hung on a wall?\u201d\u201cAha! But this white fish was hung on the  wall.\u201d\u201cBut a white fish doesn\u2019t whistle,\u201d somebody shouted.\u201cNu, so it  doesn\u2019t whistle.\u201d\n\n\u200b\n\nIn a small village in Poland, a terrifying rumor was spreading: A  girl had been found murdered.Fearing retaliation, the Jewish community  gathered in the shul to plan whatever defensive actions were possible  under the circumstances.Just as the emergency meeting was being called  to order, in ran the  president of the synagogue, out of breath and all  excited. \u201cBrothers,\u201d  he cried out, \u201cI have wonderful news! The murdered  girl is Jewish!\u201d\n\n\u200b\n\nThree Jews who had recently converted to Christianity were having a   drink together in a posh restaurant. They started talking about the   reasons for their conversions.\u201cI converted out of love,\u201d said the first.  \u201cNot for Christianity, but  for a Christian girl. As you both know, my  wife insisted that I  convert.\u201d\u201cAnd I,\u201d said the second, \u201cI converted in  order to rise in the legal  system. You probably know that my recent  appointment as a federal judge  may have had something to do with my new  religion.\u201dThe third man spoke up: \u201cI converted because I think that the  teachings of Christianity are superior to those of Judaism.\u201d\u201cAre you  kidding?\u201d said the first man, spitting out his drink.\u201cWhat do you take  us for, a couple of goyim?\u201d\n\n\u200b\n\nA young man brings his girlfriend home to meet his parents with her  two female cousins for emotional support. As they walk in, his mother  walks over to one of them and says \"it's so nice to finally meet my  son's girlfriend.\" Later, the man and his father take her aside and ask  how she knew which one was the girlfriend. \"Her I don't like.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nA Jewish man is reading an Arab newspaper.  A friend of his, who  happened to be riding in the same subway car,  noticed this strange  phenomenon. Very upset, he approached him. \"Moshe,  have you lost your  mind? Why are you reading an Arab newspaper?\" Moshe  replied, \"I used to  read the Jewish newspaper, but what did I find? Jews  being persecuted,  Israel being attacked, Jews disappearing through  assimilation and  intermarriage, Jews living in poverty. So I switched to  the Arab  newspaper. Now what do I find? Jews own all the banks, Jews  control the  media, Jews are all rich and powerful, Jews rule the world.  The news  is so much better!\"\n\n\u200b\n\n\"I heard your shop burned down, I'm so sorry!\" \"Shh, tomorrow!\"\n\n\u200b\n\nIn the Pale of Settlement Moshe and Abram are walking down the  street,  kvetching about being too poor to eat, when they pass a church  with a  sign that reads: \u2018Convert and we\u2019ll give you ten roubles!\u2019 Moshe  looks  at Abram and says: \u2018You know what, I\u2019m going to do it,\u2019 and goes  inside.  Twenty minutes later he emerges looking solemn, his head  bowed. \u2018Well,\u2019  says Abram, \u2018did you do it? Did you get the ten  roubles?\u2019 And Moshe  looks up at him and says: \u2018Why is it you people  only ever think about  money?\u2019\n\n\u200b\n\nIn the Soviet Union, there was, as usual, a breadline. Also as usual,  before the breadline even opened the commissar announced that there  would be no bread for Jews. After the breadline opened, it as usual  became quickly apparent that there would not be enough brad, so the  commissar announced that Roma would also be barred from the line. After a  while, it was also announced that no more kulaks would be given bread.  After another few hours, it was announced that professionals would no  longer receive bread that day. So it continued for several stages until  bread was only being given the most strongly tested party loyalists,  red-scarf-wearing veterans of the Great Patriotic War. After the sun set  on the harsh winter day, the distributor, as usual, ran out of bread  and, as usual sent no small number of loyal Soviets away empty handed.  As they walked into the night, one remarked to his friend, as usual,  \"those k---s get all the luck.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nAn Orthodox, a Conservative, and a Reform rabbi are each asked whether one is supposed to say a [*brokhe*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berakhah)\n\n(blessing) over a lobster (non-[kosher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosher)  food, normally not eaten by religious Jews). The Orthodox rabbi asks,  \"What is this...'lobster'...thing?\" The Conservative rabbi doesn't know  what to say, muttering about [*responsa*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_responsa)\n\n. The Reform rabbi says, \"What's a *brokhe*?\n\n\u200b\n\nIn an Orthodox shul, the rabbi's wife is pregnant. In a Conservative  shul, the rabbi's pregnant. In a Reform shul, both the rabbi and her  wife are pregnant.\n\n\u200b\n\nWe were married by a Reform rabbi in Long Island. A *very* Reform rabbi. A Nazi.\n\n\u200b\n\nA new rabbi was installed in a Conservative shul, and quickly noticed  a problem: every time the Sh'ma came around, half the congregation  would stand and shout at the rest to get on their feet for the holiest  prayer of the liturgy and half the congregation would stay seated and  shout at the rest to sit their asses down for the most contemplative  prayer of the liturgy. After a month of this, the rabbi tried to find  what the shul's official/house tradition was, and found that nobody  knew, but did learn that there was one surviving founder. He quickly  flew down to Florida with a representative of each faction to meet her.  Coming to her bedside, they made their introduction and the standing  representative piped up \"the tradition of Temple Shaarei Sheina is to  stand for the Sh'ma, right? The founder responded \"that is not our  tradition.\" The sitting representative got excited \"then the minhag is  to set!\" The founder responded \"that is not our tradition.\" The rabbi  broke down. \"Please, ma'am, you have to tell us. It's chaos. Every time  we get to the Sh'ma, half the congregation stands and half the  congregation sits and they all just scream at each other!\" \"That is our  tradition.\"\n\nA man is rescued from a desert  island after twenty years.  The news  media, amazed at this feat of survival,  ask him to show them his home.\n\n\"How did you survive?  How did you keep sane?\" they ask him, as he  shows them around the small island.\"I had my faith.  My faith as a Jew  kept me strong. Come.\" He leads them  to a small glen, where stands an  opulent temple, made entirely from  palm fronds, coconut shells and  woven grass.  The news cameras take  pictures of everything\u00a0\u2013 even a *torah*  made from banana leaves and written in octopus ink. \"This took me five  years to complete.\"\"Amazing! And what did you do for the next fifteen  years?\"\"Come with me.\" He leads them around to the far side of the  island. There, in a shady grove, is an imposing Bauhaus temple that  looked straight out of Tel Aviv made from a concrete of the local sand.   \"This one took me another five years to complete, now come.\"\n\nHe leads them to the center of the island, where there's yet another  shul, this one build in the romanesque style using palm lumber. \"This  one took me another five years.\"\"But sir\" asks the reporter, \"Why did  you build *three* temples?\"\"This is the temple *I* attend.

First he tweeted it[3] followed by him saying this as a statement during a speech later in the day.[4] Moreover, former Trump Campaign Chairman Cory Lewandowski went on national television and dehumanized a child with Down Syndrome who had been separated from their family.[5] President Trump has peddled anti-semetic conspiracies including the conspiracy that a prominent Jew is behind the migrant caravans[6] that he claims are \"invading\" the country.[7] And Fox News has repeated extremely dangerous xenophobic rhetoric that these migrants are bringing diseases with them, they're not.[8]\n\nSome experts have compared the President's statements to Nazi propaganda.[9]\n\nSocial commentators pointed out that history has shown, particularly before and during the Holocaust, that \u201cinfest\u201d \u2014 a term almost exclusively used to describe vermin \u2014 dehumanizes a population and is often a precursor to murder or genocide.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are the problem. They don\u2019t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cThey can\u2019t win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters!\u201d\n\nOne of the most notorious anti-Semitic films produced by Nazi Germany\u2019s Ministry of Propaganda was \u201cDer ewige Jude\u201d (\u201cThe Eternal Jew\u201d), with input from propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.\n\nThe US Holocaust Memorial Museum says that \u201cOne of the film\u2019s most notorious sequences compares Jews to rats that carry contagion, flood the continent, and devour precious resources.\u201d\n\nThese xenophobic conspiracy theories are incredibly dangerous. Recently a far right conspiracist murdered 11 people in a Synagogue.[10] The murderer believed in the same xenophobic, racist conspiracies that were being peddled by members of the GOP, President Trump and the American rightwing media sphere.^[11] \n\n1.\t\u2060CATO Institute - The White House\u2019s Misleading &amp; Error Ridden Narrative on Immigrants and Crime\n\n2.\t\u2060Washington Post - There\u2019s no immigration crisis, and these charts prove it\n\n3.\t\u2060Fox News - Republican pressure intensifies to end family separations at border\n\n4.\t\u2060Fox St. Louis - Trump ramps up rhetoric: Dems want \u2018illegal immigrants\u2019 to \u2018infest our country\u2019\n\n5.\t\u2060Washington Post - \u2018Womp womp\u2019: Corey Lewandowski mocks story of child with Down syndrome separated from parents\n\n6.\t\u2060The Hill - Trump: 'I wouldn't be surprised' if Soros were paying for migrant caravan\n\n7.\t\u2060PBS - WATCH: Trump defends calling migrant caravan an \u2018invasion\u2019 ahead of midterm elections\n\n8.\t\u2060Vox - Fox News says the migrant caravan will bring disease outbreaks.

{"author": "Kugelfang52", "body": "**Part 2: And now for something completely different...Holocaust Memory**\n\nBut to the Holocaust. Isn\u2019t it something different? Separate from history? Can we really make light of it?\n\nLet\u2019s first get some kind of timeline to understand so-called \u201cHolocaust Memory.\u201d As an important point, I will be looking at the developments of Holocaust consciousness from a perspective of the United States. This doesn\u2019t really align with Monty Python, but it does with a number of other points of interest.\n\nThere was no Holocaust in popular American consciousness until the 1960s. Even then, until the airing of the *Holocaust* miniseries in 1978, the Holocaust did not resonate outside of a few specific cultural events. Notably, the publication of *The Diary of a Young Girl* (Anne Frank) in 1952\\*,\\* the Eichmann Trial in 1961 and Hannah Arendt\u2019s publication of *Eichmann in Jerusalem* in 1963, and the planned Nazi parade in Skokie, Illinois in 1977, all represent moments at which the murder of Europe\u2019s Jews came to the fore of American minds. Notable in this statement is that not even in all these events did Americans think about \u201cthe Holocaust.\u201d By that, I mean that the Holocaust is a particular way of thinking about the murder of the Jews--one in which the murder of the Jew is, to some degree, decontextualized from other nazi atrocities.This means that, on the one hand, we can say that Americans (especially non-Jewish Americans) did not talk about the Holocaust to any great degree until the late 1970s. However, Americans did, albeit to a much lesser degree than later, talk about the murder of Europe\u2019s Jews. Thus, we can think of the earlier period as a pre-history of Holocaust consciousness. A period where ideas about the murder of the Jews circulated, but did not really have a singular name or cohesion.\n\nWhat, then, did Americans talk about? Well, they seem to have understood the murder of the Jews as a single, albeit numerically significant, part of broader Nazi assaults on the people of Europe and the ideals of liberal democracies. Whenever Americans talked about the murder of the Jews, it usually came within the context of concentration camps, absurdities of Nazi racialized thought, and assaults on liberties. Most often, various Americans represented the murder of the Jews as serving a purpose beyond exterminatory racism. For example, the authors of the 1960 textbook *Story of Nations* wrote, \u201cHitler persecuted the Jews for a very practical reason; it took attention away from the serious problems that resulted from other Nazi policies.\u201d\n\nThe author of *The History of Our World* wrote in 1961 that \u201cHitler and his party leaders found the Jews a convenient scapegoat on whom to lay the blame when anything went wrong.\u201d Thus, anti-semitism was not primary to Nazi goals, but secondary as a method of maintaining power.\n\nWhy do I mention all this? Because while we might very quickly think of the Holocaust when seeing Hitler or Nazis depicted, Americans (and perhaps the British) of the 1960s and early 1970s did not. They might have thought first of totalitarianism, aggressive war, suppression of liberties, etc. This does not mean that the use of Hitler as a gag in a Monty Python did not have the power to offend, but that the offense might have been different to different people.\n\nAdditionally, it made the Nazi atrocities the \u201cproperty,\u201d so to speak, not of one victim group or another, but of all people. Since the contextualization of Nazi atrocities is that they were the planned result for all people had the Nazis won, all people threatened by Germany during WWII were victims. A kind of universalized victimhood, so to speak. Everyone was threatened with repression, concentration camps, and even murder--even if the Jews were more greatly threatened (this was often an aside or example in this type of representation).\n\n**To Be Continued...**", "score": 33, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "date_year_month": "2019-01", "created_utc_converted": "2019-01-11 20:06:40", "score_overall": 15, "words": "holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust jew jewish holocaust holocaust scapegoat holocaust", "shared_words": "holocaust jew jewish scapegoat", "socre_distint": 4}

I'll try to break it down:\n\nDue to Jewish marriage laws, Jewish people have tended to marry within their community, which makes it difficult to mingle with the rest of society as well as other religions. In Roman times, the Romans viewed Jews with a certain amount of suspicion because they did not mix with the multicultural society of other religions that mixed a little easier. Therefore Jews have always been a little seperated from main society. This makes them an easy target from the off.\n\nJewish religion requires average believers to be educated about the Torah to a greater degree than other religions need to be educated about their holy book which means that young Jews tended to have a higher level of education than their non Jew peers. This, again seperated them from society in general in a time of mass illteracy. \n\nA requirement to give a tithe of their wages to the temple also forced Jewish households into having to budget, which made Jewish families seem slightly wealthier. This was exacerbated in Medieval Europe by laws preventing Christians from lending money, leading to Jewish families becoming richer and richer. Further isolated from mainstream christian society.\n\nAll of this, plus silly Christian superstition such as blood libel and stories about Cain and Abel/Christ betrayal etc, leads to general distrust among Christians.

Seymour Hersh\u2019s 1991 book The Samson Option: Israel\u2019s Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy described the extreme efforts of the Kennedy Administration to force Israel to allow international inspections of its allegedly non-military nuclear reactor at Dimona, and thereby prevent its use in producing nuclear weapons.** Dangerous Liaisons: The Inside Story of the U.S.-Israeli Covert Relationship by Andrew and Leslie Cockburn appeared in the same year, and covered similar ground.\n\n&gt;**An additional major area of concern for Israeli officials may have involved the efforts of the Kennedy Administration to sharply restrict the activities of pro-Israel political lobbies.** During his 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy had met in New York City with a group of wealthy Israel advocates, led by financier Abraham Feinberg, and they had offered enormous financial support in exchange for a controlling influence in Middle Eastern policy.\n\n\n&gt;Kennedy managed to fob them off with vague assurances, but he considered the incident so troubling that the next morning he sought out journalist Charles Bartlett, one of his closest friends, and expressed his outrage that American foreign policy might fall under the control of partisans of a foreign power, promising that if he became president, he would rectify that situation.\n\n\n&gt;**And indeed, once he had installed his brother Robert as Attorney General, the latter initiated a major legal effort to force pro-Israel groups to register themselves as foreign agents, which would have drastically reduced their power and influence.** But after JFK\u2019s death, this project was quickly abandoned, and as part of the settlement, the leading pro-Israel lobby merely agreed to reconstitute itself as AIPAC.\n\nLee Harvey Oswald was a social misfit with tons of issues and near-divorce with his wife, so [Sayanim connections](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jamal-dajani/mossads-little-helpers_b_487173.html) with access to CIA/FBI files were able to find him as a suitable candidate for the killing and get in touch with him, playing \"ideological gatekeepers\" in convincing him to kill Kennedy for whatever reason, Oswalds reasons don't matter much, it's not hard to find an easy to manipulate Patsy. \n\nWhen Oswald got caught he was judged at risk of talking about his handlers which is why [Jack Ruby killed him](https://web.archive.org/web/20180710041833/https://forward.com/news/187793/lee-harvey-oswalds-killer-jack-ruby-came-from-stro/):\n\n&gt;Lee Harvey Oswald's Killer 'Jack Ruby' Came From Strong Jewish Background\n\n\n&gt;(JTA) \u2014 We were sharing a pastrami sandwich and pickles at the Los Angeles landmark Canter\u2019s Deli.

It was history\u2019s first live televised murder.**\n\n&gt;...Despite their dysfunctional world, the Rubensteins kept a kosher home, observed the holidays, sent their boys to Hebrew school and attended synagogue.\n\n&gt;Ruby idolized Chicago Jewish boxing champion Barney Ross, who later described him as a \u201cwell-behaved\u201d youth. But others recall Ruby\u2019s hair-trigger temper and street brawls, especially when taunted by the non-Jews in his mixed Jewish-Italian neighborhood. Ruby\u2019s biographer, Seth Kantor, relates that as an Air Force private, Ruby once beat up a sergeant who called him \u201ca Jew bastard.\u201d\n\n&gt;...**According to evidence uncovered by the U.S. House of Representatives Assassinations Committee in the 1970s, Ruby was later linked to mobsters Carlos Marcello and Santos Traficante, who the panel considered prime suspects in a possible mob conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy.**\n\n&gt;Whatever he was doing behind the scenes, Ruby became known as a nightclub owner and at some point began attending services at Congregation Shearith Israel. Rabbi Hillel Silverman, who was the Dallas synagogue\u2019s spiritual leader from 1954 to 1964, says Ruby came to say Kaddish for his father...\n\n&gt;\u201c**The day of the assassination, we had our regular Friday night service, which became a memorial service for the president,\u201d Silverman said. \u201cJack was there. People were either irate or in tears, and Jack was neither. He came over and said, \u2018Good Shabbos, rabbi.

Fischer stated that he was happy that the airliner attacks had happened, while expressing his view on United States and Israeli foreign policy, saying \"I applaud the act. Look, nobody gets ... that the US and Israel have been slaughtering the Palestinians ... for years.\"[462][463][464][465] He also said \"The horrible behavior that the US is committing all over the world ... This just shows you, that what goes around, comes around even for the United States.\"[462][463] Fischer also referenced the movie Seven Days in May and said he hoped for a military coup d'\u00e9tat in the US, \"[I hope] the country will be taken over by the military\u2014they'll close down all the synagogues, arrest all the Jews, execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders.\"[466][467] In response to Fischer's statements about 9/11, the US Chess Federation passed a motion to cancel his right to membership in the organization.[468] Fischer's right to become a member was reinstated in 2007.[469]\n\nYeah... he kind of was. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer#Antisemitism\n\n&gt;Fischer made numerous antisemitic statements and professed a general hatred for Jews since at least the early 1960s.[430][442] Jan Hein Donner wrote that at the time of Bled 1961, \"He idolized Hitler and read everything about him that he could lay his hands on. He also championed a brand of anti-semitism that could only be thought up by a mind completely cut off from reality.\"[186] Donner took Fischer to a war museum, which \"left a great impression, since [Fischer] is not an evil person, and afterwards he was more restrained in his remarks\u2014to me, at least.\"[186]\n\n&gt;From the 1980s on, Fischer's comments about Jews were a major theme in his public and private remarks.[443] He openly denied the Holocaust, and called the United States \"a farce controlled by dirty, hook-nosed, circumcised Jew bastards\".[444] Between 1999 and 2006, Fischer's primary means of communicating with the public was radio interviews. He participated in at least 34 such broadcasts, mostly with radio stations in the Philippines, but also in Hungary, Iceland, Colombia, and Russia. In 1999, he gave a radio call-in interview to a station in Budapest, Hungary, during which he described himself as the \"victim of an international Jewish conspiracy\". In another radio interview, Fischer said that it became clear to him in 1977, after reading The Secret World Government by Count Cherep-Spiridovich, that Jewish agencies were targeting him.[445] Fischer's sudden reemergence was apparently triggered when some of his belongings, which had been stored in a Pasadena, California, storage unit, were sold by the landlord, who claimed it was in response to nonpayment of rent.[446] Fischer was also upset that UBS bank had liquidated his assets and closed his account without his permission. When asked who he thought was responsible for the actions UBS had taken Fischer replied, \"There's no question that the Jew-controlled United States is behind this \u2014 that's obvious.\"[447][448]\n\n&gt;Fischer's library contained antisemitic and racist literature such as Mein Kampf, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and The White Man's Bible and Nature's Eternal Religion by Ben Klassen, founder of the World Church of the Creator.[449][450] A notebook written by Fischer contains sentiments such as \"12/13/99 It's time to start randomly killing Jews\".[451] Despite his views, Fischer remained on good terms with Jewish chess players.[452]", "score": 25, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "todayilearned", "date_year_month": "2019-01", "created_utc_converted": "2019-01-14 06:38:34", "score_overall": 8, "words": "jewish holocaust jew jewish conspiracy jewish jew jewish", "shared_words": "jewish holocaust jew conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "Klesk_vs_Xaero", "body": "In early 1944, Giovanni Preziosi - a former priest and notorious Italian antisemite - wrote to Mussolini:\n\n&gt; The first step is not that of creating a national constituent of the State, but that of eliminating the Jews. As often throughout history, the capital adversity is not that of shaping the new state of things, but that of making room for it. [\u2026] Our first central task is not the so called national unity [\u2026] but the total elimination of the Jews [including] rooting out those more or less baptized, arianized. Then push out of any vital center of the national life [\u2026] the mongrels, husbands of Jew women and anyone with a single drop of Jewish blood.\n\n\nPreziosi's argument echoed in large part (and intentionally) Hitler's own take on the Jewish question. The solution of the difficulties of the Fascist Regime during the war, the internal opposition culminating in Mussolini's removal from power in July 1943, was inextricably tied to a definitive solution of the Jewish problem. Those events had been the result of a \"Jewish conspiracy\", as Preziosi had already explained in a few contributions writted for the *Volkischer Beobachter* - Preziosi's choice of words was, again, not accidental: this private letter, with an appeal to Mussolini not to focus too much on the reorganization of the puppet *Repubblica Sociale* but to concentrate his efforts on the most urgent issue, was not supposed to remain private. \n\nPreziosi did not in fact expect a positive answer from Mussolini - Mussolini understood more or less that there was no urgent \"Jewish question\" in Italy, if only for numerical reasons, and had been already satisified with the first steps taken after September 1943 when the Jews had been downgraded to \"enemies of the State\" [*Those belonging to the Jewish race are foreigners. During war time they belong to an enemy nation* explained the manifesto of Verona, the \"founding chart\" of the new state] and subject to various measures of requisitions and concentration. \n\nThis had opened the phase of \"economical persecution\" of the Italian Jews, with the Regime focused on collecting and seizing properties large or small of the few Jews left under their control. \n\nPreziosi - who in this regard was more or less an outlier in the Italian political world, like many Nazi collaborators, and was openy despised by Mussolini - had made sure that the German authorities had been informed of his request, so that Mussolini's dismissive answer would have looked as new evidence of lack of resolve on the matter.\n\nPreziosi's plan appears to have worked, as he was placed in charge of the deportation of the Italian Jews on March 15^th 1944. He would then oversee the process up to the point where the Italian Jews were given up to the Germans. \n\nWhile Preziosi's letter is not evidence that he necessarily knew the inner workings of the Holocaust machinery, it's apparent at least that he aimed his efforts at the \"elimination of the Jews\". And that there were therefore groups within the Italian puppet Regime which operated organically (and intentionally) to the general system.\n\n\nMore broadly speaking, there was little focus on the Jews though - and the Germans were extremely private with that kind of informations (they were generally not inclined to share informations with the Italians unless they needed to), so that inquiries made by the Italian authorities were rapidly dismissed or even met with contempt and threats.\n\nConsider for instance the answer given by the German IVB4 to the RSI foreign office inquiring about one deported Jew: \n\n&gt; We do not wish to move any further with the Italian Embassy's request to make inquiries about the actual location of a Jew Taubert. It is our best advice for the Italian diplomacy never to make such requests again. We need time and hard work to attend to much more vital things for the general interest. [\u2026] We are deeply concerned that the Embassy of a fascist republic continues to employ its influence in favor of the Jews.\n\n\nThis excerpt should provide some evidence that not every group (by 1944 there was a lot of confusion within the puppet regime, and its bodies worked often in a rather uncoordinated manner, so that personal initiatives from functionaries could work in totally contrasting directions) within the Sal\u00f2 Republic had a clear picture of the fate of the deported Jews - and that there was nonetheless concern over the handling of what many continued to see as Italian citizens.\n\n\nAs for Mussolini himself - he was informed, at least in broad terms, of the German conduct of war in the Eastern territories. He did not appear to take much concern with the technical workings of the process, or with the racial cathegorizations. Consider anyways that Mussolini had met repeatedly with Hitler, that he had visited the Eastern front (albeit far from the actual front as far as I know), that the Italian forces had taken an active part in the Russian campaign in the region north-west of Stalingrad. More so, the Italians were directly involved as an occupation force in Yugoslavia, where they operated along side with the Croatian Regime and the German occupation forces. \n\nThe Italian authorities had often taken preemptive measures with the troops coming back, to avoid them spreading news of certain things they may have seen. The \"poor\" - to use a substantial understatement - treatment of the populations was certainly apparent to those who had witnessed it, as well as to the Italian leadership. \n\nMussolini, who again did not appear to pay much thought to the detalis, was keen on justifying his choice to establish the puppet regime of Sal\u00f2 with the argument that, otherwise, the Germans would have treated Italy \"ten times worse than they had treated Poland\". And the fate of Poland seemed to summarize the inhumane measures taken against the populations which had fallen under German control during the eastern campaign.\n\nAs far as Mussolini was concerned, this appeared to have been enough information on the matter.\n\n\nIt is necessary to remember that the whole pre-war Jewish population in Italy was around 50,000, against the 500,000 German ones and many more in the Eastern territories. For this reason - if it was possible for many Germans to find good excuses not to see, it was much easier for the Italian population, and for the authorities as well, to simply disregard a problem that did not affect them directly. With this in mind, the Holocaust and its details would be treated as an \"internal matter\" of Germany, on which the Italians had no saying, and on which any discussion would have been pointless or dangerous of creating further friction with an ally that was necessary for the surivival of the Italian Fascist state.\n\n\nI have taken these mostly from De Felice's *Storia degli ebrei Italiani sotto il Fascismo* and his byography of Mussolini. I would like to add that, while this should provide a more or less accurate picture of the Italian situation, it is definitly possible that there are more recent sources that I am not aware of, which may add more details or provide more evidence on those groups which participated more directly to the deportation process.\n", "score": 33, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "date_year_month": "2019-01", "created_utc_converted": "2019-01-15 09:23:40", "score_overall": 13, "words": "jew jewish jewish jewish jewish conspiracy jewish jewish holocaust jew jew jewish holocaust", "shared_words": "jew jewish conspiracy holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "jerryphoto", "body": "Don't give that site clicks please. Text below:\n\nOld stereotypes resurface among today\u2019s woke progressives.\n\nThe old anti-Semitism was mostly, but not exclusively, a tribal prejudice expressed in America up until the mid 20th century most intensely on the right. It manifested itself from the silk-stocking country club and corporation (\u201cgentlemen\u2019s agreement\u201d) to the rawer regions of the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s lunatic fringe.\n\nWhile liberals from Joe Kennedy to Gore Vidal were often openly anti-Semitic, the core of traditional anti-Semitism, as William F. Buckley once worried, was more rightist. And such fumes still arise among the alt-right extremists.\n\nYet soon a new anti-Semitism became more insidious, given that it was a leftist phenomenon among those quick to cite oppression and discrimination elsewhere. Who then could police the bigotry of the self-described anti-bigotry police?\n\nThe new form of the old bias grew most rapidly on the 1960s campus and was fueled by a number of leftist catalysts. The novel romance of the Palestinians and corresponding demonization of Israel, especially after the 1967 Six-Day War, gradually allowed former Jew-hatred to be cloaked by new rabid and often unhinged opposition to Israel. In particular, these anti-Semites fixated on Israel\u2019s misdemeanors and exaggerated them while excusing and downplaying the felonies of abhorrent and rogue nations.\n\nIndeed, evidence of the new anti-Semitism was that the Left was neutral, and even favorable, to racist, authoritarian, deadly regimes of the then Third World while singling out democratic Israel for supposed humanitarian crimes. By the late 1970s, Israelis and often by extension Jews in general were demagogued by the Left as Western white oppressors. Israel\u2019s supposed victims were romanticized abroad as exploited Middle Easterners. And by extension, Jews were similarly exploiting minorities at home.\n\nThen arose a relatively new mainstream version of Holocaust denial that deprived Jews of any special claim to historic victim status. And it was a creed common among World War II revisionists and some American minorities who were resentful that the often more successful Jews might have experienced singularly unimaginable horror in the past. The new anti-Semitism that grew up in the 1960s was certainly in part legitimized by the rise of overt African-American bigotry against Jews (and coupled by a romantic affinity for Islam). It was further nursed on old stereotypes of cold and callous Jewish ghetto storeowners (e.g., \u201cThe Pawnbroker\u201d character), and expressed boldly in the assumption that black Americans were exempt from charges of bias and hatred.\n\nAnti-Semitic blacks assumed that they could not be credibly charged with bigotry and were therefore free to say what they pleased about Jews. Indeed, by the 1970s and 1980s, anti-Semitism had become the mother\u2019s milk of a prominent post\u2013Martin Luther King Jr. black-activist leadership, well beyond Malcolm X and the Black Panthers \u2014 even though Jews had been on the forefront of the civil-rights movements and had been recognized as such by an earlier generation of liberal black leaders.\n\nSoon it became common for self-described black leaders to explain, to amplify, to contextualize, or to be unapologetic about their anti-Semitism, in both highbrow and lowbrow modes: James Baldwin (\u201cNegroes are anti-Semitic because they\u2019re anti-white\u201d), Louis Farrakhan (\u201cWhen they talk about Farrakhan, call me a hater, you know what they do, call me an anti-Semite. Stop it. I am anti-termite. The Jews don\u2019t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that\u2019s a great name. Hitler was a very great man\u201d), Jesse Jackson (\u201cHymietown\u201d), Al Sharpton (\u201cIf the Jews want to get it on, tell them to pin their yarmulkes back and come over to my house\u201d), and the Reverend Jeremiah Wright (\u201cThe Jews ain\u2019t gonna let him [Obama] talk to me\u201d).\n\nNote that Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton both ran as Democratic candidates for president. Sharpton officially visited the Obama White House more than 100 times, and Wright was the Obamas\u2019 longtime personal pastor who officiated at the couple\u2019s wedding and the baptism of their daughters and inspired the title of Obama\u2019s second book.\n\nIn the past ten years, however, we have seen an emerging new, new anti-Semitism. It is likely to become far more pernicious than both the old-right and new-left versions, because it is not just an insidiously progressive phenomenon. It has also become deeply embedded in popular culture and is now rebranded with acceptable cool among America\u2019s historically ignorant youth. In particular, the new, new bigotry is \u201cintersectional.\u201d It serves as a unifying progressive bond among \u201cmarginalized\u201d groups such as young Middle Easterners, Muslims, feminists, blacks, woke celebrities and entertainers, socialists, the \u201cundocumented,\u201d and student activists. Abroad, the new, new bigotry is fueled by British Labourites and anti-Israel EU grandees.\n\nOf course, the new, new anti-Semitism\u2019s overt messages derive from both the old and the new. There is the same conspiratorial idea that the Jews covertly and underhandedly exert inordinate control over Americans (perhaps now as grasping sports-franchise owners or greedy hip-hop record executives). But the new, new anti-Semitism has added a number of subtler twists, namely that Jews are part of the old guard whose anachronistic standards of privilege block the emerging new constituency of woke Muslims, blacks, Latinos, and feminists.\n\nWithin the Democratic party, such animus is manifested by young woke politicians facing an old white hierarchy. Progressive activist Linda Sarsour oddly singled out for censure Senate majority leader Charles Schumer, saying, \u201cI\u2019m talking to Chuck Schumer. I\u2019m tired of white men negotiating on the backs of people of color and communities like ours.\u201d\n\nIn attacking Schumer, ostensibly a fellow progressive, Sarsour is claiming an intersectional bond forged in mutual victimization by whites \u2014 and thus older liberal Jews apparently either cannot conceive of such victimization or in fact are party to it. With a brief tweet, Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez dismissed former Democratic senator Joe Lieberman\u2019s worry over the current leftward drift of the new Democratic party. \u201cNew party, who dis?\u201d she mocked, apparently suggesting that the 76-year-old former Democratic vice-presidential candidate was irrelevant to the point of nonexistence for the new progressive generation.\n\nLikewise, the generic invective against Trump \u2014 perhaps the most pro-Israel and pro-Jewish president of the modern era \u2014 as an anti-Semite and racist provides additional cover. Hating the supposedly Jew-hating Trump implies that you are not a Jew-hater yourself.\n\nRap and hip-hop music now routinely incorporate anti-Semitic lyrics and themes of Jews as oppressors \u2014 note the lyrics of rappers such as Malice, Pusha T, The Clipse, Ghostface Killah, Gunplay, Ice Cube, Jay-Z, Mos Def, and Scarface. More recently, LeBron James, the Los Angeles Lakers basketball legend, tweeted out the anti-Semitic lyrics of rapper 21 Savage: \u201cWe been getting that Jewish money, everything is Kosher.\u201d LeBron was puzzled about why anyone would take offense, much less question him, a deified figure. He has a point, given that singling out Jews as money-grubbers, cheats, and conspirators has become a sort of rap brand, integral to the notion of the rapper as Everyman\u2019s pushback against the universal oppressor. The music executive and franchise owner is the new Pawnbroker, and his demonization is often cast as no big deal at best and at worst as a sort of legitimate cry of the heart from the oppressed.\n\nNote that marquee black leaders \u2014 from Keith Ellison to Barack Obama to the grandees of the Congressional Black Caucus \u2014 have all had smiling photo-ops with the anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan, a contemporary black version of Richard Spencer or the 1980s David Duke. Appearing with Farrakhan, however, never became toxic, even after he once publicly warned Jews, \u201cAnd don\u2019t you forget, when it\u2019s God who puts you in the ovens, it\u2019s forever!\u201d\n\n", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "justapartheidthings", "date_year_month": "2019-01", "created_utc_converted": "2019-01-16 15:31:55", "score_overall": 8, "words": "jew holocaust jewish jewish jew jew jewish kosher", "shared_words": "jew holocaust jewish kosher", "socre_distint": 4}
{"author": "Elias19990", "body": "part1 \n\nOn page 515 of Ibn Ishaq's \"Sirat Rasulallah\", (The Life of the Prophet of God), the events of the conquest of Khaibar are detailed.\n\npage 515 reads:\n\n\"Kinana al-Rabi, who had the custody of the treasure of Banu Nadir, was brought to the apostle who asked him about it. He denied that he knew where it was. A Jew came (Tabari says \"was brought\"), to the apostle and said that he had seen Kinana going round a certain ruin every morning early. When the apostle said to Kinana, \"Do you know that if we find you have it I shall kill you?\" He said \"Yes\". The apostle gave orders that the ruin was to be excavated and some of the treasure was found. When he asked him about the rest he refused to produce it, so the apostle gave orders to al-Zubayr Al-Awwam, \"Torture him until you extract what he has.\" So he kindled a fire with flint and steel on his chest until he was nearly dead. Then the apostle delivered him to Muhammad b. Maslama and he struck off his head, in revenge for his brother Mahmud.\"\n\nMany might find Muhammad's orders to torture Kinana to obtain \"buried treasure\" similar to what criminals do to obtain people's money or possessions. It is not difficult to picture organized crime figures beating some one or torturing them to make them talk. \"Talk!, tell us where the money is!, or we'll make your pain even worse!\". Finally, when he is near death, Muhammad has his head cut off. It appears that Muhammad's greed drove him to torture and then murder, for the sole purpose to obtain money.\n\nThink about Muhammad's statement, \"Torture him until you extract what he has\". This is the prophet of Islam in action when he now has the power of the sword with no threat of external consequence. What kind of a man is this prophet of Islam, and what does this say about the people who choose to follow him, as all who do must also choose to justify and support all his deeds. Millions have gone to their death unwilling to risk their eternity on the man, but an even greater number have hitched their wagons to his destiny. It's an age-old dilemma and choice still being forced on many throughout the world today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom Guillaume, op cit, page 369:\n\n\"The apostle said, \"Kill any Jew that falls into your power.\" Thereupon Muhayyisa b. Masud leapt upon Ibn Sunayna, a Jewish merchant with whom they had social and business relations, and killed him. Huwayyisa was not a Muslim at the time though he was the elder brother. When Muhayyisa killed him Huwayyisa began to beat him, saying, 'You enemy of God, did you kill him when much of the fat on your belly comes from his wealth?' Muhayyisa answered, 'Had the one who ordered me to kill him ordered me to kill you I would have cut your head off.'\"\n\nThis story is also supported in the Sunan of Abu Dawud Book 19, Number 2996:\n\nNarrated Muhayyisah: The Apostle of Allah said: If you gain a victory over the men of Jews, kill them. So Muhayyisah jumped over Shubaybah, a man of the Jewish merchants. He had close relations with them. He then killed him. At that time Huwayyisah (brother of Muhayyisah) had not embraced Islam. He was older than Muhayyisah. When he killed him, Huwayyisah beat him and said: O enemy of Allah, I swear by Allah, you have a good deal of fat in your belly from his property.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImams. scholars and people like Ali Dawah and Mohammed Hijab praise and defend actions like these- you should as well.

What matters is how dangerous these subpopulations are relative to each other so the government can allocate resources to prevent the greatest number of murders possible. Thus, enforcing immigration law more harshly is an ineffective way to punish a population that is less likely to murder or commit crimes than native-born Americans. Illegal immigrants, non-citizens, and legal immigrants are less likely to be\u00a0incarcerated,\u00a0convicted, or\u00a0arrested\u00a0for crimes than native-born Americans are.\u00a0\n\nThe Washington Post compiled statistical charts that indicate the Trump administration is lying when they claim illegal immigration is a crisis. They disprove Trump's lies including immigrants flooding the border (they're not), that they bring crime (they don't), and that they're a drain on the economy (they aren't).^[[2]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/21/theres-no-immigration-crisis-and-these-charts-prove-it/?utm_term=.5a93c2cb02fa)\n\n&gt;The administration\u00a0has said\u00a0that the country is in danger of being \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by \u201cmassive increases in illegal crossings\u201d that will bring \u201chorrible crime,\u201d \u201cunbelievably great taxpayer expense\u201d and\u00a0the loss of American jobs.\n\n&gt;None of those claims are\u00a0true.\n\n&gt;...Here's what we can say in conclusion.\u00a0Current rates of illegal immigration remain extremely low by historic standards. Legal and undocumented immigrants are significantly less likely to commit most crimes than native-born citizens, making them a net benefit to public safety.\u00a0The research shows that immigrants are not taking jobs away from\u00a0U.S. natives, and their impact on wages appears to be small to nonexistent, particularly across the long term.\n\n**President Trump's rhetoric is incredibly dangerous and is reminiscent of authoritarian leaders who have committed crimes against humanity.**\n\nThe President's rhetoric - his referral to undocumented immigrants as *\"infesting\"* the United States is incredibly dangerous and it is not the first time he has alluded to white nationalist talking points.

Not the people, not Judaism itself. The left doesn\u2019t generally stake out the position of, ALL JEWS NEED TO DIE AND THAT MEANS ISRAEL NEEDS TO BE EXTERMINATED. However this is basically true among the antisemitic non-religious right.\nOn the right, anti-Semites can be broken up into two basic groups: \n\n1.\tThe religious right. Christians, the religious right who \"care\" about Jews in the sense they want Israel to be in their hands, so when jesus returns and the rapture happens, they can ascend to heaven and Jews will be left to rot on the earthen hellscape. Oh and those who die will be burning in hell for eternity. But they, they consider themselves \u201cfriends\u201d of the Jewish people.

They want Jews dead, exterminated, eradicated. The MAGAbomber was antisemitic, and the synagogue shooter as well. Both also believed in Qanon. Qanon is virulently antisemitic (jews control the planet, globalism, etc) and we see countless images of Trump supporters at the hate rallies holding Qanon signs, wearing the shirts, chanting WWG1WGA.

Not the \"we think Israel should relax its policies\" hatred, but instead the \"Israel should be nuked and jews should be exterminated\" type of hatred. \n\nThese two groups are fully supported by the Trump administration.

Or try Helmuth H\u00fcbener\u2014 seventeen-year-old boy, executed by beheading for passing out pamphlets.\n\nSachsenhausen is also near Berlin, which has quite a lot of memorials showing what the SS and Gestapo did, the effects of Aktion T4, etc. They've got documents, photographs, etc. \n\n&gt; Trial? Carried out by whom? What were the rules of evidence? Was he tortured?\n\nAdolf Eichmann was captured in Argentina by Mossad, decades after the end of the war, and tried in Israel with a panel of multiple judges. There is no evidence that I can find of his being tortured, and extradition to Israel took only nine days. Eichmann was responsible for the assembly and deportation of Jews during the Final Solution. His mannerisms led to the coining of the phrase \"the banality of evil\", since he continuously insisted that he was \"just following orders\". His trial lasted from April to December of 1961, and he was hanged in spring of 1962. His trial included the testimonies of several Holocaust survivors and former Nazis, documents showing his deportation plans for Roma and Jews as well as how he planned to seize their property, charges of being part of the *Sturmabteilung* and *Sicherheitsdienst* (two criminal organizations), and collaboration with the head of the Gestapo. Eichmann was kept behind glass to keep him safe. He said during his trial that although he was responsible for sending millions of Jews to their deaths, he did not feel guilty. Additionally, he had said that if he had to kill himself at the end of the war, he would \"leap into [his] grave happy because we will at least have wiped out Europe\u2019s Jews.\"\n\n&gt; Those are religions, not races.\n\nJudaism is a religion. There are ethnic Jews, yes, but Judaism is most certainly a religion.\n\n&gt; I'm impressed that you even know about the Tanakh. Bravo. Look, I can see you are far better informed than most but that doesn't mean you've really been allowed to form your own opinions based on all the evidence. Because you are only shown one side of things.\n\nOf course I know of the Tanakh. I've read it and studied some of the Hebrew. And most of my research ends up being independent. Schools certainly don't teach the eugenics movement, much less how much we contributed to Nazi Germany's laws. I've read accounts of camp survivors, Lebensborn victims, German and Polish resistance fighters, Russian partisans, American soldiers and ambassadors, Hitler himself, and yes, even modern neo-Nazis and Holocaust denialists. I have seen multiple facets. I just don't agree with you. \n\n&gt; The ones who use the media to propagate some notion of Whites in a conspiracy? The ones that say Whites are \"over represented\" (in a country they created!) while Jews themselves are PROVABLY over-represented in the media and other areas. \n\nWhat they created, as you put it (which ignores the native tribes already here), has no bearing on current population sizes. And by overrepresentation, they generally refer to instances like Congress. White people make up [76ish percent](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045217) *if* you count some Latinos and Hispanics in that number, otherwise it's significantly lower. And yet Congress has under [20 percent of members as women or minorities](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/slideshows/the-115th-congress-by-party-race-gender-and-religion). This isn't even mentioning the religious gap, since 90 percent of Congress members identified as Christian despite Christians making up [70 percent](http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/) of the population. \n\n&gt; Have you gone to a grocery store lately? Start paying attention to how many things are \"Kosher\" now. Nearly everything. \n\nKinda how supply and demand works. If you're the one store in town that's got halal meat or kosher food or vegan products, then you're going to get those customers. Those sections are often small where I'm at, far smaller than Asian or Hispanic food sections, and smaller even than the British food section.\n\n&gt; Imagine Catholics shaking down entire industries for protection money like that. It would be far more justified since there are more Catholics here. Why are we all paying to have some product \"Kosher\" when it is only a tiny minority OF a tiny minority which adheres to it?\n\nThe Catholic Church is already insanely rich and gets money on at least a weekly basis that goes God knows where at this point. \n\nAnd no one's making you buy kosher products.\n\n&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNKoq2PPKdU\n\nI want a list of this guy's sources. I'm not immediately inclined to trust YouTube videos unless they're from a verified source, and this one is certainly not that.\n\n&gt; They are not primary sources, are they? Not trying to be a wise ass. I just think you are putting way too much stock in those sources that more based on opinion than you think.\n\nThe ones I gave you included multiple first-hand accounts and pictures. Also, there is certainly value to secondary sources, which a single moment doing an OPCVL chart can teach you.

{"author": "RogueHammer", "body": "If you still don't think he is a racist after all this time I'm not sure any evidence could possibly change you mind, but just in case;\n\n\n**The President is creating a government shutdown crisis predicated on lies and racist rhetoric about illegal immigration.**\n\nAccording to the right wing think tank the CATO Institute, President Trump's administration has provided an incredibly misleading narrative about illegal immigration and crime.^[[1]](https://www.cato.org/blog/white-houses-misleading-error-ridden-narrative-immigrants-crime)\n\n&gt;But we should not tolerate the peddling of misleading statistics without context. What matters is how dangerous these subpopulations are relative to each other so the government can allocate resources to prevent the greatest number of murders possible. Thus, enforcing immigration law more harshly is an ineffective way to punish a population that is less likely to murder or commit crimes than native-born Americans. Illegal immigrants, non-citizens, and legal immigrants are less likely to be\u00a0incarcerated,\u00a0convicted, or\u00a0arrested\u00a0for crimes than native-born Americans are.\u00a0\n\nThe Washington Post compiled statistical charts that indicate the Trump administration is lying when they claim illegal immigration is a crisis. They disprove Trump's lies including immigrants flooding the border (they're not), that they bring crime (they don't), and that they're a drain on the economy (they aren't).^[[2]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/21/theres-no-immigration-crisis-and-these-charts-prove-it/?utm_term=.5a93c2cb02fa)\n\n&gt;The administration\u00a0has said\u00a0that the country is in danger of being \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by \u201cmassive increases in illegal crossings\u201d that will bring \u201chorrible crime,\u201d \u201cunbelievably great taxpayer expense\u201d and\u00a0the loss of American jobs.\n\n&gt;None of those claims are\u00a0true.\n\n&gt;...Here's what we can say in conclusion.\u00a0Current rates of illegal immigration remain extremely low by historic standards. Legal and undocumented immigrants are significantly less likely to commit most crimes than native-born citizens, making them a net benefit to public safety.\u00a0The research shows that immigrants are not taking jobs away from\u00a0U.S. natives, and their impact on wages appears to be small to nonexistent, particularly across the long term.\n\n**President Trump's rhetoric is incredibly dangerous and is reminiscent of authoritarian leaders who have committed crimes against humanity.**\n\nThe President's rhetoric - his referral to undocumented immigrants as *\"infesting\"* the United States is incredibly dangerous and it is not the first time he has alluded to white nationalist talking points. First he tweeted it^[[3]](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/06/19/republican-pressure-intensifies-to-end-family-separations-at-border.html) followed by him saying this as a statement during a speech later in the day.^[[4]](http://fox2now.com/2018/06/19/trump-ramps-up-rhetoric-dems-want-illegal-immigrants-to-infest-our-country/) Moreover, former Trump Campaign Chairman Cory Lewandowski went on national television and dehumanized a child with Down Syndrome who had been separated from their family.^[[5]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/06/20/womp-womp-outrage-after-corey-lewandowski-mocks-story-of-child-with-down-syndrome-separated-from-parents/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.18f884832b12) President Trump has peddled anti-semetic conspiracies including the conspiracy that a prominent Jew is behind the migrant caravans^[[6]](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/414171-trump-i-wouldnt-be-surprised-if-soros-were-paying-for-migrant-caravan) that he claims are *\"invading\"* the country.^[[7]](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-trump-defends-calling-migrant-caravan-an-invasion-ahead-of-midterm-elections) And Fox News has repeated extremely dangerous xenophobic rhetoric that these migrants are bringing diseases with them, they're not.^[[8]](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/11/1/18048332/migrant-caravan-fox-news-disease-smallpox-outbreaks-vaccines-xenophobia)\n\nSome experts have compared the President's statements to Nazi propaganda.^[[9]](https://www.timesofisrael.com/critics-say-trumps-description-of-immigrants-recalls-nazi-propaganda/)\n\n&gt;Social commentators pointed out that history has shown, particularly before and during the Holocaust, that \u201cinfest\u201d \u2014 a term almost exclusively used to describe vermin \u2014 dehumanizes a population and is often a precursor to murder or genocide.\n\n&gt;\u201cDemocrats are the problem.

{"author": "Schaden_FREUD_e", "body": "&gt; Cultural Marxism is the undermining of Western values by promoting anti-Western cultural values. That is the best way I can describe it. It brings to mind an article that Jewish Quarterly took down that admits how Jews promote porn for this reason.\n\nYou know there's a such thing as Western Marxism, right? Also, we learned about this in school as well: Marx's take on religion, for instance, goes against modern, Western, secular values just as saying America is a Christian nation does.\n\nI also couldn't care less about the porn industry. Get off on whatever you want as long as it's legal.\n\n&gt; Once again, we see how the detractors have it right. But people who are conditioned as you are have trouble facing it even when it is openly admitted. Don't you find that troubling. Jumping ahead, it is funny how you see the ADL as opposing Ford and others. As if that is a good thing? Why not see Ford and others (many great men warned us about Jews...I guess they are all just wrong, eh?) as opposing Jews and THAT being a good thing. Who is warping your perceptions that way?\n\nI covered Ford, Coughlin, the Bund, etc. in my thesis. Coughlin praised *Kristallnacht* and inspired the Christian Front, which in turn praised Hitler and Franco as well as allying itself with the Bund. Ford was praised in *Mein Kampf* and based many of his articles on the fabricated text *The Protocols of the Elders of Zion*. What, exactly, should I be lauding there?\n\n&gt; You speak of not answering questions. I asked what the equivalent of Hillel would be for White people. You deflect. Hillel is race-based. Not religion. Just like Israel is. MOST Jews in Israel are atheists. Are they being removed? This is why you end up with absurdities like \"Sam Harris\" who is transparently a Jew, claiming to be an atheist yet....supporting Israel. Something isn't adding up there.\n\nHillel was founded by a guy who was worried about his students' lack of knowledge on the religious texts, and their site references spirituality and Judaism multiple times. There are also plenty of race-based college groups in the US, to the point where I have to ask... are you really unaware of them?\n\nFirst of all, Israel is [majority Jewish by a vast percentage.](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-major-religions-in-israel.html) Second of all, Sam Harris is an atheist. He's just also heavily biased. He's anti-Middle-East, which... it's fine to oppose the actions of some of the people there, but of course he's skewed toward Israel over other nations in the area.\n\n&gt; But not the genocide of Palestinians. Pretty disingenuous.\n\nThey haven't mentioned every genocide, no. That'd take quite some time. They didn't mention the Rohingya or the Rwandan genocide either. You're talking an event from 1948, and they mentioned ones clustered in the mid- to late 90s and the early 2000s. For the record, though, if they were so terribly anti-Muslim (since Palestine is largely Muslim), then why speak of Bosnia?\n\n&gt; Yeah, the KKK.\n\nThe KKK is your definition of neighborhood watch? Really? Burning crosses, lynching people?\n\n&gt; Who is it open to? They may let is ISRAELI Arabs (so long as they are meek and submissive to Jews) but the games are really only for Jews. Trying to deny that when it is just not being honest. Here is a motto I see \"Maccabi USA \u2013 Building Jewish Pride Through Sports\" So, imagine and event that is \"Building White Pride Through Sports\" being ignored by the media. That is itself a question - why does our media dutifully ignore this event? Why not express outrage about their exclusive nature?\n\nYou can read over the [origins and history](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-maccabiah-games) if you'd like. Rather enlightening as to why it was formed.\n\n&gt; Why is being held in Israel a point? What if they weren't? See: https://www.maccabiusa.com/\n\nAlready seen it. Clearly they feel that Israel is of important cultural heritage to them, which... given the history of the Jewish people, stemming back to Judaism, yes. Israel is an important area.\n\n&gt; Thanks for the link about the myth of \"soap.\"\n\nPeople did try it on a very small scale, but mass production doesn't have the evidence. Nevertheless, it is telling that no one would really be surprised if they did that.\n\n&gt; Look up \"chimney to nowhere.\" It is at Auschwitz. A chimney that was built by the Soviets and not even connected to the building. All there to create this mythos.\n\nDid so, and found no sources that I'd call reputable or reliable.\n\n&gt; Why? You seem to have overlooked a TYPHUS epidemic.\n\nYou think stuff like [this](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/children-during-the-holocaust) happened and all deaths were just caused by typhus?\n\n&gt; Ah, Shrodinger's Jew. They die in ovens yet also are here to talk about it as \"survivors.\"\n\nErm... no offense, but exactly how much research into this have you done?\n\n&gt; Why not, they were Soviet show-trials. US Supreme Court justice Harlan Stone called them a \"fraud.\"\n\nI gave you a link.\n\n&gt; Whites are under-represented in Congress and the Supreme Court. Jews are over-represented by a huge margin. There are at least 3 Jews on the Supreme Court. Sotomayor is also a Jew. That makes 4! https://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Sotomayors-Jewish-ties\n\nI told you she was non-observant. Additionally, I still ask the same questions: one, does it not concern you also that white people, Christians, and males are overrepresented in Congress and as presidents? Two, does it matter *what* they are as long as they do their jobs?\n\n&gt; What business is that? It is insignificant. Less than 1%.\n\nJewish ethnic food doesn't have a large section in my store.

In fact, it's probably made in the same factory that makes other products not aimed at pork, so it's covered.\n\n&gt; All kinda irrelevant, though, since the market for Kosher food is insignificant.\n\nNot completely. About 2% of Americans are Jewish, and I'd estimate that maybe half of those keep kosher to some degree. So that's 1% of people who are unlikely to buy your product if it isn't certified. That list includes me, by the way. Also, some Muslims will seek out kosher foods if they can't find halal. And apparently some goyim think kosher food is healthier (it isn't).\n\n&gt; Can you imagine foods needing to pay to be approved by Whites before they are sold? Whites make up a much larger percentage of the population. If your argument is that it would make marketing sense to be Kosher it would be more true for that!\n\nYou're still assuming that food that is not certified kosher cannot be sold. But not all packaged food is certified kosher. It just means that religious Jews (and certain others, apparently) won't buy them. Same reason why so many products are labeled vegan or gluten free. Does that mean there is a conspiracy of vegans or celiacs forcing food companies to pay them money?\n\nI concur with you that it is surprising that it makes financial sense for so many companies to go to the trouble of getting their products certified.

The bad thing, many anti-system people ARE in fact anti-semites and that tarnishes the whole movement.

Orb\u00e1n is using him as a scapegoat as do many corrupt wannabe autocrats including the former prime minister of my country (Slovakia). Orb\u00e1n is also a huge hypocrite as he liked Soros's money when he recieved it in the late 80s. But that doesn't mean Soros is a good guy.

{"author": "mhornberger", "body": "&gt; What happens if you keep an open mind and try to hear both sides?\n\nIf both sides are speaking in good faith and giving substantive arguments, sure.    That can be complicated with people who are not speaking in good faith, or not arguing explicitly for the agenda they're trying to move down the field.    Sometimes the objective is merely to create the illusion that there is a legitimate debate, such as over whether the holocaust happened, or vaccines cause autism, or Obama was a Muslim who hated America, etc.    There isn't much of a \"both sides\" potential for Alex Jones-style conspiracy theories and bizarro rhetoric, no more than there is with QAnon or similar.   \n\nHere are some interesting and relevant quotes from Sartre on the general theme I'm talking about:\n\n&gt;&gt;...the anti-Semite has chosen to live on the plane of passion. It is not unusual for people to elect to live a life of passion rather than one of reason. But ordinarily they love the objects of passion: women, glory, power, money. Since the anti-Semite has chosen hate, we are forced to conclude that it is the state of passion that he loves. Ordinarily this type of emotion is not very pleasant: a man who passionately desires a woman is impassioned because of the woman and in spite of his passion. We are wary of reasoning based on passion and of what is called monoideism. But that is just what the anti-Semite chooses right off.\n\n&gt;&gt;How can one choose to reason falsely? It is because of a longing for impenetrability. The rational man groans as he gropes for the truth; he knows that his reasoning is no more than tentative, that other considerations may supervene to cast doubt on it. He never sees clearly where he is going; he is \"open\"; he may even appear to be hesitant. But there are some people who are attracted to the durability of a stone. They wish to be massive and impenetrable; they wish not to change. Where, indeed, would change take them? We have here a basic fear of oneself and of truth. What frightens them is not the content of truth, of which they have no conception, but the form itself of truth, that thing of indefinite approximation. It is as if their own existence were in continual suspension. But they wish to exist all at once and right away. They do not want any acquired opinions; they want them to be innate. Since they are afraid of reasoning, they wish to lead the kind of life wherein reasoning and research play only a subordinate role, wherein one seeks only what he has already found, wherein one becomes only what he already was. This is nothing but passion. Only a strong emotional bias can give a lightning-like certainty; it alone can hold reason in leash; it alone can remain impervious to experience and last a whole lifetime.\n\n&gt;&gt;The anti-Semite has chosen hate because hate is a faith; at the outset he has chosen to devaluate words and reasons. How entirely at ease he feels as a result. How futile and frivolous discussions about the rights of the Jew appear to him. He has pleased himself on other ground from the beginning. If out of courtesy he consents for a moment to defend his point of view, he lends himself but does not give himself. He tries simply to project his intuitive certainty onto the plane of discourse. I mentioned awhile back some remarks by anti-Semites, all of them absurd: \"I hate Jews because they make servants insubordinate, because a Jewish furrier robbed me, etc.\" **Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert.** If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past. ...\"\n\n&gt;&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/mt/talmud/sartre.htm\n\n&gt;&gt;http://abahlali.org/files/Jean-Paul_Sartre_Anti-Semite_and_Jew_An_Exploration_of_the_Etiology_of_Hate__1995.pdf", "score": 6, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "politics", "date_year_month": "2019-01", "created_utc_converted": "2019-01-23 06:16:13", "score_overall": 4, "words": "holocaust conspiracy jew jewish", "shared_words": "holocaust conspiracy jew jewish", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "BrockManstrong", "body": "Speaking of empowering evil: \n\n&gt; The President is creating a government shutdown crisis predicated on lies and racist rhetoric about illegal immigration.\n\n&gt; According to the right wing think tank the CATO Institute, President Trump's administration has provided an incredibly misleading narrative about illegal immigration and crime.[1]\n\n&gt; But we should not tolerate the peddling of misleading statistics without context. What matters is how dangerous these subpopulations are relative to each other so the government can allocate resources to prevent the greatest number of murders possible. Thus, enforcing immigration law more harshly is an ineffective way to punish a population that is less likely to murder or commit crimes than native-born Americans. Illegal immigrants, non-citizens, and legal immigrants are less likely to be\u00a0incarcerated,\u00a0convicted, or\u00a0arrested\u00a0for crimes than native-born Americans are.\u00a0\n\n&gt; The Washington Post compiled statistical charts that indicate the Trump administration is lying when they claim illegal immigration is a crisis. They disprove Trump's lies including immigrants flooding the border (they're not), that they bring crime (they don't), and that they're a drain on the economy (they aren't).[2]\n\n&gt; The administration\u00a0has said\u00a0that the country is in danger of being \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by \u201cmassive increases in illegal crossings\u201d that will bring \u201chorrible crime,\u201d \u201cunbelievably great taxpayer expense\u201d and\u00a0the loss of American jobs.\n\n&gt; None of those claims are\u00a0true.\n\n&gt; ...Here's what we can say in conclusion.\u00a0Current rates of illegal immigration remain extremely low by historic standards. Legal and undocumented immigrants are significantly less likely to commit most crimes than native-born citizens, making them a net benefit to public safety.\u00a0The research shows that immigrants are not taking jobs away from\u00a0U.S. natives, and their impact on wages appears to be small to nonexistent, particularly across the long term.\n\n&gt; President Trump's rhetoric is incredibly dangerous and is reminiscent of authoritarian leaders who have committed crimes against humanity.\n\n&gt; The President's rhetoric - his referral to undocumented immigrants as \"infesting\" the United States is incredibly dangerous and it is not the first time he has alluded to white nationalist talking points. First he tweeted it[3] followed by him saying this as a statement during a speech later in the day.[4] Moreover, former Trump Campaign Chairman Cory Lewandowski went on national television and dehumanized a child with Down Syndrome who had been separated from their family.[5] President Trump has peddled anti-semetic conspiracies including the conspiracy that a prominent Jew is behind the migrant caravans[6] that he claims are \"invading\" the country.[7] And Fox News has repeated extremely dangerous xenophobic rhetoric that these migrants are bringing diseases with them, they're not.[8]\n\n&gt; Some experts have compared the President's statements to Nazi propaganda.[9]\n\n&gt; Social commentators pointed out that history has shown, particularly before and during the Holocaust, that \u201cinfest\u201d \u2014 a term almost exclusively used to describe vermin \u2014 dehumanizes a population and is often a precursor to murder or genocide.\n\n&gt; \u201cDemocrats are the problem. They don\u2019t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cThey can\u2019t win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters!\u201d\n\n&gt; One of the most notorious anti-Semitic films produced by Nazi Germany\u2019s Ministry of Propaganda was \u201cDer ewige Jude\u201d (\u201cThe Eternal Jew\u201d), with input from propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.\n\n&gt; The US Holocaust Memorial Museum says that \u201cOne of the film\u2019s most notorious sequences compares Jews to rats that carry contagion, flood the continent, and devour precious resources.\u201d\n\n&gt; These xenophobic conspiracy theories are incredibly dangerous. Recently a far right conspiracist murdered 11 people in a Synagogue.[10] The murderer believed in the same xenophobic, racist conspiracies that were being peddled by members of the GOP, President Trump and the American rightwing media sphere.^[11]\n\n &gt; 1.\t\u2060CATO Institute - The White House\u2019s Misleading &amp; Error Ridden Narrative on Immigrants and Crime\n2.\t\u2060Washington Post - There\u2019s no immigration crisis, and these charts prove it\n3.\t\u2060Fox News - Republican pressure intensifies to end family separations at border\n4.\t\u2060Fox St. Louis - Trump ramps up rhetoric: Dems want \u2018illegal immigrants\u2019 to \u2018infest our country\u2019\n5.\t\u2060Washington Post - \u2018Womp womp\u2019: Corey Lewandowski mocks story of child with Down syndrome separated from parents\n6.\t\u2060The Hill - Trump: 'I wouldn't be surprised' if Soros were paying for migrant caravan\n7.\t\u2060PBS - WATCH: Trump defends calling migrant caravan an \u2018invasion\u2019 ahead of midterm elections\n8.\t\u2060Vox - Fox News says the migrant caravan will bring disease outbreaks.

With literally genocidal results as recently as the 1940s?\n\nLook, I'm not making this up.

'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine' Actor Armin Shimerman Answers\n\n&gt;Andrew Whalen @AndWhalen 09/02/16 \n\n&gt;Space Jews are an unfortunate science fiction trope that repackages a number of repulsive anti-semitic stereotypes, typically to vivify a conniving, mercantile race of aliens with easily recognized prejudicial characteristics. Between Watto, Gringotts goblins and South Park\u2019s parodic Joozians, the Space Jew trope is potent and common enough that the name has come to stand for lazy stereotyping as character shorthand.\n\n&gt;Star Trek, despite its reputation for embodying progressive values in its cast and adventures, is far from innocent in this regard. After their first appearance on Star Trek: The Next Generation, Ferengi became comedic foils for Picard and his crew, but the Jewish stereotyping was hard to miss. They were often depicted as blinded by greed, lascivious in their appetites and snivelling in their demeanor, with big noses dwarfed only by elephantine, erogenous ears. They lived by the quasi-religious \u201cRules of Acquisition,\u201d which encouraged them to cheat, manipulate and do everything possible for profit.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/08/14/science-fictions-anti-semitism-problem/\n\n&gt;Science fiction\u2019s anti-Semitism problem\n\n&gt;Paul B.

And where the Korvax are logical robots and the Vy\u2019keen are proud warriors, the Gek are scheming capitalists.\n\n&gt;In short, these characters are yet another retread of a tired, anti-Semitic stereotype given a sci-fi veneer. This is, unfortunately, fairly common for speculative fiction: Stereotyped crypto-Jews have long filled the fantasy and science-fiction genres \u2014 from J.K. Rowling\u2019s goblins to Watto in \u201cStar Wars\u201d to the dwarves in \u201cThe Hobbit.\u201d\n\n&gt;Creating characters that embody anti-Semitic stereotypes is not always an expression of overt bias. Rather, these characters may have been unwittingly developed from caricatures drawn from pervasive stereotypes about Jews. These caricatures have been remixed and ingrained in popular culture over centuries from sources as varied as \u201cThe Merchant of Venice,\u201d \u201cCandide\u201d and \u201cOliver Twist.\u201d In short, these modern creators may have reproduced anti-Semitic caricatures despite, rather than because of, their intentions.\n\n&gt;The \u201cgreedy Jew\u201d stereotype began in the 11th and 12th centuries as new Jewish communities sprung up across Western Europe. \n\nhttps://io9.gizmodo.com/10-of-the-most-embarrassing-racial-and-ethnic-stereotyp-5789501?IR=T\n\n&gt;10 of the most embarrassing racial and ethnic stereotypes in science fiction\n\n&gt;Annalee Newitz 4/06/11 1:56pm\n\n&gt;Nemoidians in Star Wars\n\n&gt;As they grease the wheels of the Trade Federation's relationship with the growing evil of the Empire, these aliens make noises that sound alarming like \"ahhh so\" and do a lot of bowing.

{"author": "AfraidKiwi", "body": "&gt;If you told me this time last year, that come January 2019, I\u2019d be standing in parliament, addressing a room full of people at a Holocaust memorial event, describing the hideous abuse I\u2019ve been receiving daily since I started speaking about the growing problem of antisemitism in the UK, I wouldn\u2019t know where to begin with my incredulity!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My own identity as a Jew has been a confusing one. As I often joke, my mum\u2019s Jewish, and my dad\u2019s Man United and we\u2019ve worshipped far more often at the Theatre of Dreams than I\u2019ve ever been to shul.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As a child I knew not to sing the Jesus bit in the assembly hymns, but the bacon sandwiches Mum\u2019d feed us, meant I didn\u2019t quite know where we fit into all of this. However one part of my Jewish identity, which forms part of my very being, is the deep and irreparable sorrow I feel in relation to the Holocaust.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I\u2019ve always known, that having only one Jewish grandparent, in the lifetime of my own Jewish grandparents, was enough for some to feel justified in carrying out unspeakable acts of inhumanity against them, like ripping babies out of mothers\u2019 arms and smashing them against walls.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I visited Auschwitz for the first time in November. Most memorable to me were the videos in the Shoah exhibition of normal-looking people in the 1930s \u2014 Jews \u2014 having fun in swimsuits on the beach, playing cricket, enjoying family get-togethers, who would soon be reduced to dust, a tiny amount of which, you can also see while there.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The enormous mountain of hair, including little girls\u2019 plaits, some blonde, some brunette, tied neatly, presumably by their loving mothers before they would have to say goodbye forever, with all that would be left of them cut off to be made into fabric. I\u2019ve never experienced the literal feeling of being emotionally punched in the stomach like I did standing by that display.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I\u2019d never understood why they did this, nor did I try to get inside the mindset of a Nazi, to empathise with their feelings or work out why anyone could ever think this was \u201cnoble\u201d. I thought all Jew-haters were like them, loud and proud and acting through irrational hate which could neither be explained nor understood, and I also thought that the horrors of the Holocaust would mean that antisemitism would never rear its ugly head again. Sadly, I was wrong on both counts.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I first started following the story of antisemitism in Labour after the protest outside parliament last March. I started listening and I started reading. And the more I read, the more shocked I became.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At first it was only online. Rothschild bankers here, Holocaust revision there, but gradually, I began to see the ripple effects from this undercurrent of antisemitism appearing in places I would never have expected.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I finally broke my silence when a number of bus stops in London, the city where I live, were plastered with \u201cIsrael is a Racist Endeavour\u201d posters \u2014 a reaction to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s attempt to omit parts of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s definition of antisemitism.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Knowing how decimating the Holocaust was in the years immediately preceding Israel\u2019s inception, and the desperate plights that people faced to flee somewhere, anywhere, to safety, and how often they were refused and turned away, I found this description as to the character of Israel\u2019s existence deeply offensive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Without irony, I\u2019m shown just how little many people understand about antisemitism, simultaneously denying any evidence of it while actively participating in it, vilifying me, the Jew calling it out as a paid-Israeli-shill, angrily comparing Israel to Nazis, or classing me as \u201cZionist racist scum\u201d, in response to me posting about anything but the subject of Israel and Palestine.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They cry \u201csmear\u201d or \u201canti-Zionism is not antisemitism\u201d, even in the face of outright Holocaust denial, finding new and obscene ways to explain it away or obfuscate it, echoing the excuses often heard from their political heroes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On Twitter, the messages I\u2019m sent are often indistinguishable from those you\u2019d expect from a neo-Nazi, yet the tweeters are identifiably not neo-Nazis. The markers of the red Labour rose, coupled with the Palestinian flag and the hashtags of \u201cGet the Tories Out\u201d and \u201cJeremy Corbyn for PM\u201d along with standard claim to be \u201cagainst racism in ALL forms\u201d, are their signature giveaways. If I had a penny for every cry of \u201cwhere\u2019s your evidence\u201d at the bottom of a whole thread of evidence, I\u2019d be as rich as the so-called Rothschild bankers they hate so much.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the name of Labour, I\u2019ve been called a hypocrite, lying propagandist, teeth, tits and ass, clothes-horse dolly-bird, weaponiser of antisemitism, fascist, right-wing extremist, Nazi-sympathiser, Twitter-cancer, thick, Tory, brainwashed, an antisemite, white-supremacist, hate preacher, Zio-political trollster, not a real Jew, a child bully, bonkers mad conspiracy theorist, a paedo-protector minion puppet by whom my dead grandfather would be disgusted.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After I used the recent anniversary of my ten years as *Countdown*\u2019s numbers lady as an opportunity to give this topic a bigger platform, with an on-camera interview, an 11,500-word article was written with the sole intention of discrediting many brave and dedicated people standing up to antisemitism.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I can only describe this article as A-grade conspiracy garbage, complete with go-to clips that neo-Nazi like to use to \u201cprove\u201d that \u201cantisemitism\u2019s just a trick\u201d. Twenty-five per cent of the article was about me, including how I\u2019m antisemitic, and how I should be fired. Subsequently, rewarded for his efforts, the author of this article tweeted delightedly to have been followed on Twitter by both John McDonnell, the Labour shadow chancellor, and Jennie Formby, Labour general secretary. (I remain unfollowed.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On my birthday, I was shown a tweet from Karl Hansen, political adviser to Andy McDonald, Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, which told his followers how I \u201csmear\u201d my \u201cpolitical opponents\u201d, boost troll accounts and don\u2019t stand up to bullying \u2014 I am a bully.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is the tactic used over and over again against Jews, and indeed against anyone speaking out against antisemitism in the Labour Party. The victim becomes the aggressor, and the aggressor becomes the wronged-party. It\u2019s gaslighting. They can\u2019t attack the facts, so they attack the messenger.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I\u2019ve had to do so much research and learning to even begin to have the tools to fight this. I\u2019ve read books, watched videos, taken an online course, spoken to experts, spoken to Jewish groups, spoken to Labour Party members and MPs. I spent six hours on Christmas Day watching educational videos on the history of antisemitism, including so much not-so-festive stuff about the Holocaust.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It pains me to revisit these atrocities, it tires me, it angers me, but knowledge and truth are our only weapons. If I can do this in only a couple of months there is no excuse for any Labour official not to take up the same kind of learning themselves, when they clearly still haven\u2019t got to grips with understanding this problem.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You need to know next to nothing to propagate Nazi or Soviet Jew-hating propaganda, reframed to fit today\u2019s narrative, which spreads like wildfire and is DANGEROUS. But you need to know nearly EVERYTHING in order to combat it. The odds are stacked in the antisemite\u2019s favour. And for every Labour official who labels this a smear, for every disciplinary decision that gives the perpetrator a free pass while its victims are abused or even disciplined themselves, is a disgrace.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My level of engagement in this issue is directly proportional to the amount of antisemitism and hostility to Jews and their allies I\u2019m witness to, which is why it\u2019s consuming my life.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Since speaking out, I\u2019ve attracted the attention of the who\u2019s who of antisemites and apologists, who\u2019ve publicly criticised me. Neo-Nazis, naturally, have also shown their interest. A Labour Party secretary repeatedly libelled me to Channel 4, ignoring my requests for her to check her facts and stop.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Labour supporters have taken it upon themselves to contact my employers, calling for me to be sacked, suggesting we should rename our show *8 out of 10 Cats does Paedophilia* in my honour. I\u2019ve seen thousands of untrue slights against my character, with those making them, knowing they can do so to praise from their echo-chambers, with all likelihood of impunity \u2014 yet one misplaced word from me could be ruinous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "LabourUK", "date_year_month": "2019-01", "created_utc_converted": "2019-01-25 08:15:55", "score_overall": 20, "words": "holocaust jew jewish jewish holocaust jewish jewish jew holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust jew holocaust jew conspiracy conspiracy jewish holocaust jew", "shared_words": "holocaust jew jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "SaltMeeting", "body": "To the OP,\nnormally people just avoid topic\u2019s likes these and take the stance that the public has in fear of being labeled racist, anti Semitic and bigots if they dive into it. Honestly it takes people with backbone to look into the darkness and have a counter view point that goes against society.\n\nMost people are content with thinking hitler hated the Jews and used them as a scapegoat without ever thinking about the question of \u201c why did hitler hate the Jews or pick them as a scapegoat\u201d? There has to be a reason? They won\u2019t look for hitlers own words on the subjects and will take the word of a Jewish historian as gospel like it\u2019s going to be unbiased because they believe hitlers reasons are unjustifiable so it doesn\u2019t matter. Aka why would I take the word of a mass murderer? &lt;\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 this answer means they have already come to a conclusion on the subject and as such will dismiss anything that counters this conclusion aka holocaust numbers simply become arbitrary bickering over semantics not a clue that something is wrong with the story and as such maybe they need to review it with more attention.\n\nAs far as jailing people or holocaust denial it\u2019s a shameful act as well as blaming the very descendants of the people who supposedly helped free the Jews from the Germans is again a shameful act. For crying out loud these people are the grandchildren of the men and women who fought to save you and they are being called nazi or in prisoned. \n\nI understand Jews look at anti-semitism as a trend like it comes in and out of vogue and not as a symptom of their own actions as a unified group that have pushed people to become that way. Aka it\u2019s just trendy to hate people and blame them for your problems which we Jews are the victims of constantly through out history so they say.\nThe victim mentality mixed with the god chosen mythology and the world is just haters type of reasoning leads them down the path that makes them hated. One could reason that it makes Them sociopaths based of the mental state of being brought up in a world where you are told your gods chosen people and for that everyone else is going to hate you and try and kill you and when you add in the fact that being Jewish isn\u2019t just being religious it\u2019s an identity then it gets down right Stockholm syndromey and they are willing drones in their tribe for fear of the evil non Jews willing to attack them. All negative criticism of Jews gets labeled as anti-semitism even if the criticism is warranted as a problem with their community.\n\nIt\u2019s a physiological issue that Jewish communities and organizations and families make by the way they teach their children. \n\nHowever I\u2019m getting off point.\n\nMost people don\u2019t even know what the word holocaust means!\n\nIt was first used in a  version of a Greek bible and it means burnt offerings to a god. The passage in which holocaust is used talks about how Israelites shouldn\u2019t \u201cholocaust\u201d aka burnt sacrifice their children to the god moloch. Moloch was a giant bull half man statue where the belly was a pit of fire that people would throw their children into for favors by the god.\n\nSo why call what happened in WW2 a holocaust? What did Israel get after the war? Their homeland maybe. Now they are trying to change the name to Shoia \n\nNow the reasoning most people laugh at \u2014-so you think that Jews created the holocaust to get an ancient god to give them back their promise land? Which is not what I\u2019m saying they did create the holocaust to push public perception in their favor so they could receive their homeland. Using holocaust simply means they sacrificed there own and that feeds into the reason they want you to believe the myth of crematoriums and death camps because they still need their own people to believe this myth. Because like I stated before it brings them together it allows them to ignore their own injustices, blame the world around them and allows them to be ruthless to everyone who isn\u2019t a Jew.\n\nThe fact is they don\u2019t really care if non Jews don\u2019t believe in the holocaust they care that their own people still do but know they will lose some of their own if it isn\u2019t completely excepted by everyone. This is why they keep pushing it over and over and over again.", "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "conspiracy", "date_year_month": "2019-01", "created_utc_converted": "2019-01-28 21:52:53", "score_overall": 16, "words": "scapegoat scapegoat jewish holocaust holocaust jewish jewish holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust jew holocaust", "shared_words": "scapegoat jewish holocaust jew", "socre_distint": 4}
