Israel can do better in their treatment of Palestinians but none of that comes close to how the Palestinians treat Jews, how Arabs treat Jews or how Arabs treat other Arabs. The world needs to come together alright, we need to do everything in our power to stop the opec nations from continually exploiting the Palestinian situation to attack the only jewish nation in existence, we need to force a peace deal on the Arabs at all cost and most assertively we need to end any and all support for islamo fascist and other religious bullshit pr for hijab wearing democrats.

I will leave you simply with this.... this is the type of evil the jews have dealt with for centuries, I do not expect you or anyone on here to be convinced, most of the world is anti-Semitic and against them regardless but hopefully someone reads more into this conflict and wonder. Why are there 600,000 dead arabs in Syria being brutally killed by an arab dictator yet white kids in the west once again are attacking the Jews for defending themselves against the very same Arabs? I mean the arab-israel conflict death toll total is 40,000. Israel is smaller than jersey. Why does anyone care? it's the same reason why we died in iraq, In aghanistan, the arab world is spending billions to foster a hostile environment and propaganda in the western sphere to promote a blockade on the jewish state and fostering a innate hatred of the jewish people in the common citizens of their country. Don't believe me? think i'm a shill myself? Read up on this bitch and her son:\"Speaking on Al Jazeera in May 2001, Daqamseh's mother said, \"I am proud of my son, and I hold my head high. My son did a heroic deed and has pleased god and his own conscience. My son lifts my head and the head of the entire Arab and Islamic nation. I am proud of any Muslim who does what Ahmad did. I hope that I am not saying something wrong. When my son went to prison, they asked him: 'Ahmad, do you regret it?' He answered: 'I have no regrets.' He treated everyone to coffee, honored all the other prisoners, and said: The only thing that I am angry about is the gun, which did not work properly. Otherwise I would have killed all of the passengers on the bus.\"[15] \"\n\nNow tell me if Israel is the issue why did they kill them in 1929 long before Israel existed? if the Zionist were the actual issue why did Sephardi Jews living there long before the pbuh left his desert and conquered the region, why did they brutally massacre these jews who were there neighbors and friends? ask yourself why. The question and answer is obvious. The Arabs only care about Israel because it's a challenge to their arab supremacy, their pan arab nationalist dreams and a historical humiliation. They don't care about Palestinians. Never did, never will. Even if they managed to kill the jews in Israel they will simply go back to their usual targets Christians, atheist, gays, women's or the occasional heretic.

{"author": "IDFSHILL", "body": "This dates back hundreds and hundreds of years ago. The book suspicious minds sums it up:\n\n&gt; Superstition and prejudice toward Jews dates back to the earliest years of Christianity. Saint John Chrysostom, a fourth-century preacher widely admired for his eloquence, eloquently denounced Jews as baby-killing devil worshipers. In 1215, Pope Innocent III was concerned that Christians might find themselves unwittingly having relations with Jews. His solution was to make Jews wear distinguishing clothing, leading to the yellow \u201cbadge of shame\u201d that many Jewish people around Europe were required to wear throughout the Dark Ages\u2014and again under the Nazis. A couple of decades later, Pope Gregory IX established the Inquisition, a formalized effort to prosecute heresy against the Roman Catholic Church, which eventually led to mass executions of Jews, among other accused heretics, and mass burnings of their holy books.\n\n&gt; According to the pious logic of some medieval theologians, the Jewish Talmud was both blasphemous and, paradoxically, a testament to the truth of Christian teaching. Just as the Devil knows the truth of Christianity but is determined to deny it and destroy those who believe it, so too, Christian scholars argued, do the Jews. People came to see Jews as being in league with Satan, possessing arcane knowledge and black magic, and harboring an unquenchable hatred for Christianity. Allegations that Jewish people were plotting against Christians became commonplace.\n\n&gt; One popular theory had it that Jews were in the habit of poisoning Christian drinking wells. When the Black Plague ravaged fourteenth-century Europe, outbreaks were often blamed on the international Jewish well-poisoning conspiracy. In some cases, torturers coerced confessions from a handful of Jewish suspects, on the basis of which thousands more were burned alive. The worst of the pogroms was in Strasbourg. Fear-stricken locals, desperate to prevent the plague from reaching them, decided to preemptively slaughter the town\u2019s Jews. (Some of the town\u2019s nobility were also in debt to Jewish money-lenders, and may have seen an opportunity to clear their tab.) City authorities attempted to intervene but couldn\u2019t hold the mob at bay. All told, around nine hundred Jewish people were burned alive, and the rest were baptized or banished. The plague soon swept through town regardless, leaving sixteen thousand people dead in its wake.\n\n&gt; There was also the \u201cblood libel\u201d\u2014the allegation that Jewish people routinely murder Christians and drain them of their blood, which they allegedly used to make the Passover meal, to make medicine to heal their physical defects, or to perform unholy rituals. The myth was invented in the twelfth century, when a young Christian boy was found dead on the outskirts of Norwich, England, the day before Easter Sunday. Thomas of Monmouth, a Benedictine monk turned amateur detective, offered a convoluted explanation. Jewish teaching, he claimed, asserts that Jews must spill Christian blood in order to regain their homeland. Thus, a secret council of Jewish elites convenes once a year to select a sacrificial Christian child. Monmouth\u2019s idea caught on. For centuries thereafter, whenever a Christian child went missing or turned up dead, local Jews were often the first suspects.\n\n&gt; These religiously motivated fears circulated for centuries. Meanwhile, Jews in many regions were denied citizenship and property rights, confined to ghettos, or banished from Christian society altogether. This began to change in the wake of the French Revolution, when many Jewish people were granted basic human rights and began to emerge from isolation. They naturally tended to favor liberal and democratic political policies that represented their best hope of increasing liberty. Still sidelined from traditional occupations, many migrated to the cities and pioneered inventive new ways of making a living. While most remained impoverished and out of sight, a few became extremely wealthy.\n\n&gt; This all led to new social tensions. A lot of people weren\u2019t thrilled about the radical changes taking place around them. For some, the newly integrated Jews became a defining symbol of the modern world. The age-old prejudice that had given rise to the blood libel and well-poisoning myths was reinvigorated and updated to reflect modern anxieties and resentments. Jews were no longer enemies of God, but enemies of man. In 1879, a new word, antisemitism, was coined to reflect the fact that what was once a collection of primitive medieval superstitions had become a fully-fledged political ideology.\n\nBasically, it kind of snowballed from a religious thing to what we see today. Why? Well, Jews tended to favor parties on the left during times when society was being seriously changed and liberalized and some jews were very visible. \n\nA convenient scapegoat. \n\nThe \"white\" aspect is because a lot of white nationalists view Christianity as \"culturally white.\" So naturally if you believe jews are out to destroy western Christianity, you'd believe they're out to get the \"white race.\"", "score": 9, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "neoliberal", "date_year_month": "2019-02", "created_utc_converted": "2019-02-06 10:32:12", "score_overall": 15, "words": "jewish jewish jewish jewish conspiracy jewish jewish jewish libel jewish jewish jewish jewish libel scapegoat", "shared_words": "jewish conspiracy libel scapegoat", "socre_distint": 4}
{"author": "AlmightyB", "body": "Is there a name for the moment something objectionable becomes so mainstream that those responsible can solemnly lament it as a fact of life? I propose that we call it the Formby Point. This week, Labour\u2019s general secretary Jennie Formby reportedly told a parliamentary party meeting that it was \u2018impossible to eradicate anti-Semitism and it would be dishonest to claim to be able to do so\u2019. Note the sly wording, the subtle distancing; you can almost hear the affected sigh of resignation. The woman who runs an institutionally racist party that refuses to challenge its institutional racism can, with a straight face, regret the inevitability of racism. \n\nAs a matter of fact, it is possible to eradicate anti-Semitism from a membership-based organisation. You just revoke the membership of all the anti-Semites. Of course, Formby can\u2019t do this because it would mean sacrificing a tidy sum in monthly subs and having to find a new leader. In a broader sense, no, you can\u2019t eliminate Jew-hatred from the general population but nor can you fully be rid of inequality or poverty or unemployment. That doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t try. There used to be an entire political party dedicated to just this proposition. \n\nThe Formby Point allows Labour to abdicate responsibility for its own anti-Semitism and for its role in replenishing the reserves of anti-Semitism in the world at large. Here too we have arrived at a tipping point. Anti-Semitism was kept at bay in the decades after the Holocaust. As a result it was channeled through anti-Zionism (the denial of Jewish national rights) and anti-Israelism (the political stigmatisation of the Jewish state). This has been the uneasy truce for the last few decades, tolerated even as a steady growth in anti-Semitism was recorded because it was most loudly expressed as hatred of Israel. (Israel enjoys a unique position as both the dark heart of the international Zionist conspiracy and imposter state that has nothing to do with Jews. It\u2019s the only country you can despise without ever being accused of xenophobia.)\n\nThis tawdry peace was only going to hold so long and the outbreak of populism occasioned by the 2008 recession allowed the pretences to be done away with. Refined campus anti-Semitism \u2014 Jew-hatred with an Edward Said quote up top \u2014 and street-level \u2018We are all Hezbollah\u2019 Islamism were limited because they required of their adherents a level of commitment and effort. Popular anti-Semitism is so much more powerful because it is not discrete to a particular sub-group or knowledge base. It is unfiltered, unpretentious contempt for Jews, all the old political, religious and racial canards set free from the constraints of code and metaphor.\n\nA decade ago, when I first began researching and writing about anti-Semitism, the talk was of the \u2018new anti-Semitism\u2019 but what confronts us today is anything but new. It is the blood libel and the Protocols, the poisoned well and the puppet strings \u2014 updated, repurposed, made shareable but recognisable still as tropes from the time of Christ and before. There is more awareness now than ten years ago \u2014 the volume and outlandishness of anti-Semitism make it impossible to avoid \u2014 but while there is concern and even indignation our response is muted by the sheer banality of this ever-restive evil. Anti-Semitism has lost its visceral punch, its power to appall. It has become pedestrian, mundane. Like the frog in the simmering pot, we feel the temperature rising but cannot conceive of boiling point. This is how bias makes its way into the mainstream and anti-Semitism, to our boundless shame, is once again an idea of the mainstream. It is ceasing to be a prejudice and becoming a point of view.\n\nToo alarmist for your tastes? Five per cent of Britons believe the Holocaust never happened, eight per cent that it has been exaggerated, and one in five that fewer than two million Jews were murdered. Anti-Semitism accounts for 58 per cent of religiously-motivated hate crimes in the United States. Anti-Semitic acts increased by 69 per cent in France last year, in Australia by 60 per cent, and were at record levels in Canada. One in three Europeans believe Jews have too much power; a third of Germans say commemorating the Holocaust is a distraction from other atrocities; 50 per cent of Poles think Jews exploit the Holocaust for their own advancement. The leader of the French left, Jean-Luc Melenchon, and the leader of the French far-right, Marine Le Pen, both openly deny France\u2019s complicity in the Holocaust. The prime minister of Malaysia claims \u2018Jews rule the world by proxy\u2019 and urges Muslims \u2018to plan, to strategise and then to counterattack\u2026 The Europeans killed six million Jews out of 12 million\u2019. Jeremy Corbyn, a serial antagoniser of Jews, could well be Britain\u2019s next prime minister.\n\nThe Labour Party, one of the largest left-wing movements in the world today, is owed a great debt of blame here. Evidence that it has allowed anti-Semitism to spill over into the mainstream left is abundant. Former MP Jim Sheridan has been readmitted to Labour following suspension for announcing he had lost his \u2018respect and empathy for the Jewish community\u2019 because of \u2018what they and their Blairite plotters are doing to my party\u2019. Upon his reinstatement, he said the complainants had \u2018overreacted\u2019 to \u2018criticism of those intent on undermining our leadership\u2019. Consider the actions of the University and College Union branch that organised a Holocaust Memorial Day event in Newcastle at which Yvonne Ridley was a guest speaker. Former Respect candidate Ridley once declared that, while other parties were \u2018riddled with Zionists\u2019, hers was \u2018Zionist-free\u2019 and any Zionists would be \u2018hunted down and kicked out\u2019. She asserts that \u2018invoking the Holocaust\u2019 is \u2018a favourite trick of the Zionist state\u2019 and says \u2018the Zionists have tentacles everywhere\u2019. She has called David Miliband \u2018a gutless, little weasel who lost more than his foreskin when he was circumcised\u2019. Labour MP Liz Twist, who shared a platform with Ridley at the event, later apologised. \n\nMPs who condemn institutional anti-Semitism while remaining in a party that refuses to address it have convinced themselves, their local members, even some in the Jewish community. The voters, though? They\u2019re not party to the frustrated group chats; they never hear about that motion you passed at your CLP last week. They spot their local MP, who once went to a rally outside Parliament about something to do with Jews, down the precinct every Saturday with a red rosette. They see Labour MPs staying and assume Labour is a party worth staying in. As the campaigning lawyer Mark Lewis writes of Jeremy Corbyn: \u2018He has moved the rock and the anti-Semites have crawled out. They are not going back.\u2019\n\nCorbyn did not shift that rock alone and neither did the left. Consider how the Tories suck up to Viktor Orban, who has waged a vendetta against George Soros, complete with billboards depicting the Jewish philanthropist as a puppet master. Or how Republican congresscrank Steve King endorsed a far-right mayoral candidate best known for appearing on a neo-Nazi podcast.\n\nWhat about a little closer to home? Taki Theodoracopulos is the star columnist \u2014 and a gifted one at that \u2014 on a magazine known for being firmly Zionist and even philo-Semitic. Yet a root around The Spectator\u2019s archives throws up reams of self-indictment. He has called New York \u2018Tel Aviv-by-the-Hudson\u2019, claimed Jews \u2018control Hollywood\u2019 and declares \u2018Jews are not the types to let bygones be bygones\u2019. He has lambasted \u2018rich American Jews who encourage unacceptable and brutal behaviour against innocents\u2019, averred that \u2018the Jewish lobby in America has stifled debate\u2019, and has pronounced that \u2018almost all the people who have made billions through insider trading, greenmailing, leveraged buyouts and junk bonds are Jews\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhenever Corbynistas complain that The Spectator doesn\u2019t publish any columnists to their way of thinking, I recommend they subscribe just for Taki. \n\nThe old politics of the centre was decried for excluding those further left or right, which it did and built up resentment and alienation. The new politics excludes nobody and views and actions that would once have been cordoned off have polluted the mainstream. Stray far enough in either direction and politics becomes a series of conspiracy theories about who has what, who runs what and who hides what. The left says the world is run by a capitalist cabal, the right says it\u2019s run by a globalist cabal, but both believe unwaveringly in the existence of a cabal. Anti-Semitism is a conspiracy theory of Jewish power and perfidy ideally suited to times of paranoia and instability. It may be impossible to eradicate fully but we are barely even trying. We are, left and right, making it safe for anti-Semites to come out from behind their various guises and hate Jews in the open once more.", "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "date_year_month": "2019-02", "created_utc_converted": "2019-02-07 12:32:54", "score_overall": 21, "words": "jew holocaust jewish jewish conspiracy jew libel holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust jewish holocaust holocaust jewish jewish jewish conspiracy globalist conspiracy jewish", "shared_words": "jew holocaust jewish conspiracy libel globalist", "socre_distint": 6}
{"author": "tiedyedvortex", "body": "So you're bouncing around between a bunch of different arguments here and they're all wrong. Let me go point-by-point.\n\n&gt; The Bard wrote about one character, Shylock. He didn't title his play: An example that typifies all Jews.\n\nBut, he did exist in a space where people already held beliefs that \"all Jews are greedy bastards\" and then he used that belief to create a Jewish greedy bastard. He didn't create the stereotype, no, but if he's reinforcing it by presenting it as true. You can't look at Shylock out of context of thousands of years of antisemitism; it's racist precisely because it is repeating a hurtful generalization, and whether or not Shakespeare intended it to be hurtful doesn't change the fact that it is.\n\n&gt; It just seems that certain minorities object to anything they consider negative and attempt to control all discourse. \n\nThis is a racist dogwhistle if ever there was one. You are claiming here that the problem with racist language isn't that it's dangerous and hurtful to people, but that it is somehow the victims' fault for being hurt by it. Furthermore, it's pretty clear that by \"certain minorities\" who \"attempt to control all discourse\" that you are buying into the modern incarnation of the racist \"greedy Jew\" myth, which is to say the completely bullshit idea that there is a cabal of Jews manipulating society. This is a lie that has been used to justify every heinous act done against the Jewish people for centuries, most notably, by the Nazis and the Holocaust. \n\n&gt;You may think this is a good way to end negative generalizations, but I can assure you it's a really risky strategy likely to backfire.\n\nHow, exactly, would it backfire? If people don't repeat racist talking points and perspectives, then they lack the ability to effectively organize into racist hate mobs, and other people are less likely to be swept into their hateful rhetoric. Racism isn't something that people generate in isolation and discharge safely, like a fart. Limiting people's ability to be racist isn't going to somehow make them suddenly more racist.\n\n&gt; I know plenty of millennials, more left than right, who say critical things of Jews or used coded language about Jews or Zionists. \n\nFirst, nothing said so far has been about millenials or political leftist/rightist. Second, even if this were relevant, claiming that the amount of leftist hate speech is even remotely comparable to right-wing hate speech is laughably untrue. There is no fascist left-wing, but the current sitting US president is tightly allied with fascist politics. And third, even if it were true that everyone were racist, that wouldn't make it okay. A popular bad thing is still bad.\n\n&gt; Should people have the right to criticize Israel? Wealthy Jews who don't seem too charitable? \n\nYes, they should. But there's a difference between criticizing Israel as a nation for it's policies (and there is a lot to criticize) and criticizing Israel for being the Jewish state. Likewise, people who are wealthy and misuse their wealth definitely deserve criticism, but their personal faith or ethnicity should not be in any way relevant. \n\n&gt; I think if you cut off free speech you just have pressure build and that's the real danger often.\n\nAgain you have this \"pressure building\" idea that just is nonsense--what \"pressure\"? That isn't how anything works. Silencing racism doesn't cause people to become more racist. And secondly, falling back on the \"free speech\" defense is the last resort of anyone saying something they really ought not to be saying. It is an argument that \"I should be allowed to say this because it's wrong to make me stop\". But in reality, free speech does not mean anyone saying anything to anyone. Just as a basic list of free speech exceptions, consider copyright laws, libel/slander laws, laws against inciting violence, shouting \"FIRE\" in a crowded theater, and more. Our society is already constructed with rules about who can say what to whom when, based on the context and the content of the message. Considering that hate speech is inherently harmful and always acts to justify other harmful acts against the targeted victims, and it becomes pretty obvious that it does not deserve the same level of free speech protections in the legal sphere. And furthermore, when you're in the private sphere (and Reddit is a private space) the people in charge have every right to decide for themselves what can and cannot be said. If you say something racist and get banned for it, that's not an \"infringement of your free speech\", that's just someone being tired of your bullshit and kicking you out.", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "wikipedia", "date_year_month": "2019-02", "created_utc_converted": "2019-02-07 12:54:55", "score_overall": 7, "words": "jewish jew jewish holocaust jewish silencing libel", "shared_words": "jewish jew holocaust silencing libel", "socre_distint": 5}

If, therefore, someone says to you that both cities are destroyed, do not believe him. Similarly, if he says to you that they are both settled in tranquility, do not believe him. If, however, he says to you that Caesarea is destroyed and Jerusalem is settled, or that Jerusalem is destroyed and Caesarea is settled, believe him. As it is stated: \u201cBecause Tyre has said against Jerusalem: Aha, the gates of the people have been broken; she is turned to me; I shall be filled with her that is laid waste\u201d (Ezekiel 26:2), and Tyre, like Caesarea, represents Rome. Consequently, the verse indicates that if this city is filled, that one is laid waste, and if that city is filled, this one is laid waste. The two cities cannot coexist. *Megillah 6a*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"The People of the Earth are idolaters, and it has been written about them: *Let them be wiped off the face of the earth.

Jews tend to be the first scapegoat used to deflect that anger away from the rich and powerful.\n\nThis is how antisemitism has always functioned.\n\n[Antisemitism is the grand conspiracy theory](https://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/274001/anti-semitism-is-a-conspiracy-theory) deployed to \"explain\" why people suffer and redirect revolutionary activity away from real change. Antisemitism is framed by antisemites as \"punching up.\" The core antisemitic belief is that Jews - some Jews, all Jews, a cabal of Jews, Jewish bankers, Jewish scholars, Jewish diplomats, the Jewish state - is seen as an omnimalevolent force that oppresses the world.

Concerning how black antisemitism is construced, the following 1967 article is illustrative: [\"*Negroes Are Anti-Semitic Because They're Anti-White*\"](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/29/specials/baldwin-antisem.html). Jews are scapegoated as the \"white oppressor\" by those who are oppressed by antiblack racism. Instead of attacking the system that perpetuates racism - or even just attacking the racists that created, profit from, and want to continue the system of racism in America - poor black Americans are directed to attack Jews. Jews are made into symbols of white supremacy.\n\nFarrakhan is an example (not the only one) of a modern community leader in black America that engages in this form of antisemitism.

{"author": "hecate37", "body": "So much for the kindergarteners, let's hear from the Ph.D.'s on why it's not good when your leaders joke about this. \n\nThe 10 Stages of Genocide:\n\nGenocide is a process that develops in ten stages that are predictable but not inexorable. At each stage, preventive measures can stop it. The process is not linear. Stages may occur simultaneously. Logically, later stages must be preceded by earlier stages.  But all stages continue to operate throughout the process.\n\n1. CLASSIFICATION: All cultures have categories to distinguish people into \u201cus and them\u201d by ethnicity, race, religion, or nationality: German and Jew, Hutu and Tutsi. Bipolar societies that lack mixed categories, such as Rwanda and Burundi, are the most likely to have genocide. The main preventive measure at this early stage is to develop universalistic institutions that transcend ethnic or racial divisions, that actively promote tolerance and understanding, and that promote classifications that transcend the divisions. The Catholic church could have played this role in Rwanda, had it not been riven by the same ethnic cleavages as Rwandan society. Promotion of a common language in countries like Tanzania has also promoted transcendent national identity. This search for common ground is vital to early prevention of genocide.\n\n2. SYMBOLIZATION: We give names or other symbols to the classifications. We name people \u201cJews\u201d or \u201cGypsies\u201d, or distinguish them by colors or dress; and apply the symbols to members of groups. Classification and symbolization are universally human and do not necessarily result in genocide unless they lead to  dehumanization. When combined with hatred, symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of pariah groups: the yellow star for Jews under Nazi rule, the blue scarf for people from the Eastern Zone in Khmer Rouge Cambodia. To combat symbolization, hate symbols can be legally forbidden (swastikas) as can hate speech. Group marking like gang clothing or tribal scarring can be outlawed, as well. The problem is that legal limitations will fail if unsupported by popular cultural enforcement. Though Hutu and Tutsi were forbidden words in Burundi until the 1980\u2019s, code words replaced them. If widely supported, however, denial of symbolization can be powerful, as it was in Bulgaria, where the government refused to supply enough yellow badges and at least eighty percent of Jews did not wear them, depriving the yellow star of its significance as a Nazi symbol for Jews.\n\n3. DISCRIMINATION: A dominant group uses law, custom, and political power to deny the rights of other groups.  The powerless group may not be accorded full civil rights or even citizenship. Examples include the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 in Nazi Germany, which stripped Jews of their German citizenship, and prohibited their employment by the government and by universities.  Denial of citizenship to the Rohingya Muslim minority in Burma is another example.  Prevention against discrimination means full political empowerment and citizenship rights for all groups in a society.  Discrimination on the basis of nationality, ethnicity, race or religion should be outlawed.  Individuals should have the right to sue the state, corporations, and other individuals if their rights are violated.\n\n4. DEHUMANIZATION: One group denies the humanity of the other group. Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects or diseases. Dehumanization overcomes the normal human revulsion against murder. At this stage, hate propaganda in print and on hate radios is used to vilify the victim group. In combating this dehumanization, incitement to genocide should not be confused with protected speech. Genocidal societies lack constitutional protection for countervailing speech, and should be treated differently than democracies. Local and international leaders should condemn the use of hate speech and make it culturally unacceptable. Leaders who incite genocide should be banned from international travel and have their foreign finances frozen. Hate radio stations should be shut down, and hate propaganda banned. Hate crimes and atrocities should be promptly punished.\n\n5. ORGANIZATION: Genocide is always organized, usually by the state, often using militias to provide deniability of state responsibility (the Janjaweed in Darfur.) Sometimes organization is informal (Hindu mobs led by local RSS militants) or decentralized (terrorist groups.) Special army units or militias are often trained and armed. Plans are made for genocidal killings. To combat this stage, membership in these militias should be outlawed. Their leaders should be denied visas for foreign travel. The U.N. should impose arms embargoes on governments and citizens of countries involved in genocidal massacres, and create commissions to investigate violations, as was done in post-genocide Rwanda.\n\n6. POLARIZATION: Extremists drive the groups apart. Hate groups broadcast polarizing propaganda. Laws may forbid intermarriage or social interaction. Extremist terrorism targets moderates, intimidating and silencing the center. Moderates from the perpetrators\u2019 own group are most able to stop genocide, so are the first to be arrested and killed. Prevention may mean security protection for moderate leaders or assistance to human rights groups. Assets of extremists may be seized, and visas for international travel denied to them. Coups d\u2019\u00e9tat by extremists should be opposed by international sanctions.\n\n7.  PREPARATION:  National or perpetrator group leaders plan the \u201cFinal Solution\u201d to the Jewish, Armenian, Tutsi or other targeted group \u201cquestion.\u201d  They often use euphemisms to cloak their intentions, such as referring to their goals as \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d \u201cpurification,\u201d or \u201ccounter-terrorism.\u201d  They build armies, buy weapons and train their troops and militias.  They indoctrinate the populace with fear of the victim group.  Leaders often claim that \u201cif we don\u2019t kill them, they will kill us.\u201d  Prevention of preparation may include arms embargos and commissions to enforce them.  It should include prosecution of incitement and conspiracy to commit genocide, both crimes under Article 3 of the Genocide Convention.\n\n8. PERSECUTION: Victims are identified and separated out because of their ethnic or religious identity. Death lists are drawn up. In state sponsored genocide, members of victim groups may be forced to wear identifying symbols. Their property is often expropriated. Sometimes they are even segregated into ghettoes, deported into concentration camps, or confined to a famine-struck region and starved.  Genocidal massacres begin.  They are acts of genocide because they intentionally destroy part of a group.  At this stage, a Genocide Emergency must be declared. If the political will of the great powers, regional alliances, or the U.N. Security Council can be mobilized, armed international intervention should be prepared, or heavy assistance provided to the victim group to prepare for its self-defense. Humanitarian assistance should be organized by the U.N. and private relief groups for the inevitable tide of refugees to come.\n\n9. EXTERMINATION begins, and quickly becomes the mass killing legally called \u201cgenocide.\u201d It is \u201cextermination\u201d to the killers because they do not believe their victims to be fully human. When it is sponsored by the state, the armed forces often work with militias to do the killing. Sometimes the genocide results in revenge killings by groups against each other, creating the downward whirlpool-like cycle of bilateral genocide (as in Burundi). At this stage, only rapid and overwhelming armed intervention can stop genocide. Real safe areas or refugee escape corridors should be established with heavily armed international protection. (An unsafe \u201csafe\u201d area is worse than none at all.) The U.N. Standing High Readiness Brigade, EU Rapid Response Force, or regional forces -- should be authorized to act by the U.N. Security Council if the genocide is small. For larger interventions, a multilateral force authorized by the U.N. should intervene. If the U.N. is paralyzed, regional alliances must act. It is time to recognize that the international responsibility to protect transcends the narrow interests of individual nation states. If strong nations will not provide troops to intervene directly, they should provide the airlift, equipment, and financial means necessary for regional states to intervene.\n\n10. DENIAL is the final stage that lasts throughout and always follows a genocide. It is among the surest indicators of further genocidal massacres. The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves, burn the bodies, try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses. They deny that they committed any crimes, and often blame what happened on the victims. They block investigations of the crimes, and continue to govern until driven from power by force, when they flee into exile. There they remain with impunity, like Pol Pot or Idi Amin, unless they are captured and a tribunal is established to try them. The response to denial is punishment by an international tribunal or national courts. There the evidence can be heard, and the perpetrators punished. Tribunals like the Yugoslav or Rwanda Tribunals, or an international tribunal to try the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, or an International Criminal Court may not deter the worst genocidal killers. But with the political will to arrest and prosecute them, some may be brought to justice.\n\nhttp://www.genocidewatch.org/genocide/tenstagesofgenocide.html", "score": 7, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "politics", "date_year_month": "2019-02", "created_utc_converted": "2019-02-10 18:29:30", "score_overall": 4, "words": "jew silencing jewish conspiracy", "shared_words": "jew silencing jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}
{"author": "ratatatar", "body": "I find it insulting that you can assume most of the things I think about Trump is a symptom of the media, not knowing what I think for the most part.  That seems like a tired scapegoat to avoid engaging the specific concepts.  I don't care what the media thinks.  I don't watch mainstream media, although I'm sure it does have some effect since no one is immune to propaganda.\n\n\"unless you are willing to understand what cognitive dissonance means\" - this is insulting as well.  Why do you think I am... unwilling to understand what cognitive dissonance means?  Does that even make sense re-reading it?  Does anyone will themselves to understand something?\n\nI checked out factba.se, thanks a lot for the link.  I've been watching these vlogs from Trump, odd that he deleted most of them... but they're in line with what I've heard him say at rallies and the rare press briefing when he isn't cornered between flights... I'm sorry, but so far it isn't changing my opinion of him.  He seems to say all the same things, lots of hyperbole about how terrible the things he doesn't like are and how great he is - without any data or in-depth explanation.  Just face-value take-him-at-his-word platitudes.  To me, it sounds like if you were writing satire of a cheap politician - making false promises and telling half-truths to gain support.\n\nI worry that you're as likely to be deluded as you accuse me - anything negative of Trump has become so saturated and ubiquitous everywhere you look, that you start to doubt it.t.  I don't know how you would be able to tell it from the truth, though.  Everyone takes gravity for granted, everyone sees that the Catholic church has a surprising amount of child abuse, everyone knows that politics are corrupt and bribery is rampant through campaign contributions and lobbyists.  Do you think none of these are true because they're so popular of opinions?\n\n\"Even if you don't agree with his stance on global warming\"\n\nHe's had multiple stances, and has never admitted that he was wrong.  He sounds like a classic bullshitter, and I've been around a lot of them through school and in business.  The vagueness is intentional.  Is climate change a Chinese hoax?  Is the overwhelming majority of the scientific community and NASA all in on a massive conspiracy to destroy the economy they rely on for their quality of life, grants, and paychecks?  Do you think people dedicated to finding hard truths and who rely on reputation atop a precarious position where they are incentivized to prove one another wrong constantly would decide to lie and forge immensely complicated data and models?\n\nI find all of that absurdly unlikely, and I think that issue alone - regardless of the implications but the truth of the matter, the arrogance, and the hypocrisy of the president completely antithetical to that of any sort of leader.  It's immediately disqualifying.  \"I don't know, but I doubt it\" would have been a perfectly acceptable stance about climate change.  Instead, it was \"I know for certain it's all made up.\"  Then when challenged, it's slowly evolved into \"OK it's real but other countries do more and it would hurt our economy too much and maybe people aren't causing it that much and maybe it'll go back the other way because it goes like this *literally makes hand-waiving gestures*\"\n\nThis is cartoonish.  It is the epitome of dishonesty, ignorance, arrogance, and immorality.  None of this was fed to me by \"the media\" I watched his talks on the matter without any commentary, in context, and in full.  Commentary is completely unnecessary.\n\nI don't know what your motivations are, but I want you to ask yourself what they are - I don't need to know, but ask if you have any reason you want Trump to succeed that doesn't have to do with his competence or his platform.  If you think illegal immigration is really the crisis he claims, why have we been thriving for decades with similar levels of illegal immigration?  What data are you basing your opinion of \"crisis\" on?\n\n\"Then principals of cognitive dissonance keep you there volunarily.\"\n\nPrinciples* I think you mean.  Are you suggesting people who have internally conflicting ideas are more likely to keep watching and agree with the media's portrayal of Trump?  Typically cognitive dissonance is thought to be uncomfortable - why would people who disagree with the portrayal of Trump be more enticed to listen?  What is the source of the dissonance you're suggesting?  Are you suggesting that people think Trump is a good guy with good ideas and the media's portrayal of the opposite makes them fascinated?  I can tell you it's not at all the case with me, so perhaps your characterization does not apply here.\n\nI've spent time in T_D.  I saw people reveling in the death of John McCain.  I think he made some inexcusable mistakes, I would say I dislike him strongly as a politician.  But even with how much I dislike Trump and Hillary, I wouldn't gloat over their death.  I also witnessed a lot of blame thrown toward the \"Jews\" whoever they are, is it all Jews or just a select few?  Is being Jewish a prerequisite to be in the illuminati or whatever organization is suggested is pulling the strings or can you pledge allegiance?  If the latter, why call them Jews?  These conspiracies open more questions than they answer and, like your suggestions about the media and scientific consensus being compromised and corrupt (toward what end I'm not sure, Republicans hold immense power and always have - are they really so incompetent that they do not have their own secret societies or are incapable of exposing the scary liberal ones?)  I also saw a lot of \"we need to protect the white race\" rhetoric.  Do you personally just ignore all that and think it has nothing to do with the supporters as a whole?  I suppose I've seen a handful of people who actually claim to be communist in liberal subreddits, but they're usually mocked.  I can't say I can find something on par with wanting racial purity in the country on the left.  Maybe the idiots who think black people can't be racist?  They're summarily mocked, as well... unlike T_D from my experience.\n\nNone of this holds up to even a second-degree level of inquiry.  It may sound sexy, and it may validate preconceived bias, but it answers no questions about reality and it doesn't match up.  I used to talk shit in /r/politics all the time, about how shit Hillary was and how ineffective Dems are in general, and I was never \"kicked out\" - whereas I was banned from T_D for asking a question about what was conservative about increasing the budget and what the plan was for Obamacare.  I didn't even say it shitty, it was a question.  The more reasonable posters \n\nSo I'm sorry, but your picture doesn't match reality.  I'm concerned you already knew this and are perpetuating a misinformation campaign.  If not, I'm severely concerned that we may live in completely separate realities.\n\nI don't want your money.  No amount of money can convince me to believe something that isn't convincing on its own right.\n\nI brought up the deficit because \"conservatives\" have been complaining about it for ages - it's the basis of the \"liberals want bigger government\" critique, and one of the issues I agree with them on.  I was looking forward to having a conservative government which would reduce our bloated spending and reduce the deficit.  Instead, the last two conservative governments have:\n- waged decades long unjustified wars in the middle east costing TRILLIONS\n- Cut taxes (mostly on billionaires and supporting industries which in turn fund their campaigns, both R and D - morality of taxes aside, this is handing out money to people who won't even notice, not the middle class, although they tossed some scraps their way too so that they weren't technically lying)  this is nothing more than our government paying back/off private companies and citizens in exchange for direct monetary support and the promise of jobs in their constituent states.  R's and D's do this, but R's claim to be for limited government.  This is a disgusting hypocrisy I hope you're not falling for.\n- Increased government spending\n\nI'm sick of it.  I keep being told to keep an open mind and give them a chance.  It's been decades now.  I'm still keeping an open mind, and I think talking with NK and China are positives from the administration, although it's painfully clear they didn't have a cohesive plan going into it - they're shooting from the hip.  It's unprofessional, unlikely to be successful, and frankly embarrassing.\n\nI work in a professional environment and if anyone attempted projects the way this admin has, they would be fired or reassigned swiftly.  I don't say this out of some misinterpretation from \"the media.\"\n\nYou haven't remotely convinced me, and I hope you seriously consider what I've said here.  I think the media is off the rails, but it's functioning as intended - it gives the people what they want, and it serves its shareholders first and foremost.  If you'd like to discuss what we might do to reduce that influence, you might find yourself in un-patriotic territory according to Trump and Republicans especially.\n\nTrump claims to be devoutly Christian but also has never asked God for forgiveness.  He fundamentally doesn't understand what Christianity is about.  Trump complained about Obama taking vacations and golfing and has already surpassed the two-term president in his first 2 years.  He's a political mercenary for hire, who bends whichever way the wind (and money) blows.  I cannot believe any honest, intelligent American would support him if they aren't in their own bubble of misinformation.\n\nThanks for the discussion, and your earnest attempt to provide unbiased information.  I'll spend some more time on factba.se but I suggest you avoid shitposting cesspools like /r/politics and T_D like I do.

The Forward does real damage to Jews.\n\nPpl who say \"Omar criticizes Saudi Arabia. Does that make her Islamophobic?\" The only reason she criticizes Saudi Arabia is bc they committed the crime of cooperating with Israel. Does she criticize Iran? Assad? Hezbollah? Killing 450,000 civilians doesn't draw her ire but KSA and Israel do? And you think that's legit?\n\nThe implication that politicians support Israel bc of Jewish money rather than bc Israel is our ally with aligned interests and values is obscene. If it was as simple as just buying politicians Arab oil money would just buy them all. This isn't rocket science.\n\nI'm not even that offended by saying Israel hypnotized the world or what she said today. It's more what it represents - the Arab-Muslim obsession with Israel. And yes, it's bc Israel is Jewish. If Israeli Jews had been Muslims there'd have been no problem.

{"author": "hahabones", "body": "&gt;cultural marxism\n\n&gt;In contemporary usage, the term **Cultural Marxism identifies an anti-semitic conspiracy theory that misrepresents the Frankfurt School intellectuals as part of continual academic and intellectual efforts to undermine and destroy Western culture**, then to be replaced with Marxist culture. In the late 1990s, Cultural Marxism claimed that the Frankfurt School were in a culture-war conspiracy against the Western world, to be realised by undermining traditionalist conservatism with the social liberalism of the Counterculture of the 1960s, such as the social equality of progressive politics, the racial equality of multiculturalism, and linguistic political correctness.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School#Cultural_Marxism_conspiracy_theory\n\n\n&gt;Talking about the Frankfurt School is ideal for not naming the Jews as a group (which often leads to a panicky rejection, a stubborn refusal to listening anymore and even a \"shut up\") but naming the Jew by proper names. People will make their generalizations by themselves - in the privacy of their own minds. At least it worked like that with me. It was my lightbulb moment, when confusing pieces of an alarming puzzle suddenly grouped to a visible picture. Learn by heart the most important proper names of the Frankfurt Schoolers - they are (except for a handful of minor members and female \"groupies\") ALL Jews. One can even quite innocently mention that the Frankfurt Schoolers had to leave Germany in 1933 because \"they were to a man, Jewish,\" as William S. Lind does.\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20111124045123/http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/backissues/168-169/martin-jay-frankfurt-school-as-scapegoat.cfm\n\nIf you don\u2019t trust either of those sources, I got a passage straight from Stormfront:\n\n&gt;A few blocks from the Frankfurt School, I stumbled across a homage to the radical Marxist Theodor Adorno (originally Theodor Wiesengrund).

{"author": "VapesOnAPlane", "body": "1. Show me a suicide bomber in the last few decades that was not Muslim. Please provide more than three examples. There have been thousands of suicide bombs over the last few decades. You will need more than 3 examples to show a pattern/trend. Otherwise, yes ALL suicide bombers were Muslim. This is a fact. Whether or not you choose to accept that is not my fault.\n2. \"All of the terrorism in the world, **specifically targeting other people based on their faith**, is done by Muslims...in the name of Allah.\" Please note the bolded text. I specifically put that in their for a reason. \"Specifically targeting other people based on their faith.\" There is no other group of people in the world who belong to another religion that are **killing** others based on their religion...except for the Muslims. I'm not talking about governments either...because yes, what the government of China is doing now to Muslims is wrong. I, however, was talking about individuals, because that's what the argument was about...individuals part of a certain religion, not just governments, wanting death upon other ethnic/national groups. You won't find random Chinese civilians killing Muslims. You won't find Russian civilians killing Jews. Etc. etc.\n3. Again, I am not disagreeing with you about other people hating Jews throughout history. I had mentioned in a previous post of mine the primary reason for this Jew hatred and Jew killing throughout history (because Jews were educated and extremely successful while the masses were not...that led to jealousy). My point was that in the past 100 years, anti-Semitism has drastically declined compared to what it used to be. Furthermore, killings of Jews by people other than Muslims is **extremely rare**. Muslims, however, seem to continue to excel at this. And, this isn't just political. It's part of the Muslim culture. Since you didn't read an article I linked to a few posts ago, I'll copy/paste the last 2 paragraphs:\n\n\"We can then travel back even further before the very beginning of the Zionist movement, to the Damascus affair and the blood libel of 1840. And we find contemporary \u2018mob attacks on Jewish communities throughout the Middle East\u2019. We also find Jews were being murdered throughout the 19th century, just for being Jews, in Aleppo (1850, 1875), in Damascus (1840, 1848, 1890), in Beirut (1862, 1874), in Dayr al-Qamar (1847), in Jaffa (1876), in Jerusalem (1847, 1870 and 1895), in Cairo (1844, 1890), in Mansura (1877), in Alexandria (1870, 1882), and in Damanhur (1871, 1873, 1877, 1891). Each and every one before the first Zionist congress took place in 1897.\n\nBefore the partition, before Israel, before the settlements, before the \u2018occupation\u2019, before the refugees, before Sharon walked onto Temple Mount, before the \u2018wall\u2019, before immigration, before Balfour and before even Zionism itself. In the beginning there was an Arab with a knife and he murdered a Jew, simply because he was a Jew. It is an absurd logic that attempts to blame Zionism for creating violence against Jews when modern Zionism \\*only came about\\* because of relentless violence against Jews; both in Europe and in the Middle East. You cannot place the cart before the horse. Enough with the excuses.\"\n\nAs for Jewish living under Muslim rule: I never said there was widespread Jewish execution (like on the scale of the Holocaust). However, there were frequent pogroms where many Jews did die and also Jews lived as second class citizens. This very much contributed to the culture of Jew hatred among Muslims. Jews living as second class citizens is directly because of the Qu'ran and has nothing to do with politics. It's the religion itself as I mentioned in a previous post.\n\nRegarding your question: as I have already stated, the ONLY way that will happen is if Muslims reform their religion, like everyone else did already. I won't care about what Islam/the Qu'ran says about Jews because the Muslim people wouldn't act on what is said or implied in their scripture. The Qu'ran could say \"go out and kill Jews\" but if no one listens, I wouldn't care. I'll have a very positive image of Muslims and you won't hear me complaining. The Talmud says some pretty messed up stuff but you don't see Jews going out and killing goyim.\n\nRegarding other Arab/Muslim countries opinion towards Jews: A) you give 3 examples out of dozens of Muslims states. Congrats. B) I have close Jewish friends who have family in Morocco. Yes, the King is nice to the Jews but the opinion **on the street** is not favorable towards Jews. There is a small minority of Muslims who either like or have no opinion of Jews. The majority hate Jews...and it has nothing to do with Israel or politics (as can be seen by the 2 paragraphs above that I copy/pasted).", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Israel", "date_year_month": "2019-02", "created_utc_converted": "2019-02-12 21:34:10", "score_overall": 12, "words": "jew jew libel jewish jew jew jewish jewish holocaust jew goyim jewish", "shared_words": "jew libel jewish holocaust goyim", "socre_distint": 5}

I for one believe in the two state solution and I don\u2019t think rubber stamping every stupid thing Netanyahu does is good policy for Israel\u2019s long term relationship with its neighbors. \n\nAnd I agree with many that AIPAC is sometimes guilty of labeling people who reasonably disagree with Israel\u2019s policies anti-Semitic. \n\nBUT there are a couple of recent cases where I believe opposing Israel\u2019s policies rise to the level of antisemitism. I\u2019ll get to those in a minute, but first a couple of facts.\n\nFor one thing the state of Israel was founded as a Jewish state as a way to ensure that the horrors of the holocaust were not repeated. Israel\u2019s founding documents intrinsically call it a Jewish state and there are certain rights that only Jewish citizens have. However generally nonJews have all the rights of non Jews. People who say Israel does not equal Jews and Jews do not equal Israel have no fucking idea what they\u2019re talking about. Sure, many Jews oppose Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians, but Israel is our Vatican. It\u2019s our ancestral homeland and the seat of our religion. \n\nFor another thing, our faith regards that land as our ancestral homeland. We have been living in diaspora for 2000 years but Israel is very much our home. You can\u2019t dig a hole in the ground without finding a star if David. People who say that religion and ethnicity aren\u2019t tied together don\u2019t understand that Jews historically don\u2019t marry outside the faith and don\u2019t prosteletize like other faiths. I just had my 23 and me test and I\u2019m 97% ashkenazi jew. I\u2019m not that unusual. Many Jews can literally trace our roots back to the blood line of Aaron from the Bible, Like it or not, Jews come from one place and that\u2019s the land occupied by Israel. \n\nSo back to the antisemitism question. Part of being Jewish is learning about antisemitism. It has existed forever, but really modern day antisemitism has its roots in 14th and 15th century Europe. A handful of Jewish families got into international banking. Some of them became extremely wealthy on par with the vast wealth of entire kingdoms. This is oversimplifying things, but basically a handful of European monarchs became heavily indebted to these families and it had major political implications for their nations. Wracked with huge amounts of debt the monarchs needed a scapegoat and they conveniently settled on the Jews.\n\nCountries like Spain and Portugal basically persecuted, murdered and exiled the Jews out of their countries to avoid repaying these staggering debts. Many Jews moved Eastward to Germany, Poland and Russia where they attempted to live isolated lives in their own villages to avoid persecution. They were met with Pogroms etc. \n\nSeemingly whenever some prick monarch needed to point a finger as to why people were starving or there was sickness etc it was always the Jews. We were different. We looked different. We are different, But one recurring theme of persecution throughout our history has been about how Jews and our money ruin things for good righteous hardworking Christians. How Jews aren\u2019t patriotic and use money insidious ways to subvert order and etc etc etc, never mind the fact that the VAST majority of Jews were peasants, farmers, tradesman etc. \n\n[A historical note- Israel was actually originally populated with Jewish communists. Jews were actually very early ideological proponents of the same socialist principles that people like AOC espouse today,]\n\nAnyway for centuries Jews have been terrorized with these baseless accusations of using money to subvert national order culminating with the holocaust when things finally reached a breaking point, Finally the world decided that the Jews had suffered enough and the UN voted to create a Jewish state in their ancestral homeland. \n\n Fast forwarding to the present. When a vocal critic of Israel (our beloved homeland) basically accuses Israel\u2019s lobby of bribing American officials and says \u201c It\u2019s all about the Benjamin\u2019s\u201d you\u2019ll forgive us if we don\u2019t hear the common tried and trusted dog whistle of anti-semitism.\n\nThe thing you need to understand is that while it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to criticize Israel\u2019s treatment of the Palestinians, it\u2019s is facile and demonstrably wrong to fail to acknowledge that the other side carries plenty of blame for the current state of things. \n\nAnyway fwiw I don\u2019t believe Ilhan Omar is an antisemite, I think she\u2019s great. I donated some of my Jewish money to her during her campaign and look forward to giving more in two years.\n\n", "score": 48, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "politics", "date_year_month": "2019-02", "created_utc_converted": "2019-02-13 04:09:30", "score_overall": 13, "words": "jew jewish holocaust jewish jewish jew jewish jewish scapegoat jewish holocaust jewish jewish", "shared_words": "jew jewish holocaust scapegoat", "socre_distint": 4}
{"author": "melechshelyat", "body": "This answer is horrible.\n\n&gt;1.  Holocaust made the world realize that yes, Jews are just humans like the rest of us.  Many nations denied jewish refugees for unknown reasons.  Some speculate anti-jewish sentiment, others point out that Zionists were secretly asking governments (such as the US) to deny refugees, because they needed the warm bodies in Palestine. The collective shame about the genocide caused (2).  \n\nThis is a myth. We know exactly why Jews were turned away. [The State Department and FDR](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/us-government-turned-away-thousands-jewish-refugees-fearing-they-were-nazi-spies-180957324/) said they were a threat to \u201cnational security\u201d. They claimed Nazi agents would infiltrate the US as Jewish refugees. They were [openly antisemitic](https://m.jpost.com/Diaspora/FDR-wanted-Jews-spread-thin-and-kept-out-of-US-documents-reveal-553336), with FDR saying he thought the best way to handle Jews after WWII was to make sure they were spread out all over the world and couldn\u2019t centralize.\n\nHe straight up said that [the Germans had legitimate complaints](http://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/07/opinion/la-oe-medoff-roosevelt-holocaust-20130407) against Jews during WWII, and that Jews should be restricted in the jobs they could do to avoid \u201covercrowding\u201d the jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s not speculation. It\u2019s what the government did and believed. Zionist leaders didn\u2019t ask the US to keep out Jews. The US was doing that all on its own.\n\nBefore the Holocaust\u2019s extent was known, Zionist leaders urged that countries allow Jews to flee to what became Israel. They never told countries not to admit people, not when the Holocaust was understood. And most countries had been rejecting Jews long before that became public.\n\n&gt;2.  For lack of a better term, \"the guilt of the collective consciousness\" created a majority opinion in the newly-created UN to secure a homeland for jews, so that this couldn't happen again.\n\nWe can\u2019t know how much difference it made, but support was already quite widespread before WWII. The UN sent a committee to study the issue, which came up with the same solution that the British had proposed 10 years prior, in 1937, before the war.\n\n&gt;At the same time, campaigns to move jews out of Russian pogroms / territories and other nations began in earnest.  Various incentives were offered.\n\nNo, they didn\u2019t. Pogroms occurred far earlier in earnest.\n\n&gt;4.  The Palestinians protested.  Since arabs and jews have history of conflict, they foresaw the ingress of others to be a displacement.  Sound familiar? (see also Trump, the wall, Brexit)\n\nDude, what? The Palestinians (a term that back then referred to Jews too) didn\u2019t protest. When the UN passed this partition plan, they did what they\u2019d done in 1920-1947: rioted. This time it turned into a civil war. Arabs rejected the idea of two states for two peoples, while Zionist Jews accepted it.\n\n&gt; The US was all-in for Israel as a permanent strategic outpost a la UK. \n\nNo it wasn\u2019t. The US was actually supplying the Arabs with weapons. It was the Soviets who, through Czechoslovakia, provided the weapons that helped Israel survive. The US implemented an arms embargo, but kept supplying Arab states in accordance with prior contracts. This harmed Israel, not helped it.\n\nThe US didn\u2019t become a major Israeli ally until decades later. It tried to woo the Arabs.\n\n&gt;Many wars happened, including the last major one in 1967 called the Six Day War.\n\nThe last major one? What happened in 1973, with the Yom Kippur War? Did Lebanon not happen in 1982?\n\n&gt; Their allies all lost land: Israel captures and occupies the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.\n\nYou left out how those countries got that land: invading Israel in 1948.\n\n&gt;6.  Fast forward a generation: Arafat personified the freedom fighter for self determination for the Palestinians. \n\nIt\u2019s not a generation beyond 1967. He took over Fatah and much of the Palestinian movement by 1969.\n\n&gt;People like Sharon and Netanyahu personified self-preservation of the Israelis.\n\nHow do you entirely skip over Yitzhak Rabin, Ehud Barak, and Shimon Peres? Do you know anything of what you\u2019re talking about?\n\n&gt;Israel has created open-air ghettoes out of most of the remaining Palestinian land.\n\nOpen-air ghettoes is an oxymoron. It also doesn\u2019t make sense. Israel blockades only Gaza, not the West Bank. It began the blockade in 2007, after withdrawing from Gaza entirely two years earlier. In response to the withdrawal, Hamas (dedicated to wiping out Jews FYI) won elections and took over Gaza, at which point the blockade began.\n\n&gt; Imagine both perspectives: Israel rips up 500 year old olive grove your family has held for generations, then builds mid-rise condos for people to \"settle\" your land. \n\nHow is this \u201cboth perspectives\u201d? Pretty weird. Especially since what you leave out is that most groves are actually not ones your family owns, has held, or all that old at all. Most of this land is empty and unused.\n\n&gt;This is what the U.S. did to the Native Americans, and it's 100% effective.\n\nThe US literally wiped out Natives when they could. Israel has provided Gaza, run by Hamas, with more water and electricity than they pay for or are entitled to under treaties they signed, they have offered peace deals in 2000, 2001, 2008, all of which Palestinians refused, and they literally are facing down millions of people who want to wipe out Jews. Almost half of Palestinians (though not all of course) say in polls that they support killing civilians.\n\n&gt;7.  The Occupied Territories are encircled and controlled. They have their ports of entry controlled by their enemy.\n\nThat is in fact how it works. When you begin a war, and lose it, this tends to happen until you accept peace.\n\n&gt;8.  Opposing Israel today is conflated with being against jews.\n\nNo it isn\u2019t. People complain about this all the time. It isn\u2019t the same.\n\nCalling to destroy Israel is antisemitism. That\u2019s because it would mean taking away a right guaranteed by international law called self-determination from Jews. As the UN Secretary General explained, that\u2019s antisemitic.\n\nCriticizing Israeli policies isn\u2019t antisemitic. Only the fringes argue otherwise. The fringes on the other side claim Jews are terrible and are straight up antisemitic. We don\u2019t treat the fringes as representative for a reason.\n\n&gt;That's the Israeli strategy: perpetrate crime, and declare yourself re-victimized under the cover of the holocaust, ethically speaking.\n\nThis is just conspiracy theory at this point.\n\n&gt;However, anti-jew forces are all over the place, many of them functioning as hate-cults.  Anti-jewish sentiment is real, and bad.  It deserves to be combatted, if you are moral/ethical.  So does what Israel is doing to the Palestinian people, again, if you are moral/ethical.\n\nWhat deserves to be combated is the constant and unrelenting attempt to claim Israel is doing anything to the Palestinian people. It is defending itself, full stop. If the Palestinian leaders want the war to end, they need only accept one of the many peace offers that have been on the table.\n\n&gt;Peace is impossible, so all the weapons manufacturers play both sides and we get a slow genocide in our lifetimes... This time, perpetrated by the same people who survived the last genocide.\n\nYeah, this is antisemitic too. Claiming Jews are Nazis is antisemitic as heck. It\u2019s disgusting, dehumanizing, and it diminishes what the Nazis did by comparison.\n\n[This](https://israelipalestinian.procon.org/files/1-israeli-palestinian-images/west-bank-and-gaza-strip-arab-population-1948-to-2005.gif) is the exact opposite of a \u201cslow genocide\u201d.\n\n&gt;Fun fact: \"anti-semitic\" is not a useful term.  It refers to one of the tribes (Noah's children), \"Shem.\" Those are all of the jews and muslims, because Shem was Abraham's grandfather.  \n\nClassic tactic for antisemitism: try to redefine a word created by someone who hated Jews, who made the word to describe his hate for Jews.\n\nFun fact: peanuts aren\u2019t nuts. No one claims that we should change their name. Stop trying to change a word used to describe Jew hatred for peer 150 years.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t actually an antisemite, it\u2019s weird that you hit at least three of the examples of antisemitism accepted as problematic by the [US, EU, and International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/working-definition-antisemitism).

{"author": "JonWood007", "body": "Okay, so you finally really explained your perspective down to your worldview, which really helps make sense of peoples' motivations and views a lot. \n\nNow I'll explain mine. I'm an ex-Christian atheist. My views on religion are very much in line with r/atheism, although I've kinda toned down to a large extent because I've been out of religion for 7 years now. My atheism influences my political views a lot and is a huge reason I'm on the left and not the right. It also tends to make me a different kind of leftie than many other lefties. Im a bit less sensitive and tender on the political correctness side of things and kinda think we need to not mince words and dance around stuff for fear of offending people, because a huge defense mechanism religions have is to hide behind accusations of intolerance and bigotry to protect themselves. I see a lot of power structures and manipulation in religion, and my worldview also applies this to politics in general, which makes me very skeptical of those in power who wish to pull one over on us. \n\nI also show little to no bias toward israel, which is a difficult position in our society because of the majority of people subscribing to SOME judeo-christian worldview. It's not just jews in our society who are super pro israel. The evangelicals are rabidly pro israel to the point they literally think if you oppose israel you will incur the wrath of god, which they justify with bible quotes. If anything, jews get a metric crapton of preferential treatment other groups do not get on the basis of oppression, on the basis of this western judeo christian history. LIke, everyone is expected to sympathize with them and their story, but the same deference is not given to the other side. And it just comes off as a weird double standard to those who are NOT part of that judeo christian worldview. I would apply there, being a christian, and omar would, being muslim. \n\nnow, to go into and respond to various things you've said. \n\n&gt;First of all AIPAC is a very powerful lobby. It\u2019s extremely hawkish and flexes its muscles to force American politicians to line up with Israeli interests. \n\nIm glad we agree on this. Especially in this age where money in politics is a huge problem.\n\n&gt;Many liberal Jews (like myself) find AIPAC more or less reprehensible. I for one believe in the two state solution and I don\u2019t think rubber stamping every stupid thing Netanyahu does is good policy for Israel\u2019s long term relationship with its neighbors. \n\nIm glad we agree on this.\n\n&gt;BUT there are a couple of recent cases where I believe opposing Israel\u2019s policies rise to the level of antisemitism. I\u2019ll get to those in a minute, but first a couple of facts.\n\nWell it depends how you define anti semitism. I define it as hatred toward jews. \n\n&gt;For one thing the state of Israel was founded as a Jewish state as a way to ensure that the horrors of the holocaust were not repeated. Israel\u2019s founding documents intrinsically call it a Jewish state and there are certain rights that only Jewish citizens have. However generally nonJews have all the rights of non Jews. People who say Israel does not equal Jews and Jews do not equal Israel have no fucking idea what they\u2019re talking about. Sure, many Jews oppose Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians, but Israel is our Vatican. It\u2019s our ancestral homeland and the seat of our religion. \n\nWell, here's the thing. This isnt israel. This is america. And america is a secular country that is not to recognize an establishment of religion. We like to keep church and state separate. \n\nIsrael is mistreating some people. It seems very clear to me they are. For all the persecution they face, when the shoe is on the other foot, i don't see how they're much better than the people who oppressed them. But there seems to be a huge double standard in which they ham up their reputation of being a persecuted minority to gain sympathy while basically treating others like ****. And as someone whose worldview does not share that sympathetic religious based vision, can you blame me for wishing to treat israel like anyone else, which involves calling them out on their BS when they commit it?\n\n&gt;So back to the antisemitism question. Part of being Jewish is learning about antisemitism. It has existed forever, but really modern day antisemitism has its roots in 14th and 15th century Europe. A handful of Jewish families got into international banking. Some of them became extremely wealthy on par with the vast wealth of entire kingdoms. This is oversimplifying things, but basically a handful of European monarchs became heavily indebted to these families and it had major political implications for their nations. Wracked with huge amounts of debt the monarchs needed a scapegoat and they conveniently settled on the Jews.\n\nAnd this is where i start ****ting on other religions. I blame christianity. Christianity gets butthurt because \"the jews killed christ\", so they blame the jews for everything, because they're not christian. Easy target, and whenever some disaster happened, it must've been those darned jews, blah blah blah. Stupid superstition and crap. Like i watched something on the history channel about how christians blamed jews for the black death and started beating them to death, which was dumb. You gotta understand, from an atheist perspective, we don't really attack israel in particular, we really just criticize all religions, and christians deserve to get blamed for a lot of crap they've done. \n\nAnd the banking thing. They wouldnt do money lending because it was against their religion (christians). So they had the jews do it, which made them quite upwardly mobile. Then they attacked the jews for being bankers and being greedy, linking class warfare with anti semitism in a weird way. People are dumb like that. And honestly, I understand that history, and I think that the problem, again, goes back to religion. Christians blamed jews for freaking everything, and then they persecuted them. \n\nThat doesn't mean that in a modern context we shouldnt be criticizing lobbying efforts and money in politics when jews are involved. Especially when the modern left is anti all money in politics. It's a huge part of our worldview. Money is corrupting politics. And groups like AIPAC are part of the problem. But we can't criticize aipac or israel for lobbying the government when they're blatantly biased toward israel without being anri semitic? Look, i understand where you're coming from but there's a lot of nuance here and you can't keep hiding behind the past here. Which is what these groups are doing. people are starting to criticize our relationship with israel given their human rights abuses, starting to question the role of money in politics, and the first go to is being lumped in with alt right ***holes who have some weird crazy conspiracy worldview of \"t3h j00s\" running the world via the free masons and the banking system or some crap.\n\nLike seriously, this is kind of a defense mechanisms religions use to deflect criticism. Attacking a religious doctrine or belief is often linked with bigotry and this is intended to bully and smear people out of positions that step on certain...sacred cows so to speak. Christians do it all the time. Every time you try to stop them from teaching creationism in schools, or stop government sponsored prayer they act like we're trying to oppress them. No, we just want you to play by certain rules that have a positive benefit for humanity in general. I dont show preference to jews, but i dont believe myself biased against them. but to some that kind of equality seems like oppression. \n\n&gt;Anyway for centuries Jews have been terrorized with these baseless accusations of using money to subvert national order culminating with the holocaust when things finally reached a breaking point, Finally the world decided that the Jews had suffered enough and the UN voted to create a Jewish state in their ancestral homeland.\n\nYeah and since 1945 jews have actually been given preferential treatment. There's a ton of guilt over the holocaust and it became orthodoxy to support the jewish state, while the arab/palestinian side of the story is generally ignored by the west, which is why so many tensions exist. Combine that with the role of christianity in our politics and how it's a huge plank of evangelical christendom to support israel and yeah israel has been untouchable in politics for 70 years.\n\nHere's the thing though. This is actually...privilege. I mean, jews are like the go to oppressed group no one can criticize. And it's been that way for 70 years. But just because this is the dominant worldview, and has been by those in power for years, as society changes, our stance on israel needs to evolve with it. We are more multicultural now, and support of israel is a dominant cultural view. Muslims dont necessarily share that view, and many are entering congress. Atheists dont share that view, because we reject religion. And as we become more diverse, expect support for israel to weaken. Because the judeo christian worldview is weakening. And combine that with money in politics being seen as a problem. There's a huge awakening in this country in recent years. The kochs have been a target of the left for years. And since 2016 we're also attacking the democrats for being influenced by money. it's no secret.\n\nBut here's the thing, combine these things. You have a multicultural perspective that weakens support for israel, and you have a movement against money in politics. So we end up seeing pro israel groups under fire for manipulating debate. And you see that as anti semitic because of the past, but those of us doing it...no. we dont. \n\nIf anything, maybe we're just taking israel off a pedastal, where we want to treat them like EVERY OTHER COUNTRY. And we want to treat jews like EVERY OTHER GROUP. maybe jews have been \"privileged\" for so long that equality is starting to feel like oppression.

{"author": "hannahstohelit", "body": "Here's a comment I made on the subject a year ago, though I'm correcting some of it for mistakes and expanding on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have seen this assertion made (by Pasachoff and Littman in \"A Concise History of the Jewish People,\" and elsewhere as well, I believe). But it confuses me, as there is no documentation that I know of of the numbers of Jews who died from the Black Death, and there is no reason to believe that fewer Jews (proportionally) did in fact die from the Black Death than did Christians. That assertion was made by Christians as a justification for the persecution of Jews, as they were used as a scapegoat for the plague due to their alien status and a desire to be relieved of their monetary debts to the Jews. Several Jews are recorded as having been captured and tortured into confessions of having poisoned wells, and this was then used as justification for the murders of thousands of Jews throughout France and Germany in the years 1348-1351. After all, even the Christians never claimed that NO Jews died, something which would have been perhaps an indication of some kind of Jewish poisoning conspiracy (surely the Jews would be warned not to drink the water from these poisoned wells). They generally claimed that half the number of Jews died than did Christians- and there are no official statistics to back this up. Even Pope Clement VI issued papal bulls attesting to the Jews' innocence in causing the plague, in response to the large number of pogroms, primarily because they were dying at massive rates too.\n\nPeople usually say that the reason why Jews would have been affected more significantly is because of laws about hand washing (netilat yadayim, done in the morning and before eating bread) and because of the law to bury the dead as soon as possible. (I'm not sure if that's what you meant by \"purity laws\"- that term is more often used to describe laws related to sexual relations.) Could those have potentially saved lives? It certainly wouldn't have hurt. But it's unquestionable that none of it STOPPED Jews from dying in the plague. (Ghettos were not a factor as the first was introduced in Venice in 1516.)\n\nIt's actually quite possible (given the tiny Jewish population in Europe at the time) that more Jews died of the ensuing pogroms than of the plague, but essentially the Jewish communities of northern France and especially Germany were nearly wiped out. If you want to be macabre about it, it's possible that fewer Jews died of the plague because they were already dead of pogroms- often the pogroms preceded the arrival of the plague, as Christian townspeople, fearful that Jews might \"poison the wells,\" would preemptively attack. By the end of this period, the Jews of France and Germany were mostly either dead (of either the plague or pogroms) or beginning to move eastward toward Poland- a very significant development which led to the growth of the Eastern European Jewish community; however, some small fragments of communities still persisted and were rebuilt.\n\nSources:\n\nAnna Foa, *Jews of Europe After the Black Death*\n\nJacob Rader Marcus, *The Jew in the Medieval World: A Sourcebook*", "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "date_year_month": "2019-02", "created_utc_converted": "2019-02-14 22:41:39", "score_overall": 8, "words": "jewish scapegoat jewish conspiracy jewish jewish jewish jew", "shared_words": "jewish scapegoat conspiracy jew", "socre_distint": 4}

To the U.S. en masse, parts of non-Nazi occupied europe, and [israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel#Zionism_and_British_Mandate), plus other minor countries.

They are better than other races, but there is much difference in the subraces. Many incompatibilities. \n\nNumbers change, and records are updated. That's how keeping track of things works. In any genocide you'll see a range of deaths. Such as in soviet russia, where the death tolls are anywhere from 10 million to 100 million. It's not easy to track every dead person. It also doesn't help when israel sends it's own team to \"recheck\" the numbers, when they had already been established, the same team that reported finding \"cyanide and zyklon B\" when no other team had found either, and then asked for [even more reparations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust#Reparations), even when the agreed upon numbers were payed off. Strangely in a time when israel was struggling for money. \n\nTours through concentration camps are done backwards, to have the people end up in the start/entrance of the building, where the delousing chambers are placed, and claim them to be \"gas chambers\". [These have been thoroughly tested by many teams, nobody has been able to prove them to be anything other than delousing.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Holocaust_denial#Use_of_gas_chambers)\n\nI find this to be interesting: \n\n&gt;*The* *Institute for Historical Review* *publicly offered a reward of $50,000 for verifiable \"proof that gas chambers for the purpose of killing human beings existed at or in Auschwitz.\"* *Mel Mermelstein**, a survivor of Auschwitz, submitted* ***his own testimony*** *as proof but it was ignored. He then sued IHR in the United States and the case was subsequently settled for $50,000, plus $40,000 in damages for personal suffering. The court declared the statement that \"Jews were gassed to death at the Auschwitz Concentration Camp in Poland during the summer of 1944\" was a fact.* \n\nNow we take into consideration the fact that they could literally not afford to keep the \"gas chambers\" and the \"smoke stacks\" running 24/7, [we get ridiculous claims that are shuffled under the rug](https://a.disquscdn.com/uploads/mediaembed/images/2266/7245/original.jpg), or how about the basic logic that they needed workers and to kill off people that could be used for slave labor would have been just a waste of resources. \n\n[How about the fact that they tried peddling the \"6 million\" figure just years before?](https://nationalvanguard.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/b6c0a41ba6276c60af58f1d4df880865.jpg)\n\n[Another relevant source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5SsNCvlZoM&amp;bpctr=1550269059)\n\n(The response I find particularly humorous:  *Holocaust deniers argue that the multiple pre-World War II claims of precisely six million Jews facing extermination, like former New York Governor Martin Glynn's 1919 article \"**The Crucifixion of Jews Must Stop!**\", suggests the reported death toll is inaccurate and was invented to fit propaganda.

The Jewish population in these cities was quite small, however, so the total number of slaves they owned represented just a small fraction of the total slave population;* *Eli Faber**, a historian at New York City\u2019s John Jay College reported that in 1790, Charleston\u2019s Jews owned a total of 93 slaves, and that \u201cperhaps six Jewish families\u201d lived in Savannah in 1771.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*A number of wealthy Jews were also involved in the slave trade in the Americas, some as shipowners who imported slaves and others as agents who resold them. In the United States, Isaac Da Costa of Charleston, David Franks of Philadelphia and Aaron Lopez of Newport, Rhode Island, are among the early American Jews who were prominent in the importation and sale of African slaves. In addition, some Jews were involved in the trade in various European Caribbean colonies. Alexandre Lindo, a French-born Jew who became a wealthy merchant in Jamaica in the late 18th century, was a major seller of slaves on the island.\"*\n\n[More interesting information](http://www.jewwatch.com/jew-genocide-black-holocaust-slave-ships.html)\n\n[The total percentage of slave owners in the \"slave states\"(those succeeding from the union) was 20%.](http://civilwarcauses.org/stat.htm) But you have to keep in mind, that's just the south. Most jews lived in the north, plus those living in the south were lumped in with white slave owners, as well as black slave owners.\n\n[And again you find flat out denial of these statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_views_on_slavery#The_Secret_Relationship_Between_Blacks_and_Jews_(book))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could go on and on.

Hopefully this is alright. \n\nI know some people get annoyed when journalists are being deprived money, but in this case it is written by Dugher and I'm assuming he isn't being paid per click.\n\n-----\n\nA SENIOR Labour figure once tipped for high office is quitting the party over Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s failure to tackle anti-Semitism. Michael Dugher, 43, admits he has been close to tears watching colleagues abused by the hard-Left hate mob.\n\nWriting in The Sun on Sunday today, he says: \u201cIt pains me to see what the Labour has become.\u201d\n\nMr Dugher, a party member for nearly 30 years, served as vice-chairman in the shadow cabinet under Ed Miliband. He was also a Gordon Brown aide in No10 and the Barnsley East MP for seven years.\n\nHe writes: \u201cLabour has been the greatest force for good for working people in British history. But the Labour Party I joined no longer exists.\u201d\n\nBy Michael Dugher\n\nALMOST 28 years ago to the day, I joined the Labour Party. Next week, after almost three decades, I will be resigning my membership over the party\u2019s repeated failure to adequately tackle anti-Semitism.\n\nAll my political and adult life I have been a great friend and admirer of the Jewish community. The contribution they have made and continue to make to our country is immeasurable. The Labour Party I joined was a proud anti-racist party. Not so today.\n\nLabour\u2019s bosses and party HQ have had repeated opportunities to fix the problem they undoubtedly have with anti-Semitism \u2014 and they\u2019ve repeatedly failed to do so. Words are not enough. We need action.\n\nJeremy Corbyn has been dogged by allegations of anti-Semitism his whole political life.  His excuse always seems to be that he was \u201cpresent but not involved\u201d. That excuse just doesn\u2019t wash any more.\n\nToday, under his leadership, anti-Semites in the Labour Party are repeatedly let off with a rap on the knuckles, rather than being booted out for good.\n\nTime after time, allegations are brought to the party\u2019s attention. But too often the Jew-haters are given a free pass. Let\u2019s not forget that the Holocaust is within living memory. One of the great privileges of my life was to meet some of the inspirational survivors of the Holocaust.\n\nI\u2019ve been to Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s memorial to the victims \u2014 somewhere Jeremy Corbyn refuses to visit. I\u2019ve also visited Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland with the Holocaust Educational Trust.\n\nIt does amazing work to teach our children about how 6million Jews \u2014 two thirds of the Jewish population in Europe \u2014 were systematically murdered by the Nazis. Let\u2019s not forget that the Holocaust ended with the gas chambers, but it didn\u2019t start there.\n\nIt started with something much earlier: Anti-Semitic language and art, scapegoating and boycotting, synagogues and cemeteries being attacked, people being physically threatened and assaulted, deranged conspiracy theories and a warped view of history. We\u2019re seeing all of that again today in Britain.\n\nI joined the Labour Party, aged 15, in the working-class pit village in South Yorkshire, where I grew up. I was honoured to represent nearby Barnsley for seven years as their Member of Parliament.\n\nI was very proud to have been Labour\u2019s vice-chair and a Shadow Secretary of State under Ed Miliband and to have worked for Labour in government \u2014 including at No10 for Prime Minister Gordon Brown.\n\nThe Labour Party has been the greatest force for good for working people in British history \u2014 from the creation of the National Health Service to the National Minimum Wage.  But the Labour Party I joined no longer exists.\n\nI will continue to have lots of dear friends in the Labour Party, including many talented MPs and hard-working local councillors who are fantastically dedicated public servants. Yet in all good conscience, I can no longer justify paying subs to a party which I now regard as institutionally anti-Semitic. For too many people, it is no longer seen as the \u201cLabour Party\u201d but is seen instead as the \u201cAnti-Semitic Party\u201d.\n\nSo many of my best friends in the Jewish community have already left the party. And that\u2019s been entirely understandable. But if it is understandable why a Jewish person would feel the need to leave Labour, how can it be understandable for people like me to stay in the party?\n\nI\u2019ve fought anti-Semitism all the time I\u2019ve been a Labour member \u2014 starting out campaigning against extremism on our university campuses when I was in the NUS and Labour Students. But today, Labour simply hasn\u2019t done enough to root out the anti-Semites from its ranks, many of whom claim to be among Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s most fanatical supporters.\n\nIt made me want to cry when I saw that my good friends Ruth Smeeth and Luciana Berger \u2014 both brilliant Labour MPs and brave Jewish women \u2014 had to have police protection because of the abuse and threats they have received.\n\nBut it also makes me angry when I see the attitude of people such as Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.\n\nLuciana Berger, who is eight months pregnant, faced a motion of no confidence from her local Labour Party, including by one person who branded her a \u201cdisruptive Zionist\u201d.\n\nInstead of backing Luciana, John McDonnell demanded she prove her loyalty to Labour. These days I am no longer a Labour MP, having chosen to stand down at the last election to try to make a difference elsewhere.\n\nI have friends across the political divide, but it pains me to see what the Labour Party has become.", "score": 5, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "LabourUK", "date_year_month": "2019-02", "created_utc_converted": "2019-02-16 22:54:40", "score_overall": 11, "words": "jewish jew holocaust holocaust holocaust jewish holocaust conspiracy jewish jewish jewish", "shared_words": "jewish jew holocaust conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}
{"author": "Milkhemet_Melekh", "body": "&gt;far right Israeli lobbying in America as problematic because it is a foreign entity meddling in the affairs of another country \n\nWhat about South Korea? What about the Gulf States (collectively)? What about Japan?\n\nThose all have more money in congress right now as actual foreign investment. Japan and the Gulf States are also pretty far right, and South Korea traditionally has been involved in corruption and corporate scandals.\n\nThe vast, *vast* majority of pro-Israel lobbying is done natively by Americans on behalf of Israel. This is a proven, public fact - and the belief otherwise stems from the vile antisemitic conspiracy that Jews control the government - a shadowy cabal of agents buying out politicians, it's an old canard and one of the most prevalent. You seem to have fallen into this trap, spread unintentionally by many well-meaning people who are deceived by false leadership such as the self-designated leaders of the Womens March: their alliance with Farrakhan and the widespread enmity held for them by the wider Jewish community should be proof enough of this problem, as is Linda's \"Goysplaining\" where she lectures Jews on what is and isn't offensive to Jews, [labeling who is a \"good Jew\" and a \"bad Jew\"](https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/1096049968656408577), and throwing all sorts of bullshit (\"Zionists can't be feminists\" despite Israel being the most female-friendly and LGBT-friendly country in the Middle East, where even Israel's far-right is supportive of LGBT rights, and this isn't \"pinkwashing\" because they never use it for propaganda and to declare it as \"pinkwashing\" is to set an unreasonable standard: they do bad, they're evil; they do good, they're evil). You, however, have taken a good, and very important, step. In an age where Jewish voices are ever-increasingly marginalized, and the community feels helpless as we are ignored in favor of everyone around us defining what's important to us, who we are, what's offensive to us, at a time when non-Jews are deciding what Jewish identity is, you have actually taken a moment to listen to Jews. You have decided to ask. This is an unspeakably important step, and honestly I'm actually getting really emotional over this.\n\nIf you think there is some sort of \"Jewish power\", that there is some sort of disproportionate influence, or \"smear campaigns\", or whatever you subscribe to - and you seem to with your references to \"self-hating Jews speaking negatively of Israeli politics\", well, [this is for you](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DzTP-UDWoAEwmBs.png). A good example of where this might lie is with Corbyn, where his defenders will dip into canards like Jews controlling the media, holding double-loyalty to Israel, and working with secretive agendas to \"smear\" Corbyn in a right-wing conspiracy, and then wonder why [only 13% of British Jews supported Corbyn initially](https://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/236063/why-just-13-percent-of-british-jews-say-they-will-vote-for-labour-in-the-general-election) and why [85% of Jews are quite certain he's blatantly antisemitic](https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/1092204688638906371). On top of a very problematic history of cuddling up to *genocidal paramilitaries similar to ISIS,* it paints a bad picture. When [the Jewish experience is dismissed for political reasons](https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/1040227011036413952), it is a clear show of one's priorities - that they hate their enemies, not that they're necessarily anti-racist.\n\nIt is because of this that you actually coming to ask is so important. You're *not* dismissing the Jewish voice. You actually bothered to ask us, instead of brushing us aside for one reason or another, instead of erasing us and trying to speak over us.\n\nA certain Yair Rosenberg, a foremost expert on antisemitism and writer for *Tablet,* has a fair bit to say on this:\n\n[Article one](https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/164223/why-american-policy-is-pro-israel)\n\n[Article two](https://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/173157/israel-spent-1250-to-lobby-america-in-2013)\n\n[Tweet one](https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/1094815948199084032)\n\n[Tweet two, just read the whole thread](https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/1095008542073987077)\n\n[Tweet three](https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/1095007999469539328)\n\n[Tweet four](https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/1095008542073987077)\n\n[Tweet five](https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/1094841289697312768)\n\n[Tweet six, another thread](https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/1095014977713459201)\n\n[Tweet seven](https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/1095332239166955521)\n\n[And here's a chart showing off how Israel is actually pretty low on the list, all things considered](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DzkS8P7X0AMWL1V.jpg)\n\n\n***NOW*** to address your original question. The vast, *vast* majority of Jews are in support of Israel. Those who claim support for Israel while being antisemitic usually have some motivation for it. They may go on a logic of \"Get the Jews out of my country!\", or they may be *literally trying to bring the End of Days* by fulfilling some ancient prophecy, and sometimes they want Jews to go to Israel so they're \"all in one place\" for slaughter. To be \"anti-Israel\" is a more...*unique* stance, compared to people who claim themselves as \"anti-Zionist\". The latter is often a direct continuation of Stalinist antisemitism, where being more blatant was too Hitler-y for Stalin so he started saying \"Zionist\" instead of \"Jew\" while applying all the same racism and tropes and stereotypes and etc. that came with Classical Antisemitism. That can be seen in ramblings about \"smears\" and \"Israel lobby\" and etc. as explained earlier. Not everyone who does this is aware of its origin, nor the very hurtful impact it has on Jews and the problematic erasure of the Jewish experience it causes. To this day, the \"anti-Zionist\" excuse houses people applying medieval Blood Libel to the modern State of Israel and believing themselves whole-heartedly to be anti-racist and just standing up for the little guy in Palestine.\n\nI don't know why you'd be wholesale against Israel, though. The country was founded as a Socialist paradise, which is why most Israelis are secular today. Furthermore, it's a place where many people of different backgrounds can coexist - Ashkenazim with Sephardim with Mizrahim with Ethiopians. A full rainbow, of politics and colors and opinions, together in harmony. It's got pretty strong recognition of equality for women and LGBT, and public opinion is even stronger than its official policy in many regards. A significant amount of its policy is also dedicated to international aid in very practical ways - setting up highly productive farms in poorly developed regions, sending workers to aid in the aftermath of disasters, all without care of whether or not the country in question actually supports Israel or not. A lot of Israel's foreign policy *also* is making peace with Muslims, such as treaties with Egypt and Jordan, a ceasefire line with Syria, improving relations with UAE and Saudi Arabia (including new flights being established in previous no-fly zones), it's a huge deal. Israel also has a close partnership with Cyprus culturally and politically, and by extension to Greece as well, considering Turkey to be a large threat that it tries to contain with careful diplomacy.\n\nIsrael's also a huge backer of indigenous peoples and receives their support in turn. The struggle of Kurds is a pretty big deal for Israel, and Israel also harbors a very loyal Druze population which it holds very dear. When the highly controversial Nationstate Law was passed, it was the voice of the Druze that made even the far-right reconsider their stances. Israel's had the support of several Native American nations, with letters from their governments and even official visits. This is to say nothing of the closest kin of the Jews, the Samaritans. This is because, contrary to the belief of many, Jews are themselves an indigenous people who actually *reversed* colonization. While genocides, forced conversions, and an early settler-colonial system, made Syrians, Greeks, and Arabs the majority population of the Levant during the Middle Ages and the Baroque period, the Jewish mass returns, starting in the Middle Ages and increasing until the 20th century, restored a Jewish majority in many places during the 19th century. It's the equivalent of if the Oklahoma Cherokee bought new houses in North Carolina to reunite with their brethren. Before talk of \"land theft\" comes into play, as it often does, the Jewish migrations were by-and-large done legally with land purchased from both Arab landlords and the Ottoman government directly.\n\nNOW - on the domestic level, you're getting somewhere with this. Foreign policy is more \"contain Turkey and Iran, befriend Arabs\", which you should be able to understand well enough. Israel is led by a far-right leader at the moment, which is unfortunate, and most Jews are generally against many of his policies. The reason he's in power, though, is because many Israelis have lost hope. One of the biggest distinctions in Israeli politics is not LGBT rights, or religion this or that, but what the deal with Palestine is. The Left believes Palestine genuinely wants to make peace and is willing to make concessions for that, while the Right believes they aren't actually interested and seek to essentially pressure them into it. That's what the settlements are: a time-bomb, saying \"If you don't make peace, these areas will be too Jewish for you to take back\"\n", "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Judaism", "date_year_month": "2019-02", "created_utc_converted": "2019-02-17 08:07:15", "score_overall": 18, "words": "conspiracy jewish jew jew jewish jewish jewish conspiracy jewish jewish jewish jew jewish libel jewish jewish jewish jewish", "shared_words": "conspiracy jewish jew libel", "socre_distint": 4}

Rebecca Pierce\u2019s mother, Margalynne Armstrong, \u201cdecided to raise her [Rebecca] as an Episcopalian,\u201d according to a 2016 interview Armstrong did for the webzine, Journey with Jesus. Pierce\u2019s mother grew up going to Catholic Mass and \u201cthinking I was Catholic, but wasn\u2019t officially,\u201d due to not performing the required rituals (more irony). According to her mother, Pierce\u2019s father, an agnostic, grew up in Highland Park, Illinois, attended Hebrew school and had a confirmation, which means he grew up Reform, but he was never a bar mitzvah because, \u201chis rabbi found no scriptural support for the ceremony,\u201d which is a bizarre statement in a post-Holocaust Reform movement. However, for the sake of anyone arguing that her father is legitimately Jewish, Pierce was never raised as a Jew.  She apparently only decided to \u201cidentify as Jewish,\u201d as her mother puts it, when she went to college and joined Students for Justice in Palestine. So even if Pierce has patrilineal Jewish bona fides, why did she specifically decide to \u201cidentify as Jewish\u201d with the apparent purpose of demonizing the Jewish state and those Jews who support its existence?\n\n&gt;Pierce\u2019s anti-Semitism is so egregious, she\u2019s been highlighted by Canary Mission, which is the Jewish equivalent of Shaun King in his efforts to dox racists. But instead of publishing where racists work or live, like King does, Canary Mission simply posts links and images of anti-Semites\u2019 own statements. Canary Mission recently made international headlines for highlighting a doctor in Ohio, Lara Kollab, who had posted that she\u2019d \u201c\u2026purposely give all the yahood [Jews] the wrong meds\u201d on social media. As with Kollab, Pierce\u2019s own words are enough of an indictment. The Canary Mission profile provides evidence of Pierce promoting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, supporting the destruction of Israel via Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS), and equating Zionism with white supremacy. The pinnacle of Pierce\u2019s Jewhatred is her adulation of convicted terrorist, Rasmea Odeh, who confessed to being behind the bombing at a Jerusalem grocery store that killed two Jewish college students. Pierce tweeted, \u201cWe love you Rasmea!\u2019 \u2014 JVP membership to Rasmea Odeh #JVP2017\u201d with an image of Odeh on stage at the JVP Conference in March 2017.\n\n", "score": 4, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "politics", "date_year_month": "2019-02", "created_utc_converted": "2019-02-17 12:31:10", "score_overall": 11, "words": "jewish holocaust jewish jew jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish conspiracy jewish", "shared_words": "jewish holocaust jew conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "hahabones", "body": "&gt;cultural marxism\n\n&gt;&gt;In contemporary usage, the term **Cultural Marxism identifies an anti-semitic conspiracy theory that misrepresents the Frankfurt School intellectuals as part of continual academic and intellectual efforts to undermine and destroy Western culture**, then to be replaced with Marxist culture. In the late 1990s, Cultural Marxism claimed that the Frankfurt School were in a culture-war conspiracy against the Western world, to be realised by undermining traditionalist conservatism with the social liberalism of the Counterculture of the 1960s, such as the social equality of progressive politics, the racial equality of multiculturalism, and linguistic political correctness.\n\n&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School#Cultural_Marxism_conspiracy_theory\n\n\n&gt;&gt;Talking about the Frankfurt School is ideal for not naming the Jews as a group (which often leads to a panicky rejection, a stubborn refusal to listening anymore and even a \"shut up\") but naming the Jew by proper names. People will make their generalizations by themselves - in the privacy of their own minds. At least it worked like that with me. It was my lightbulb moment, when confusing pieces of an alarming puzzle suddenly grouped to a visible picture. Learn by heart the most important proper names of the Frankfurt Schoolers - they are (except for a handful of minor members and female \"groupies\") ALL Jews.

{"author": "RestrepoMU", "body": "I can see you've been commenting here a lot about this issue, and as a Labour supporting British Jew, I wanted to shed some light.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirstly let me say that I support Corbyn as the Labour leader, though not wholeheartedly personally, and I think he's done a passable job so far addressing the undeniable issue of anti-sematism in Labour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen people (or at least when I) harp on Labours issue with anti-sematism, there are a few specific reasons. Firstly, Im aware that the worst anti-semites are often right wingers. Radical right wing views and anti-sematism go hand in hand. But that doesn't mean Labour and the left don't also have a problem. When some on the left calls Labour out on it, it's because some expect vitriol and hatred from the far right, but don't expect it from their own party. While I don't exactly remain quiet when a Tory says something bad, it's a little more personal when a Labour member says it.\n\nSecondly, your twitter evidence. A 16% to 10% decrease is not nothing, but it's also not 0% (I hope you aren't satisfied with 10%, I know I'm not). I'd also note that the tories also had their own decrease in the same time. I'm also not sure how much I want to trust a poll to measure ant-jewish feelings. But the issue here is not that the \\*membership\\* is anti semetic, it's that the leadership or officials may have an issue. I expect a good 10-15% of the population to be anti-semetic (isn't that depressing), but I will not tolerate a single person in a position of political power.\n\nLastly, ant--sematism and Labour is a tiring subject. Corbyn repeatedly and regularly has been caught in compromising and concerning positions. Supporting persons who accuse Jews of drinking the blood of children, being in Facebook groups that deny the Holocaust, defended a man who thinks Jews did 9/11, and has apparently long been associated with a group that has denied the holocaust. There are more.\n\nNow, \\*\\*Disclaimer\\*\\*. I do firmly believe that Corbyn is often the victim of a media witch-hunt. I think some of those examples are harmless mistakes, or careless oversights, or unfortunate coincidences. I think it also often comes from Corbyn's admirable belief in standing up for his beliefs, even when it might not be 100% politically expedient. I'm sure there are or were good reasons to associate with some of the groups. Corbyn is a fierce supporter of those who have little or no voice, and of the underdogs of the world. It seems only natural that he may end up rubbing shoulders with some less than perfect characters. Maybe he could've exercised a little more caution, but maybe he couldn't have known.\n\nBut that doesnt change the fact that it gets harder and harder for people like me to defend Corbyn everytime something like that happens. Eventually, it gets harder and harder to give him the benefit of the doubt that his association with these characters is purely innocent. I still believe that Corybn is no more anti-semetic than the average person, but it's somewhat difficult to be comfortable in that position.\n\nIt's also undeniable that Labour candidates have repeatedly stated anti-semetic positions, and have sometimes not been punished for it. [In 1 10 month period, Labour received an average of 2 complaints a day](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47203397). Here are some of the Labour figures or candidates:\n\n[Alan Bull](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-43655793), [Lord Ahmed](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/muslim-peer-lord-ahmed-blames-jewish-conspiracy-for-jailing-him-nkcxnk892wj), [Andrew Slack](https://antisemitism.uk/labour-refuses-to-say-what-will-happen-to-councillor-who-posted-image-of-hook-nosed-bloodthirsty-jew/), [Anne Kennedy](https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahalothman/another-labour-councillor-has-been-suspended-over-alleged?utm_term=.leAlqKma3#.lp3Gr8Vlm), [Aysegul Gurbuz](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/aysegul-gurbuz-labour-councillor-suspended-after-praising-hitler-on-social-media-a6977611.html), [Beinazir Iasharie](http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/exclusive-labour-councillor-suspended-over-israel-isis-slur/), [Billy Wells](https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/labour-drop-council-candidate-who-posted-about-rich-families-of-the-zionist-lobby/), [Nasreen Kahn](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-42009240) to name a few, and some of them have been 'cleared'.  \n\n\nHere are over 50 other examples [https://twitter.com/GnasherJew/status/1048871683694764032](https://twitter.com/GnasherJew/status/1048871683694764032)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan you understand why it's difficult to give the party I support the full benefit of doubt, when this stuff happens over and over and over again, and when it doesn't seem to happen to other parties?  \n\n\nI commend you for your strong defense of Labour and Corbyn and again I acknowledge that this problem is often overblown by the media. bit it \\*is\\* a problem and it \\*does\\* exist. Just as Jews must be vocal in calling out racism within our own communities (especially when it comes to anti-palestinian vitriol), so must Labour supporters be completely intolerant of anti-sematism in Labour.   \n\n\nDo you understand why bluntly asking for evidence of anti-sematism when there are so many examples isnt helpful? When so so many British Jews can see a problem that it feels Labour sometimes doesn't want to acknowledge? Why 1 poll that shows 10% of labour members are still anti-semetic is still an issue? Trust me when I say that Labour can do better.   \n\n\nBecause of course:\n\n[British Jews overwhelmingly believe that Corbyn is Anti-semetic](https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/more-than-85-per-cent-of-british-jews-think-jeremy-corbyn-is-antisemitic-1.469654).  \n\n\n(Disclaimer, I left the UK a few years ago to live in the states for work.

You forced me to become a Maccabee by trying to force me to accept that as \"secular\" when it isn't.

Little more than 3 months ago, there was an incident where a group of white teenagers had a prom photo leaked where they were all waving at the cameras, and the media twisted and distorted it into a nazi salute. Jewish organizations, including a Holocaust remembrance organization called the Auschwitz Memorial Museum, joined on the bandwagon to paint these 17-year-olds and 18-year-olds as the second coming of Adolf Hitler. \n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/baraboo-high-school-nazi-salute-prom-photo-wisconsin-students/\n\nEven in the worst case where these kids were, I don't know, participating in some kind of immature white power celebration, it should be troubling that we live in a society where the elites and the institutions believe that innocent Americans ought to have their lives destroyed for something so harmless.

Borrowed from some of the more ludicrous claims at the McMartin Preschool trial and mixed with some rather nasty anti-LGBTQA content (tl;dr quite a number of these folks think in all seriousness that there is a Gay Illuminati that is a Satanic Cabal that has worked since the age of Sodom and Gomorrah to convert us all to the ways of Diabolism and Fabulosity...who were not only not targeted in the Holocaust but were its architects because Gays Do It For The Evulz...oh, and they grow their members by essentially raping kids in the name of Satan).\n\nSome of the weirder stuff about Hillary Clinton apparently being part of all this?

Pretty much right out of NAR \"spiritual warfare\" memes (which is why they never gave up \"Satanic Panic\") as written in the \"Left Behind\" novels.

I'm actually surprised the term \"Phinehas Priest\" hasn't escaped the lips of the occasional Qultist yet...\n\nObama giving secret messages backwards about praising Satan?

At least Obama is now in good company with Judas Priest!\n\nSo, what will they borrow next?  (My ten pence is on them bringing up the old canard that specific brands' logos and other innocuous symbols are in fact Satanic references, if they've not done so already.  I remember the same folks peddling the idea that Judas Priest was trying to get kids to sacrifice themselves to Satan were also claiming that Nike shoes were Satanic (due to being named for the Greek goddess of victory) and the peace symbol (due to a spurious claim that it was based on an upside down cross with broken arms--in fact, the symbol is derived from semaphore for \"total nuclear disarmament\" and its history is well documented) and the Proctor and Gamble \"old servicemark\" (under a completely fabricated claim--ultimately traced to an NAR-linked downline of Amway that heavily cross-recruited for both Amway and NAR churches--that supposedly the service mark was designed as a Satanic symbol representing Satan and thirteen fallen angels and that the board of directors for P&amp;G were an active Satanist cabal that resulted in a successful libel lawsuit by P&amp;G--even then, the servicemark (which P&amp;G had used for over 100 years) was so tainted that they eventually dropped it) and many, many other completely innocuous symbols were ALL Satanic and merely having them in your house would literally curse you for seven generations.)", "score": 8, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "TopMindsOfReddit", "date_year_month": "2019-02", "created_utc_converted": "2019-02-20 17:35:05", "score_overall": 4, "words": "illuminati holocaust conspiracy libel", "shared_words": "illuminati holocaust conspiracy libel", "socre_distint": 4}

Christianity is by far the major religion of the United States. A close estimate of the Christian faith in the US is around 75% when including various Christian denominations in the same count. In contrast Judaism is the religion of 2.1% of the population within the United States. According to the Pew Research Center there are around 5.3 million Jews living in the United States. Israel has just over 6.5 million Jews living there. World Jewry is estimated to be around 14.5 million total. When hearing these numbers the Black Hebrew Israelites should really be asking themselves if they fit the description of v.62. To an honest individual the answer is clear. If you add in the numbers of the African diaspora the numbers are staggering. The Caribbean has almost 40 million descendants of Africans living there. South America has over 388 million living there. North America has over 450 million. India alone has over 1 billion descendants of Africans living there. These are just the numbers within the African Diaspora. Africa itself is home to over 1 billion Africans. As you can see Africans are by no means \u201cfew in number\u201d. They are a people composed of multiple billions.\n\nCommonly the Black Hebrew Israelites will make the claim that their African brethren are not Hebrews, or descendants of Shem ben Noach. They will claim that Africans still living in Africa are actually sons of Noahs son Ham and that only those affected by the Transatlantic Slave Trade are true Shemites. They will often make the audacious claim that their African brethren (Hamites) sold them (Shemites) into slavery. This may seem unbelievable, but many of them actually believe just like this. If we were to look only at African Americans living in America at roughly 47 million, the population would still far outnumber world Jewry by almost 4 times as many, while Negroes in general would outnumber Jews 143:1 worldwide.\n\nOne must also note that Jews as a people are and have been the only people keeping the Torah. No other people have been worried about eating kosher. Where can you go in any other community and speak with someone who understands what must take place during the slaughter of an animal which makes it kosher and permissible for consumption. Every place where you find the Hebrew language, you will find the Jewish people. Every Torah Scroll in existence can only be attributed to the scribes of one nation, Israel.\n\nThese teachings which are so clearly false that have been taught and perpetrated by the so-called Black Hebrew Israelites are really no older than 50\u201360 years old. A man named Abba Bivens along with his seven misguided and equally imaginative companions named \u201cThe Seven\u201d began to propagate these fairy tales to a group of the most ignorant and impoverished African Americans that they could find to soak up their message of hate. The Jew, both Sephardic and especially Ashkenazi, became the all too familiar scapegoat of the Black Hebrew Israelite narrative. The accusation was that somehow in a time before mass communication, before the internet, before a modern postal service, before the advent of the telephone, or electricity in general; worldwide Jewry had somehow collaborated and stolen the \u201ctrue Israelite\u201d the \u201cAfrican American\u201d or \u201cNegroes\u201d real culture, language, and history. They made the sick claim that Jews were not only responsible, but funded the Transatlantic Slave Trade with the ultimate intention of stealing the West African\u2019s true identity as \u201cThe Black Hebrew Israelite\u201d. No matter how impossible or unbelievable this may seem there are huge numbers of good hearted African Americans falling into these lies. Another group has now been added to the list of hate groups which Jewish parents must teach their children to look out for. Numerous violent attacks carried out on visibly religious Jews (usually older and incapable of defense) have been happening over the past few years by members of this misguided and hate filled cult. It is my hope that by dispelling some of the myths that this hate group/cult teach, good hearted African Americans will find this information and apply some critical thinking to the claims of these hate groups and outright reject them as the lies they clearly are. I also hope this information I have detailed here is used to combat the lies that these people teach to an audience who usually has no clue how to answer back to such wild accusations.\n\nThis is to be the first of many articles which debunk their teachings of hate. I began with the curses of Deuteronomy 28 and 28:68 especially because every Black Hebrew Israelite I have ever spoken with, both in person or written communication, has fallen back on these curses as the reason and main proof text for getting involved in and believing in the teachings of this cult.\n\n ", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "u_DNACHMAN613", "date_year_month": "2019-02", "created_utc_converted": "2019-02-21 02:51:59", "score_overall": 6, "words": "kosher kosher jewish jew scapegoat jewish", "shared_words": "kosher jewish jew scapegoat", "socre_distint": 4}

But I think there is a continuum between cavorting and participating. And I definitely agree that some deniers hide behind 'questioning the numbers' or similar. But I think there's more going on here. There's a problematic use of the Holocaust as a justification for Israel's policies, including human rights violations:\n\n* Former Israeli PM Menachem Begin justified Israel's invasion of Lebanon as necessary for security reasons, and described Yasser Arafat as a 'second Hitler' (an accusation later echoed by a Czech PM during Israel's siege of Arafat's compound in Ramallah).\n* Israeli PM Netanyahu warned that a nuclear Iran would cause a second Holocaust.\n* Netanyahu once said that the Palestinian grand mufti of Jerusalem 'gave Hitler the idea for the Holocaust' - effectively blaming a Palestinian for the Holocaust (an outrageous lie).\n* The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism includes \"Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor\" (the State of Israel defines itself as an ethno-state, and was founded via the forcible removal of the Palestinians who were living there, and I don't believe ethno-states should exist). Another definition is \"Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation\" (this practically means that whenever anyone criticizes Israel, they need to similarly criticize another country elsewhere)\n* There was an occasion in 2010, where an honest-to-goodness actual Holocaust survivor compared the Israeli regime to the Nazis (something that the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance defines as antisemitic). Corbyn was at the event, and later apologized for being there because it was termed antisemitic. I don't think Israel should be compared to the Nazis (because they haven't committed genocide, it's ethnic cleansing, which is different - but also because).\n\nThere's a general attempt to stifle criticism of Israel as antisemitic. I receive ads daily on Twitter that conflates boycotting Israel for her treatment of Palestinians as antisemitic, with a smear campaign against the leaders of BDS (I don't support BDS, but I don't think it's antisemitic). They sometimes make comparisons between it and the German boycott of Jewish businesses (The two are worlds apart). BDS has been outlawed in some places as a result - despite being a non-violent protest movement.\n\nThere is a long list of crimes done by the State of Israel (thousands dead, separate roads, checkpoints, inability to travel internationally, seizing land). Unfortunately, sometimes those who criticize Israel do so out of a hatred of Jews, or in order to hide that hatred. There have been times, when I was dressed as an Orthodox Jew, and people would shout Palestine-related abuse at me (just because I was Jewish). Netanyahu plays into this conflation when he says that he speaks on behalf of all Jews. Both are reprehensible.\n\nMy feeling is that the Overton Window has to move towards being more critical to Israel. Israel could be treated similarly to apartheid South Africa (although there are differences, it is telling that many leaders of resistance to apartheid have drawn comparisons). I don't wish to bring in all the kooks, the holocaust deniers, conspiracy theories or antisemites into mainstream politics. But I wish that Israel could be criticized fairly, without special treatment, and that the same criticisms could be made of our association with Israel as, for example, our association with Saudi Arabia.\n\nThis is not a one-sided problem, with antisemites on one side, and persecuted Jews on the other. We need to fight antisemitism. But we also need to fight the use of the Holocaust to justify the crimes committed by Israel.\n\nCavorting with antisemites is wrong, she should be condemned for that. And antisemites sometimes hide behind criticism of Israel. But Israel also silences legitimate criticism by claiming it is antisemitic.", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "date_year_month": "2019-02", "created_utc_converted": "2019-02-21 14:56:59", "score_overall": 14, "words": "holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust jewish holocaust holocaust jewish jew jewish holocaust conspiracy holocaust", "shared_words": "holocaust jewish jew conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

Don't you understand that to include that assertion among his other extremely inflammatory and obviously inappropriate statements is odd? I don't know who this professor is, but they deserve firm disciplinary action for acting this way publicly because it's extremely unprofessional. \n\nBut that's beside the point. Do you think that this person making ridiculously inflammatory statements, even if they're sincere, is some sort of proof that there is a massive conspiracy against white people and that there is an impending threat of violence against white people due to it?

Many of these statements are circulated among both far-right and far-left as indictments against their ideological opposition as a whole. \n\nThis seems to be what you're implying when you zero in on this insane professor, that there is a concerted plot by liberals or leftists as a whole to kill white people.

Also notable is that in many cases, Muslims have become the target of violence.\n\nFor example last year three men from Illinois who were charged for planning to bomb a mosque. One of the men drafted a border wall plan for Trump.[6] I'll include this small excerpt from an article by USA Today, I implore everyone to read how far right terrorism is rapidly accelerating in America.

First he tweeted it[8] followed by him saying this as a statement during a speech later in the day.[9] Moreover, former Trump Campaign Chairman Cory Lewandowski went on national television and dehumanized a child with Down Syndrome who had been separated from their family.[10] President Trump has peddled anti-semetic conspiracies including the conspiracy that a prominent Jew is behind the migrant caravans[11] that he claims are \"invading\" the country.[12] And Fox News has repeated extremely dangerous xenophobic rhetoric that these migrants are bringing diseases with them, they're not.[13] Holocaust experts have compared the President's statements to Nazi propaganda.[14]\n\nThese xenophobic conspiracy theories are incredibly dangerous.

All the most worthless rascals, renouncing their national cults, started showering them with offerings and tribute. This is one cause of Jewish prosperity. Another is that they are obstinately loyal to each other and always ready to show compassion, whereas they feel nothing but hatred and enmity for the rest of mankind.\u00a0\n\nTacitus, *Annals*\n\n&gt;\u201c\\[\u2026\\]they only, of all people, hated to converse with any of another nation, and treated all of them as enemies.  \n\\[\u2026\\] Moses \u2026 built Jerusalem,established the nation, and made all their impious customs and\u00a0practices\u00a0legal: for these abound in hatred and enmity to all other men.  \n\\[...their\\] sacred books, whereby they were taught to hate all other nations\\[...\\]\n\nDiodorus Siculus, *Bibliotheca Historica*\n\nIndeed, that is the essence of their religion from the beginning:\n\n&gt;For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.\u201d \\[ISAIAH 60:12\\]  \nIf thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them? Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt; \\[\u2026\\] Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible. And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee. But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed. And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them. \\[Deuteronomy 7:17-18 &amp; 7:21-24\\]  \n\u201cAsk of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.

The non-Jew is consequently an animal in human form, and condemned to serve the Jew day and night. Midrasch Talpioth, p. 225-L\n\nThey harbor a special vendetta against whites because they associate Europeans with Rome who cast them down and because it is the nature of this parasite to hate in particular the host who gave it succor.\n\n&gt;The Sages said that the fortunes of Caesarea, which represents Rome, and Jerusalem are diametric opposites. If, therefore, someone says to you that both cities are destroyed, do not believe him. Similarly, if he says to you that they are both settled in tranquility, do not believe him. If, however, he says to you that Caesarea is destroyed and Jerusalem is settled, or that Jerusalem is destroyed and Caesarea is settled, believe him. As it is stated: \u201cBecause Tyre has said against Jerusalem: Aha, the gates of the people have been broken; she is turned to me; I shall be filled with her that is laid waste\u201d (Ezekiel 26:2), and Tyre, like Caesarea, represents Rome. Consequently, the verse indicates that if this city is filled, that one is laid waste, and if that city is filled, this one is laid waste. The two cities cannot coexist. *Megillah 6a*  \n\"The People of the Earth are idolaters, and it has been written about them: *Let them be wiped off the face of the earth. Destroy the memory of the Amalekites*. They are with us still in this Fourth Captivity, namely, the Princes \\[of Rome\\]\\* . . . who are really Amalakites.\" *Zohar (I,25a)*  \nIt is certain that our captivity will last until the princes of the Gentiles who worship idols are destroyed. *Zohar* *(I,219B)*  \nHappy will be the lost of Israel, whom the Holy One, blessed be He, has chosen from amongst the Goyim, of whom the Scriptures say: \"Their work is but vanity, it is an illusion at which we must laugh; they will all perish when God visits them in His wrath.\" At the moment when the Holy One, blessed be He, will exterminate all the Goyim of the world, Israel alone will subsist, even as it is written: \"The Lord alone will appear great on that day! . = Zohar, Sec. Vayschlah *Folio 177b\u00a0..*  \n\"Immediately after Rome is destroyed we shall be redeemed.\" Rabbi Abraham, *Tseror Hammor*, *Schoftim*,\n\n\\* In the tannaitic Haggadah of the first century Amalek stands for Rome (Bacher, \"Ag.

Let's see:\n\nEarl Raab, executive director emeritus of the Perlmutter Institute of Jewish Advocacy, an associate of the ADL (Anti- Defamation League of B\u2019nai B\u2019rith) and writer for the San Francisco Jewish Bulletin, wrote:\n\n&gt;It was only after World War II that immigration law was drastically changed to eliminate such discrimination. In one of the first pieces of evidence of its political coming-of-age, the Jewish community has a leadership role in effecting those changes.\n\nRaab goes on to celebrate the coming minority status of Whites in America. Once that has happened, he looks forward to \u201cconstitutional constraints\u201d (restriction of freedom of speech?):\n\n&gt;The Census Bureau has just reported that about half of the American population will soon be non-white or non-European. And they will all be American citizens. We have tipped beyond the point where a Nazi-Aryan party will be able to prevail in this country.  \nWe have been nourishing the American climate of opposition to ethnic bigotry for about half a century. That climate has not yet been perfected, but the heterogeneous nature of our population tends to make it irreversible and makes our constitutional constraints against bigotry more practical than ever.\n\nDavid Duke, *Jewish Supremacism*; Jewish Bulletin.

{"author": "hannahstohelit", "body": "Americans had already associated Nazis with anti-Semitism many years earlier. At the time of Hitler's ascent in 1933, news of Hitler's mistreatment of Jews was already hitting the American presses, and there were protests, a boycott movement, and petitions from all over the United States. But by the end of 1933, they were gone from the front page, to be buried in back sections of the paper. Why?\n\nAmericans by 1933 were focused more on domestic concerns, such as their recovery from the Depression FDR had just been elected, the country was in the depths of economic crisis, and the New Deal was being implemented. There was also a strong sense of isolationism, which could on the one hand manifest itself in relatively benign ways in the anti-war movement (I've been doing some primary source research on American religious Jewish students in the pre-war years, and they were EXTREMELY anti-war) but on the other hand could also manifest itself in anti-Semitism (Charles Lindbergh and Father Charles Coughlin were both very anti-Semitic isolationists who had the public attention at this time).\n\nAnti-Semitism was at this time very strong and powerful, with many believing in Jewish conspiracies controlling the United States.  So if people were protesting Hitler's anti-Semitism in 1933, just as many were lauding- or at least not disapproving of- it. Jack Morgan, the son of JP Morgan (also noted for his anti-Semitism), said that he disliked Hitler \"except for his attitude toward the Jews, which I consider wholesome.\" Social anti-Semitism among the upper and middle classes in the US was de rigueur, and one of the many reasons why so many Jews changed their names among reaching the United States (NOT at Ellis Island, but later). Many of Hitler's own ideas came from American sources: Madison Grant's *The Passing of the Great Race* and Henry Ford's *The International Jew*, among others. Christian writers, including in publications like the *Christian Century*, pointed to Hitler's persecution of the Jews as a punishment for them and, while often decrying anti-Semitism as such, clearly advocated for the conversion of Jews to Christianity. There were many groups which were outright Nazi sympathizers, printing and distributing Nazi propaganda, key among it anti-Semitic ideology. People who disliked FDR and the New Deal used fears of Jewish conspiracy as part of their arguments, calling it the \"Jew Deal\" and claiming that Roosevelt was actually a \"Rosenfelt\"- Jewish himself.\n\nThe fact that the Jewish angle of the Nazi persecution was neglected by the media in these years is therefore not a huge surprise. After Kristallnacht, in November 1938, nationwide opinion was by far against Hitler and the Nazi government's anti-Semitic actions, but for the most part there wasn't a lot of commentary on these aspects. And there were many who decried the anti-Semitism, particularly those who called out Father Coughlin for his anti-Semitic distortions of fact. But even those who acknowledged anti-Semitism were against the actions that the US could do about it- in a Fortune Magazine poll, 67% of Americans wanted to discourage German and Austrian refugee immigration, and 81% wanted to block increased immigration. After the Nye Commission decided that false propaganda was one of the main ways that the US had been duped into joining WWI, when real reports came of WWII, people often wouldn't believe it! When the Wagner-Rogers Bill was proposed in 1939 to bring 20,000 children under age 14 to the US, 61% of Americans disapproved of it, and it was blocked by anti-Semitic senator Robert Rice Reynolds. (Compare this to the Kindertransport, in which England famously took in 10,000 children, saving their lives- the US could have done twice this.) People knew very little about what was going on in Europe, and those who knew often buried that information deep in the back pages of the papers- 1147 stories about what later became known as the Holocaust were featured in the New York Times, but they were so small and buried so far back in the paper that people rarely read them and understood fully from then what was going on. American Jews knew slightly more, but not much more- and their protests accomplished little. Anti-Semitism was a powerful force in the US during WWII- as late as June 1945, polls found that 58% of Americans felt that Jews held too much power in the US. (Anti-Semitism began to ebb in the years immediately following the war, due to a decrease in social acceptability.)\n\nTo put it all down to anti-Semitism is certainly not my point here- another reason why Jews were not emphasized was that until 1943, they were generally seen as only one of many populations being persecuted by the Nazis. By the time the war began and Jews began to be murdered en masse, the front pages focused on the war itself, not on the Jews. It was mostly after the concentration camps were liberated in 1945 by American troops that the fact of the Jewish nature of the suffering became a focus, which is almost certainly one of the reasons that levels of anti-Semitism began to recede at that time. But the anti-Semitism in the US at the time certainly created the environment in which the Jewish suffering was underexposed and, subsequently, in which Casablanca was made.\n\nTo go back to the movie (one of my favorites)- it didn't mention Jews once, but that makes sense given how Hollywood was at the time. The leadership of the studios was, of course, filled with Jews, and these Jews did often support Jewish causes, but in many senses the studio leadership tried to de-emphasize their Jewishness. Jewish actors and directors would often change their names. Filmmakers and producers did not use the medium to promote Judaism or Jewish ideas in the least- and in fact, often did quite the opposite. They were not religious in the least, and did not believe their Judaism to be important parts of their lives. They were certainly not a monolith- but many of the same anti-Semites mentioned above didn't agree. In particular, the Production Code amplified Christian values, and was run by an anti-Semite, Joseph Breen. People emphasized the difference of these Jewish studio people, which aroused suspicion of them. The social anti-Semitism mentioned above was just as strong in Hollywood as it was anywhere else, and Jewish film people had their own social clubs as they were barred from so many others. Anti-Semitic feelings only grew when Hollywood began to attract a lot of refugee talent- Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger, Hedy Lamarr, Bertholt Brecht, and Billy Wilder, to name only a few.\n\nCasablanca probably benefited the most from this explosion of refugee talent. The director, Michael Curtiz, was a Jewish refugee. The soundtrack composers, Max Steiner and Erich Wolfgang Korngold, were Jewish refugees. Peter Lorre, Paul Henreid, S Z Sakall, Madeleine LeBeau, Marcel Dalio, Curt Bois, and Leonid Kinskey- who all had speaking roles as refugees- were all refugees themselves, some of them Jewish. (Peter Lorre, S Z Sakall, Curt Bois, Marcel Dalio and Leonid Kinskey were all Jewish;  Madeleine LeBeau was married to Marcel Dalio.) Not only that, but the actor playing Major Strasser, Conrad Veidt, was a refugee as well- he was married to a Jewish woman. He was just one of a large number of European refugees, including many Jewish refugees, who played Nazis in the media for tens of years after the war, starting with Confessions of a Nazi Spy in 1939. (Famously, every single Nazi in the 60s TV show Hogan's Heroes was played by a Jew, and all but one by a refugee from the Nazis- the actor playing one of the lead Nazis only took the role on the condition that the Nazis would never win and would always look silly. One of the prisoners on the show was played by a Jewish Holocaust survivor.) Casablanca's screenwriters Julius and Philip Epstein and Howard Koch were also Jewish, but not refugees; in addition, Joy Page, who played the refugee Annina, was Jewish but not a refugee. \n\nWhile Casablanca wouldn't portray Jews specifically, as they were not part of the major narrative of the war and fight against Nazis (they were seen as only some of those on the Nazis' list of enemies of the state) and because the executives, though in their own time often specifically advocating for the fate of the Jews (specifically Warner Brothers, who made Casablanca), focused more on the general themes of anti-fascism in their films, they did very much not only portray the Jewish refugee experience (especially as so many refugees in real-life Casablanca really were Jewish), they used Jewish refugees in order to do so. It's oddly probably one of the most markedly Jewish movies of the era, despite containing no named Jewish characters at all. It is of course very easy to read the many refugee characters as Jewish, even if they're not stated to be such- even if emphasizing their Judaism wouldn't be in sync with the predominant American conception of the war on Hitler, it certainly would be in the minds of those creating the movie.\n\nSources:\n\nBernardi, Pomerance, and Tirosh-Samuelson, *Hollywood's Chosen People: The Jewish Experience in American Cinema*\n\nDinnerstein, *Antisemitism in America*\n\nNovick, *The Holocaust in American Life*\n\nFermaglich, *A Rosenberg by Any Other Name*\n\n[*https://www.ushmm.org/information/about-the-museum/museum-publications/memory-and-action/1933-how-did-americans-react*](https://www.ushmm.org/information/about-the-museum/museum-publications/memory-and-action/1933-how-did-americans-react)", "score": 29, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "date_year_month": "2019-02", "created_utc_converted": "2019-02-24 21:37:05", "score_overall": 35, "words": "jewish jewish jew jewish conspiracy jew jewish jewish holocaust jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jew jewish holocaust jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish holocaust", "shared_words": "jewish jew conspiracy holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}

Jeremy Corbyn, who didn\u2019t notice the antisemitism in one of his supporters accusing a Jewish Labour MP of conspiring with the media, at an event to launch a report on antisemitism.  \nI understand why this is said to be anti-semitic but I think it is important to be careful here. A Jewish MP could well conspire with some media organizations. To uncover that is not anti-semitic. However this does get quite close to anti-semitic tropes so care should be taken.\n\n7. Jeremy Corbyn, who didn\u2019t notice the antisemitism in his ally Pete Willsman\u2019s complaint that allegations of Labour antisemitism were fabricated by Jews.  \nI assume this is referring to the 50 second video which starts from a really awkward moment. It starts with \"they\" and goes on to accuse this \"they\" of fabricating evidence of social media, which if \"they\" really does mean Jewish people in general as has often been interpreted is indeed anti-semitic. It is quite possible however that \"they\" was referring to some other group in which case the comment while a bit dodgy isn't quite anti-semitic.\n\n8.

I\u2019m less concerned about matzah balls and gefilte fish than I am with the tradition from my ancestors and their testimony of Sinai. \n\nI find it interesting that you think Jewish thinking has been influenced and integrated Greek philosophy. Greek ideals are the very antithesis of Judaism. They believed in the glorification of the human body, indulgence of physical pleasures and epicurean Philosophy teaches that God, if He even exists, does not have any influence on the happenings of the world which is obviously not in conjunction with basic tenets of Judaism. \n\nTo take it a step further, Greek philosophy and Greek music are the very thing that the Talmud blames as the reason that Elisha Ben Abuya strayed from the path of Judaism and became a heretic. \n\n\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8 \u05de\u05d0\u05d9 \u05d6\u05de\u05e8 \u05d9\u05d5\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e4\u05e1\u05e7 \u05de\u05e4\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8 \u05d1\u05e9\u05e2\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05e2\u05d5\u05de\u05d3 \u05de\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9 \u05d4\u05e8\u05d1\u05d4 \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05df \u05e0\u05d5\u05e9\u05e8\u05d9\u05df \u05de\u05d7\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\n\nThe Gemara explains: A\u1e25er, what was his failing? Greek tunes never ceased from his mouth. He would constantly hum Greek songs, even when he was among the Sages. This shows that from the outset he was drawn to gentile culture and beliefs. Similarly, they said about A\u1e25er: When he would stand after learning in the study hall, many heretical books, which he had been reading, would fall from his lap. Therefore, he was somewhat unsound even when among the Sages. \n\nhttps://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah_15b.14\nSee the entire passage before and after this quote to read his entire story. \n\nAlso, surely we can\u2019t neglect to mention Hellenistic Jews. Many of them had procedures to \u201cundo the bris milah\u201d to make it appear that they were uncut so they wouldn\u2019t feel so out of place during the naked olympics or in the bathhouses. Talk about fitting in with the goyim. \n\nIt\u2019s safe to safe that Greek ideology and Judaism don\u2019t mix. There\u2019s even less to say about Roman, Babylonian, Persian and especially western philosophy. \n\nIf we\u2019ve already mentioned music, I will admit that Nicki Minaj was a lowbrow example to make a statement, but the point still stands. The vast majority of secular music is not exactly singing about things that Judaism values. Mozart and Chopin are one thing, but much of modern music is very clearly not in line with Jewish values. \n\nThat being said, you might actually be surprised to learn that secular music, barring any obscene or heretical content, is actually technically halachically permitted to listen to.  Listen to this clip where he discusses the different opinions about this \n\nhttps://youtu.be/3HyhrzpY09I\n\nThe sages enacted safeguards to make sure none of this happened. Drinking gentile wine is a great example. Dining with goyim, even if you\u2019re eating kosher food, is another similar example that goes hand in hand with the wine. It\u2019s not that their wine is unkosher by any means- after all, we drink gentile beer that doesn\u2019t need to be kosher certified. It\u2019s just water and hops. But the sages did not want us to dine with them because then we get comfortable with them and before you know it you\u2019ve got gentile grandchildren. If you think I\u2019m being extreme, ask anyone who lived during the 50s/60s when their friends who had dinner with non Jewish business colleagues ended up marrying their sons and daughters to their newfound friends. Assimilation is a fact, like you mentioned. Mixing with the gentiles or adopting their lifestyles which will inevitably lead to mixing with them and marrying them will just continue to cause more assimilation. That\u2019s literally what the word means. \n\nAll in all, yes, there is what to gain from the secular world. There is lots of wisdom and stuff that can be gleaned from them, but we need to be cautious and make sure we\u2019re not getting too comfortable in this exile, especially in America. I\u2019d much rather trust the sages than myself. Sure, listening to James Taylor might not be the worst thing in the world, but he sure isn\u2019t helping me become a better Jew. \n\nI\u2019d be very confident to say that my philosophy is not novel or immature as you\u2019d like to suggest. Why don\u2019t you ask 10 orthodox Jews if this is something that, either, makes sense to them, or is something they currently practice. The answers might surprise you more in favor of The Rambam and Avraham Fried and much less in favor of Star Wars, The Beatles and Rembrandt.

{"author": "kusuriurikun", "body": "Depends on what segment of the right we're talking about:\n\na) The racist-right pretty much outright considers Jewish people to be Teh Evulz j00ish Illuminati (if not outright Lizard People or the Spawn of Satan Himself) doing things for teh evulz.  Therefore Israel is considered Teh Evulz in these groups as it's seen as kind of the mothership of Teh Evulz J00ish Illuminati. \n\nb) The dominionist right, especially the New Apostolic Reformation (which is a sizable proportion of the QAnon believers in particular)...well...there is a very, very weird fetishization of Jewish cultural trappings (usually in the context of what amounts to cultural appropriation in the name of \"Messianic Judaism\", which is really a form of neopentecostalism (typically NAR-linked neopentecostalism) which holds \"Seders\" and has \"Shabbos\" on Saturday instead of Sunday worship and does readings and services in modern Hebrew) and some similarly bizarre idolization of literally everything relating to right-wing Israel and Israeli politics.  This is related to their end-time theology, and specifically a rather bizarre Xanatos Gambit which essentially considers the re-establishment of Israel--and ultimately the destruction of the Dome on the Rock and re-establshment of the Third Temple and re-establishment of a formal priestly caste in Judaism as well as all of the world's Jewish people, both religiously observant and culturally Jewish, being forced one way or another to go to Israel--to be an essential point for Jesus to come back, rapture the NAR promoters for seven years, have two (post-Jewish) convertees to \"Messianic Judaism\" get martyred by the Antichrist which sparks the Mother Of All Tent Revivals where all of modern Judaism suddenly converts to NAR-neopentecostalism-what-keeps-kosher-and-observes-the-High-Holidays \"Messianic Judaism\" over the next three years, and then Jesus and the NAR come back to kill off literally everyone else on the planet and fuck off to a new heaven and earth.  ([The SHORT version of this actually has been fictionalized in the \"Left Behind\" series](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2008/5/21/519046/--Joel-s-Army-and-omnicide-in-the-name-of-God).)  \n\nOf note, the \"we fetishize the hell out of Israel although we really wish the Jewish people wouldn't be, you know, so damn *Jewish*\" stuff is pretty anti-Semitic as well, and not just because of the obvious \"culturally appropriate Judaism to convert people to New Apostolic Reformation neopentecostal belief\".  Quite a few NAR promoters have literally claimed that anti-Semitic violence (from programs to the Holocaust itself) were literally \"God's work\" to herd people to Israel and force its formation as a state, and that the reason anti-Semitic violence continues is because apparently God is still trying to herd people to Israel.  (Sometimes this goes REALLY horrible, like [NAR promoter John Hagee literally claiming Adolf Hitler was fufilling God's will in this regard](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/05/21/mccain-backer-hagee-said_n_102892.html).)\n\nAnd this gets additionally complicated because at least one of the groups in category a) (Christian Identity) is literally a sister movement to the movement in category b) (Christian Identity and the New Apostolic Reformation are both descendants of the Latter Rain/Manifest Sons of God movement, and the main difference between the NAR and Christian Identity with certain parts of the theology unique to Latter Rain/MSoG descended groups is that there's been both an attempt to expurgate the more blatantly racist/anti-Semitic aspects on one end (whereas Christian Identity explicitly embraced them) but at the same time changed to literally cast as demonic anyone opposed to the goals of the NAR).  There is still some non-negligible hybridization and transfer of materials between both groups, particularly in regards to the general concept of \"Serpent Seed\" theology (the idea that a portion of humanity is literally descended from the Devil via Cain, who...is supposed to be a product of an interspecies and possibly interplanar sexual tryst between Eve and the Devil in the form of the Serpent) and particularly in the concept of \"Phinehas Priesthoods\" as used by the NAR and by terrorist groups both in the NAR and Christian Identity.  \n\n(The original term--referring to an Israeli priest best known for assassinating an Israeli man and his Midianite bride in the Temple at Jerusalem whilst the married couple were consummating their marriage in a pre-Abrahamic fertility rite--was used in Christian Identity writer Richard Kelley Hoskin's *Vigilantes of Christendom* (which was Yet Another Fictionalisation of a Racial Holy War a la the *Turner Diaries*), and the concept was RAPIDLY adopted by both the Christian Identity terrorist group \"The Order\" and by the Army of God domestic terrorist network (which is largely NAR but has had the occasional Christian Identarian) and later on by NAR promoter Rick Joyner (as noted in the link above) in a general call for the NAR to destroy democratic society and establish a Republic of Gilead-esque theocratic dictatorship.)", "score": 5, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "TopMindsOfReddit", "date_year_month": "2019-02", "created_utc_converted": "2019-02-26 20:41:52", "score_overall": 11, "words": "jewish illuminati illuminati jewish jewish jewish jewish kosher jewish jewish holocaust", "shared_words": "jewish illuminati kosher holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}

Those Turks did not become the Ottomans which enslaved, raped, massacred, and terrorized Europeans for a long time right? Those Turks don't still occupy a land that from a nativist perspective, which I do not necessarily agree with, does not belong to them right? The Jews did not bring the Christian cult with them to Rome, which did not result in the destruction of the indigenous Indo-European cultures in Europe right? This is certainly not why paganism needs to be reconstructed and so many ancient wonders, statues, libraries, and mysteries have been lost right? You know you can actually look up at photographic evidence of Jews ritually sacrificing Christian children for a very long time right? They call this blood libel and claim it's a bias, even though, if you like I can post pictures and evidence of this. The Jews did not form the bulk of the Bolshevik leadership, which did not commit atrocities against white Christians in Russia and Holodomor. Jews were not part of the ANC and the Communist movement in South Africa which was and still is anti-white?

For Sartre, the anti-Semite has escaped the insecurity of good faith, the impossibility of sincerity. He has abandoned reason and embraced passion. Sartre comments that, \"It is not unusual for people to elect to live a life of passion rather than of reason. But ordinarily they love the objects of passion: women, glory, power, money. Since the anti-Semite has chosen hate, we are forced to conclude that it is the state of passion that he loves.\"[1] He chooses to reason from passion, to reason falsely \"because of the longing for impenetrability. The rational man groans as he gropes for the truth; he knows that reasoning is no more than tentative, that other considerations may intervene to cast doubt on it.\" Anti-Semites are attracted by \"the durability of a stone.\" What frightens them is the uncertainty of truth.[1] \"The anti-Semite has chosen hate because hate is a faith.\" He has escaped responsibility and doubt. He can blame anything on the Jew; he does not need to engage reason, for he has his faith.\n\nThe anti-Semite is a prime example of a person who has entered into bad faith to avoid responsibility. He attempts to relinquish his responsibility to anti-Semitism and a community of anti-Semites. He \"fears every kind of solitariness\u2026 however small his stature, he takes every precaution to make it smaller, lest he stand out from the herd and find himself face to face with himself. He has made himself an anti-Semite because that is something one cannot be alone.\" (p.22.) Anti-Semitism is a way of feeling good, proud even, rather than guilty at the abandonment of responsibility and the flight before the impossibility of true sincerity. The anti-Semite abandons himself to the crowd and his bad faith, he \"flees responsibility as he flees his own consciousness, and choosing for his personality the permanence of the rock, he chooses for his morality the scale of petrified values.\"(p.27.) [1] He pulls down shutters, blinds, mirrors and mirages over his consciousness to keep himself in his bad faith away from his responsibilities and his liberty. The anti-Semite is afraid \"of himself, of his own consciousness, of his own liberty, of his instincts, of his responsibilities, of solitariness, of change, of society, and the world \u2013 of everything except the Jews.\" He is \"a coward who does not want to admit his cowardice to himself.\" (p.53.)[1] The anti-Semite wallows in the depths of an extreme bad faith. \"Anti-Semitism, in short, is fear of the human condition. The anti-Semite is a man who wishes to be pitiless stone, a furious torrent, a devastating thunderbolt \u2013 anything except a man.\" (p. 54.)[1] This is his bad faith.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Semite_and_Jew#Jewishness_and_antisemitism\n\n\nbut seriously, goyboy, link me the hitler eliminating financial capital thing and where you got it from. i'd love to hear it. as for your RACE iq video, heres my favorite :\n\nEpic JEW CLAPBACKS AGAINST SEEDY VOICED GOYIM\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbgcnrOiFKA\n\njee boy, I sure am glad the jews lost in ww2, so I can watch this jew get paid millions unloading all over a hapless little goy.

Peterson's convinced himself to believe many of his lies. \n\n \\&gt;\"The Gulag Archipelago\" \n\nHe got \"selected\" to write the forward - which tellingly replaced the previous forward by Edward Ericson of the Hoover Institution, the right wing, big business think tank - because publishers recognized that kids who love Peterson, and who don't read, and who won't ever even complete \"The Gulag Archipelago\", were buying the book up in droves after hearing it mentioned in Peterson's lectures. Solzhenitsyn himself has been the posterboy for conservative intellectuals since the 1970s . An apartheid loving, uber Christian (or Russian Orthodox), who fawns over Franco and other fascists, gets them excited. (Not that Solzhenitsyn's pseudo-anthropological look at totalitarianism is wrong, but that's not why people like Peterson love him. He's loved because he distracts from the need to apply this rigor everywhere.)\n\nMeanwhile, here are actual historians on Peterson's favorite bash-a-~~Jew~~\\-commie author:\n\n\"Historian [Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohanan_Petrovsky-Shtern)  of Northwestern University published a refutation of Solzhenitsyn's  claims and has accused him of anti-Semitism.  \\[...\\] Solzhenitsyn falsely  claims Jews were overrepresented in the early [Bolshevik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevik)   leadership and the security apparatus, without citing his sources.  \\[...\\] Historian Richard Pipes has accused Solzhenitsyn's nationalism of  preventing him from being fully impartial, and that Solzhenitsyn uses  outdated  and inadequate sources. Pipes asserts that Solzhenitsyn failed  to  consider the \"poisonous atmosphere in which Jews lived for  generations  in the Russian empire (an atmosphere originating in Russian  Orthodox and  nationalist circles)\". \n\n\\[...\\] Solzhenitsyn was accused by the [Northwestern University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University) historian [Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohanan_Petrovsky-Shtern)   of using unreliable and manipulated figures, while ignoring evidence   unfavorable to his own point of view and, in particular, ignoring   numerous publications of reputable authors in Jewish history. Petrovsky  says that Solzhenitsyn claims that Jews promoted alcoholism  among the  peasantry, flooded the retail trade with contraband, and  \"strangled\"  the Russian merchant class in Moscow. He says that according to  Solzhenitsyn, Jews are non-producing people (\"\u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\")  and refuse to engage in factory labor. They are averse to agriculture  and unwilling to till the land either in Russia, in Argentina, or in  Palestine, and the author blames the Jews' own behavior for pogroms. He  says that Solzhenitsyn also claims that Jews used [Kabbalah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah)  to tempt Russians into heresy, seduced Russians with rationalism and  fashion, provoked sectarianism and weakened the financial system,  committed murders on the orders of [qahal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qahal)  authorities, and exerted undue influence on the prerevolutionary  government. Petrovsky summarizes his critique by stating that \"*200 Years Together* is destined to take a place of honor in the canon of russophone antisemitica.\"  \n\n\\[...\\] A critical analysis was published by historian [Semyon Reznik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semyon_Reznik).   According to Reznik Solzhenitsyn condones repressive measures  against Jews, and justifies them as intended for protection of the  rights of Russians  as the [titular nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titular_nation)   that supposedly \"greatly suffered from Jewish exploitation, alcohol   mongering, usury and corruption of the traditional way of life\".\n\n\\[...\\] Historian and demographer Sergey Maksudov referred to Solzhenitsyn's work as  \"a piece of pseudoscientific essayism\", which promulgates numerous   antisemitic stereotypes of Jews as professional parasites, infiltrators   into the Russian culture, and portrays repressive policies toward Jews   as being \"in Jews' own interests\". Maksudov also claims that   Solzhenitsyn was insensitive toward Jewish sufferings during [pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom) in general, and the [Kishinev pogrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kishinev_pogrom) in particular, and also accuses Solzhenitsyn of denying many well documented atrocities.\n\n\\[...\\] [John Klier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Klier), a historian at [University College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London),  writes that in his account of the pogroms of the early 20th  century,  Solzhenitsyn is far more concerned with exonerating the good  name of  the Russian people than he is with the suffering of the Jews,  and he  accepts the tsarist government's canards blaming the pogroms on   provocations by the Jews themselves. \\[...\\] A detailed analysis of *THYT* and an overview of critical opinion thereon was published by the [University of Waterloo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Waterloo)   professor Zinaida Gimpelevich. According to Gimpelevich, the critical   opinion worldwide overwhelmingly tilts against Solzhenitsyn.\n\n\\[...\\] [Grigory Baklanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Baklanov), a Russian novelist, in his critical study described *Two Hundred Years*  as \"worthless as historical scholarship\". Baklanov, himself a [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II)   veteran, focuses on Solzhenitsyn's insistence on Jews' supposed  wartime  cowardice and unwillingness to face the enemy, which he says is   contradicted both by the statistics of Jewish frontline casualties and   by the high number of Jews decorated for bravery in battle. \n\n\\[...\\] Literary historian [Leonid Katsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leonid_Katsis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1)   accuses Solzhenitsyn of numerous manipulated and selective quotations   in the first volume of the book, detrimental to its trustworthiness.  Cultural historian and comparatist Elisa Kriza discusses THYT in an   article about anti-Semitism in Solzhenitsyn's works and explains how   Solzhenitsyn's accusations towards Jewish people as a group and his   treatment of Russian Jews as \"foreign\", despite being in Russia for two   hundred years, are evidence of anti-Semitic rhetoric in the book.\n\n\\[...\\] Historians Leybelman, Levinskaya, and Abramov claim that  Solzhenitsyn uncritically used writings of antisemitic pseudo-historian [Andrey Dikiy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Dikiy) for his inflated statistical data of Jewish participation in the early Soviet government and its security apparatus.\n\n[Mark Deutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Deutch),  in a two-part review titled \"A Shameless Classic\" (\"\u0411\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0442\u044b\u0436\u0438\u0439  \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043a\"),lists numerous drawbacks, stemming, in his opinion, from  biased  exposition, ignoring well-known sources, self-contradictions,  and  factual errors.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "score": 9, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "enoughpetersonspam", "date_year_month": "2019-02", "created_utc_converted": "2019-02-28 18:10:21", "score_overall": 9, "words": "jew jewish merchant jewish jewish cowardice jewish jewish jewish", "shared_words": "jew jewish merchant cowardice", "socre_distint": 4}
