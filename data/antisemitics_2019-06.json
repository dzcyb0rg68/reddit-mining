There are people who have an academic, non-antisemitic interest in a correct understanding of history, who believe in a totally rational manner that events did not occur as is popularly believed.

The first Jews in the levant. The spread of Jews to Europe. Sephardi vs Ashkenazi. But also highlight Ethiopian Jews. There are a number of Jewish communities in Asia and theyre not simply the product of missionary work. Theres not one type of Jew. There are white, black, brown, asian etc. there is a pretty old Jewish community in India, in China, and was a sizeable one in Penang Malaysia, despite Mahathir...but he\u2019s another story...\n\n2) Should provide some coverage of antisemitism. The Spanish Inquisition is partly responsible for our having Sephardim in many locations around the world. Many other expulsions. Pogroms are why many Ashkenazim migrated from Europe.\n\nI worry that many Asians have never heard of the Holocaust. Many of them really believe the Jews are just a super successful minority that faces little actual oppression. Thus some are fascinated and want to learn our \u201cways\u201d to success or even buy lucky Jew figurines. The protocols of the elders of zion have been republished in many countries in the region. Despite the absence of Jews, there is a dangerous philosemitism based on these ideas in many parts, and a conspiracy theory laden antisemitism at its worst in many parts. All this exists despite the fact that there are \u201cno Jews\u201d...which isn\u2019t a fact! So I think it is really important to cover antisemitism and the Holocaust even though it isn\u2019t our \u201cculture\u201d.

I was talking about these groups like the BDS movement who single out one country and ignore the rest mainly because it is an easy scapegoat and it is easy to spread libel against it. Take Roger Waters for example. One of the biggest supporters of the BDS movement threatened Radiohead for months to cancel their concert in Israel but a week after Radiohead's performance, he had no problem performing in Russia. In my opinion the biggest human rights violator in the world right not. \n\n &gt;I am a non-zionist Jew\n\nIf you are talking about the actual Meaning of the term Zionist and not on the interpatation so many people have on that word than on a personal note it makes me really sad that there are Jews who are Anti-Zionist. Zionism is the belief for Jewish self-interpretation. It is the belief that Jews after thousands of years of persecution deserve a place they can be free of persecution and live there life without the threat of imminent doom. The Zionist movement and the state of Israel saved the lives of millions of Jews. The millions of Holocaust Survivors who had no place to go after 1945 and the almost one million Mizrahi Jews who were kicked out of Arab and Muslim lands and also and no place to go. My own parents had to flee Ukraine because it was not safe for them there anymore. That is why Hearing a Jew saying Israel should have never existed breaks my heart. \n\n&gt; disgusted by how the proto-fascist Israeli regime tries to use our religion as a rallying cry to excuse their inhuman behavior.\n\nLike I said. I am very much against the current Israeli regime but lets not involved religion into it. This is probably the biggest myth regarding the Israeli Palestinian conflict. That it is about religion it is not. It is about land. Pure and simple. Religion elements will be thrown into the conflict but at its basis, it was always about one thing. Tow groups fighting for the same land.\n\n&gt; The truth is that the proto-fascists who lead the Knesset have no incentive to create peace\n\nThe current one definitely. But I am 100% sure that the Palestinians are not interested in peace either.   \n\n&gt; They win election after election based on the fact that all the Arabs want to destroy the country and Palestinians want to overrun them\n\nWell, this is going to be tough to hear but that is true. The Palestinians are being led by two groups. Hamas who will Never, Ever, Ever give up their plans to annihilate Israel and the PA who has rejected countless of peace deals by Israel when it actually had a reasonable coalition. The things you are saying about the Israeli leadership can easily be applied to the Palestinian leadership. The biggest difference is that the Israeli leadership can be change in an election but elections are prohibited in Gaza and in the West Bank.\n\n&gt; Israel has not genuinely tried to create peace with their Arab neighbors since Rabin was assassinated by his own countrymen for being too nice to the big bad Arabs\n\n100% not true and that is the most infuriation thing you wrote. the 2000 camp David accords which were rejected by the Palestinians, Israeli disengagement from Gaza which resulted in Hamas taking over Gaza and over 15000 rockets being launched at Israeli cities, the 2008 Realignment plan which again was rejected by the Palestinians.\n\n&gt; I know my response goes far beyond the scope of your question, but once I realized you didn't even know about the quasi-apartheid policies of the Israeli government, I wanted to expand a little bit.\n\nI think this is the right time to tell you I have a degree in political science and I did my final paper on the first intifada. Again please don't patronize me by saying you know more about the conflict than I do.\n\nNow has for the article. I think the fact that your source is Al-Jazeera might give you a clue that what you are reading may not be \"objective\" or \"true\"\n\nRight to acquire, lease land\nThe first line here is that Arabs Cant buy or lease land from the JNF. They couldn't in the past when Israel was founded but the can since the 1960s. There are also tones of Arabs actually working for the JNF. some of them even do it as part of their Sherut Leumi. I do believe there is discrimination against Arabs when it comes to leasing and purchasing land from the state. Meaning it will probably take them more time to do so than Jews but there is no law which prohibits the leasing of land against Arabs.\n\nRight to residency\nThe Issue of residency in Jerusalem results in the fact that the Palestinians living there do not want to have Israeli citizenship. It is their own choice and as such they have issues regarding residence in those areas. it is sorted of like the issues with the dreamers in the US who will have problems returning to the US if they leave. \n\nRight to family life\nOK, so this one is kinda stupid. a Jewish person who was married to a Palestinian person living in the West Bank cannot reunite either. It is not a law against Arabs.\n\nRight to commemorate Nakba\nTo Israelis, the Nakba is not the tragedy of the Palestinian people being expelled to their homes but the failure of the Arabs to either kill or expel the Jews living in Israel. When the Arabs decided to attack Israel on the day of its foundation there were only two ways the war could have ended, The expulsion of the Jews or the expoltion of the Arabs. Obviously not all of the hundreds of thousands of Arabs who chose not to fight remained in Israel and became Israeli citizens. By acknowledging the Nakba you are asking Jews to mourn the fact that they were not annihilated. BTW Arabs can commemorate the Nakba as much as they want. They just can't do it with state money. \n\nNow, I think that there are laws that differentiate Arabs and Jews living in Israel. Arabs, for example, don't have to spend 3 years serving in the Army. they can start their higher education straight after Highschool. Also they have less chance of doing in colege that in the Army. Speaking of higher education several universities in Israel have Affirmative action Laws which require a certain percentage of students to be Arabs.", "score": 0, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "radiohead", "date_year_month": "2019-06", "created_utc_converted": "2019-06-05 16:51:52", "score_overall": 7, "words": "scapegoat libel jew jewish holocaust jew jewish", "shared_words": "scapegoat libel jew jewish holocaust", "socre_distint": 5}

{"author": "Tatumisgod1022", "body": "Christianity was intent on replacing Judaism by making its own particular message universal. The New Testament was seen as fulfilling the \u201cOld\u201d Testament (the Hebrew Bible); Christians were the new\u00a0Israel, both in flesh and in spirit. The God of\u00a0justice\u00a0had been replaced by the God of love. Thus, some early Church Fathers taught that God had finished with the Jews, whose only purpose in history was to prepare for the arrival of his Son. According to this view, the Jews should have left the scene. Their continued survival seemed to be an act of stubborn defiance. Exile was taken as a sign of divine disfavour incurred by the Jews\u2019 denial that Jesus was the\u00a0Messiah\u00a0and by their\u00a0role\u00a0in his crucifixion.\n\nAs Christianity spread in the first centuries\u00a0CE, most Jews continued to reject that\u00a0religion. As a consequence, by the 4th century, Christians tended to regard Jews as an\u00a0alien\u00a0people who, because of their repudiation of Christ and his church, were condemned to perpetual migration (a belief best illustrated in the\u00a0legend\u00a0of the\u00a0Wandering Jew). When the Christian church became dominant in the Roman Empire, its leaders inspired many\u00a0laws by Roman emperors\u00a0designed to segregate Jews and curtail their freedoms when they appeared to threaten Christian religious domination. As a consequence, Jews were increasingly forced to the margins of European society.\n\nEnmity\u00a0toward the Jews was expressed most acutely in the church\u2019s teaching of\u00a0contempt. From\u00a0St. Augustine\u00a0in the 4th century to\u00a0Martin Luther\u00a0in the 16th, some of the most\u00a0eloquent\u00a0and persuasive Christian theologians\u00a0excoriated\u00a0the Jews as rebels against God and murderers of the Lord. They were described as companions of the Devil and a\u00a0race\u00a0of vipers. Church liturgy, particularly the scriptural readings for the\u00a0Good Friday\u00a0commemoration of the Crucifixion, contributed to this enmity. Such views were finally renounced by the\u00a0Roman Catholic Church\u00a0decades after the Holocaust with the\u00a0Vatican II\u00a0declaration of\u00a0Nostra aetate\u00a0(Latin: \u201cIn Our Era\u201d) in 1965, which transformed Roman Catholic teaching regarding Jews and Judaism.\n\nReligious attitudes were reflected in the economic, social, and political life of\u00a0medieval\u00a0Europe. In much of Europe during the Middle Ages, Jews were denied\u00a0citizenship\u00a0and its rights, barred from holding posts in government and the military, and excluded from membership in guilds and the professions. To be sure, some European rulers and societies, particularly during the early Middle Ages, afforded Jews a degree of\u00a0tolerance\u00a0and acceptance, and it would be an error to conceive of Jews as facing an unchanging and unceasing\u00a0manifestation\u00a0of anti-Jewish oppression throughout this period. In 1096, however, knights of the\u00a0First Crusade\u00a0unleashed a wave of anti-Semitic violence in France and the\u00a0Holy Roman Empire, including massacres in Worms, Trier (both now in Germany), and Metz (now in France). Unfounded accusations of ritual murder and of host desecration and the\u00a0blood libel\u2014allegations of Jews\u2019 sacrifice of Christian children at Passover to obtain blood for unleavened bread\u2014appeared in the 12th century. The most famous example of these accusations, that of the murder of William of Norwich, occurred in England, but these accusations were revived sporadically in eastern and central Europe throughout the medieval and modern periods. In the 1930s the blood libel became part of Nazi\u00a0propaganda. Another instrument of 12th-century anti-Semitism, the compulsory\u00a0yellow badge that identified the wearer as a\u00a0Jew, was also revived by the Nazis. The practice of segregating the Jewish populations of towns and cities into\u00a0ghettos\u00a0dates from the Middle Ages and lasted until the 19th and early 20th centuries in much of Europe.\n\nAs European commerce grew in the late Middle Ages, some Jews became prominent in\u00a0trade, banking, and\u00a0moneylending, and Jews\u2019 economic and cultural successes tended to arouse the envy of the populace. This economic resentment, allied with traditional religious\u00a0prejudice, prompted the forced expulsion of Jews from several countries and regions, including England (1290), France (14th century), Germany (1350s), Portugal (1496), Provence (1512), and the\u00a0Papal States\u00a0(1569). Intensifying persecution in Spain culminated in 1492 in the forced expulsion of that country\u2019s large and long-established Jewish population. Only Jews who had converted to Christianity were allowed to remain, and those suspected of continuing to practice\u00a0Judaism\u00a0faced persecution in the Spanish\u00a0Inquisition. As a result of these mass expulsions, the centres of Jewish life shifted from western Europe and Germany to\u00a0Turkey\u00a0and then to Poland and\u00a0Russia.\n\nBut where they were needed, Jews were tolerated. Living as they did at the margins of society, Jews performed economic functions that were vital to trade and commerce. Because premodern Christianity did not permit moneylending for interest and because Jews generally could not own land, Jews played a vital\u00a0roleas moneylenders and traders. Where they were permitted to participate in the larger society, Jews thrived. During the Middle Ages in\u00a0Spain, before their expulsion in 1492, Jewish philosophers, physicians, poets, and writers were among the leaders of a rich cultural and\u00a0intellectual\u00a0life shared with Muslims and Christians. In collaboration with\u00a0Arab\u00a0scholars and thinkers in the tolerant society of Muslim Spain, they were instrumental in transmitting the intellectual heritage of the Classical world to medieval Christendom.\n\nThe idea that the Jews were evil persisted during the\u00a0Protestant Reformation. Although\u00a0Martin Lutherexpressed positive feelings about Jews, especially earlier in his life, and relied on Jewish scholars for his translation of the Hebrew scriptures into German, he became furious with Jews over their rejection of\u00a0Jesus. \u201cWe are at fault for not slaying them,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRather we allow them to live freely in our midst despite their murder, cursing, blaspheming, lying and defaming.\u201d Such views were emphasized by the\u00a0Nazis.

Since third-position ideologies are heavily demonized by the government, media and the deliberate decline in the overall quality of the public education system combined with the toxic aspects of the economy such as the vice industry, they tend to attract a lot of the wrong kinds of people who end up serving as useful idiots and therefore make these ideologies appear even worse than they're already portrayed by the consolidated mainstream media, government and academia.\n\nIf you ever wondered why the vice industry and cultural degeneration it causes really began to pick up stream in the 1920s, especially from the 1960s onward, is because dissolves the moral fabric of society and the cultural cohesion that holds it together; one's own pursuit of pleasure and material gain becomes their main focus, any real sense of patriotism and in-group loyalty is eroded by artificial pop culture that places hedonism on a pedestal. I'm not against people pursuing their dreams and passions, however radical individualism to the point that their own people suffer because is harmful and ends up rendering us easier to exploit.\n\nThere is a difference between being a mindless member of the crowd and being an individual while at the same time maintaining cultural cohesiveness with one's own people. Jews thrive because they form a tight cohesive group that aggressively pursues its own interests above everyone else, as is natural throughout history with any group. They've mastered the art of rhetoric and dominate the field of public relations (propaganda), any ideology that threatens the usurious grip of their banking elite is a threat to their mastery over their hosts.\n\nThe symbolic meaning of the Fasces bundle of sticks with its origins in ancient Rome come to mind \u2013 Imagine of people were sticks, a single stick is easy to break, but the Fasces bundle of sticks is much harder to snap in half.

{"author": "commiespaceinvader", "awarders": [], "body": "This is not a misunderstanding. This claim concerning Luk\u00e1cs by adherents of the anti-semitic conspiracy theory of \"cultural Marxism\" is not accidental but rather something done with utmost purpose. At the same time, it is almost hilarious how the reproduction of this claim about Luk\u00e1cs and the Hungarian Soviet Republic by modern day believers in the existence of \"cultural Marxism\" reveals the fascist intellectual roots of those beliefs and their underlying ideology. More on the insidious shit that is the \"cultural marxism\" conspiracy theory more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5gm75q/where_did_the_frankfurt_school_cultural_marxism/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4ivbfo/were_the_original_members_of_the_frankfurt_school/) by /u/kieslowskifan and myself.\n\nFirst: Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs, also known as George Luk\u00e1cs. Luk\u00e1cs is generally best known as a prominent Marxist philosopher, literary historian and theorist of aesthetics. Especially his early theoretical works are his best known for it was them that were taken up by his contemporaries Theordor Adorno and May Horkheimer in their development of what would eventually become the Frankfurt School as well as by other philosophers who would develop what is known \u2013 in my opinion somewhat wrongly named \u2013 Western Marxism. Western Marxism describes a philosophy of Marxism that developed originally after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and stood in opposition to both methods and distinct form as well as socialist model advocated by the Soviets, first under Lenin and then specifically under Stalin. Luk\u00e1cs together with German colleague Karl Korsch and their respective works *History and Class Consciousness: Studies in Marxist Dialectics* (written by Luk\u00e1cs in 1923) and *Marxism and Philosophy* (published by Korsch also in 1923). Their theory, primarily, aimed at highlighting the Hegelian aspects of Marxism, stressing its dialectics, focusing on processes such as reification, and understanding Marxism as a Marxism as a critique and a self-conscious transformation of society.\n\nLuk\u00e1cs' opposition to the Soviet model was heavily criticized in official communist circles, especially the Third Internationale. Lenin and others such as Zinovev denounced it as \"ultra leftism\" and highlighting the wrong aspects of Marx's writing. Luk\u00e1cs would go on to see himself forced into exile in the Soviet Union but managed to escape the Stalinist terror narrowly. He would then go on to be involved in post-war Hungary's socialist transformation though he still kept his contrarian streak as he was majorly involved in the Hungarian uprising of 1956 where an attempt by Hungarian socialist Imre Nagy to transform the Hungarian regime and open it up was crushed by Soviet tanks (something for which Luk\u00e1cs was celebrated \u2013 almost ironically \u2013 by American conservative commentators back then). He was then deported to Romania and for the second time in his life narrowly escaped execution. He would go on to return to Budapest, be exiled from the communist party but still work on his theoretical work until his death in 1971, though he was still openly critical of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and openly said so.\n\nNow, Luk\u00e1cs early position on the failures of Bolshevik style socialism and Leninist theory can be traced back almost directly to his own involvement in the short lived Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919. When B\u00e9la Kun and the communist party seized power in the post-war revolutionary wave, Luk\u00e1cs \u2013 who at the time was already an established cultural theorist who had spent hist time with Max Weber f.ex. \u2013 was People's Commissar for Education and Culture as deputy to the Commissar for Education Zsigmond Kunfi. This lasted only a short time. The Soviet Republic in Hungary lasted from 21 March to 1 August 1919 and already in May Luk\u00e1cs became the political commissar of the 5th Hungarian Red Army Division in the Hungarian civil war following the establishment of the Soviet Republic.\n\nIt was during this time that Luk\u00e1cs wrote one article in which he agitated for revolutionary violence (\"The possession of the power of the state is also a moment for the destruction of the oppressing classes. A moment, we have to use.\" \u2013 as he wrote in one article in the socialist newspaper N\u00e9pszava). It was also during the time of the Republic that Luk\u00e1cs participated in violence. It's historically proven \u2013 and Luk\u00e1cs would later talk openly about it \u2013 that as political commissar he ordered six of the soldiers of his division shot \u2013 a decision that as he himself would later go on to say, he regretted and that lead him to think intensively about developing a model of Marxist revolutionary theory that was different and in opposition to the Bolshevik model he himself participated in.\n\nBut on to the meat of the question: During his two months (March-May 1919) as People's Commissar for Education and Culture Lukacs did indeed change the school curriculum (he also famously socialized classical theaters): He replaced Catholic religious education with sociology and introduced sex education in Hungarian schools for the first time. There are two sources describing in more detail what form that took: Historian Werner Jung's work on Luk\u00e1cs published in 1989 and sociologists Michael L\u00f6wy's George Luk\u00e1cs - from romanticism to Bolshevism. published in 1979.\n\nWhat they described as the content of the sex education classes introduced by Luk\u00e1cs is fairly tame by European standard of modern sex ed, which is rather unsurprising given that we are talking about the early 20th century here. Instead of pornography, it consisted of explaining human reproductive organs, introducing students to safe sex and talking about sex outside of the structure of human reproduction as something that people do for pleasure. Which is a far cry from pornography, \"denouncing the family\" and such things.\n\nHowever, anti-semitic, fascist, and similarly reactionary took up Luk\u00e1cs short lived tenure extremely early in its existance. In fact, a whole lot of propaganda against the Hungarian Soviet Republic was based on the conspiracy of Bolshevism being a Jewish conspiracy to destroy the superior white race and all it held dear. \"The Jews Kun, Rothziegel, and Luk\u00e1cs\" were early figures of this whole slew of anti-semitic propaganda inside and outside of Hungary and took on an almost myth-like quality in how evil they were portrayed, only really eclipsed by Lenin and Trotsky themselves. Austrian newspapers would write about one of the most famous Austrian authors of the early 20th century, Egon Erwin Kisch, only in terms of the \"Jew Kisch\" and his connections to the \"Jews Kun and Luk\u00e1cs\" still in 1929 and beyond so deep was the hatred for the Hungarian Soviet Republic and its proponents.\n\nNext to the various authoritarian, extreme right-wing, and fascist movements that spread this particular form of hatred, another major proponent of the \"Jewish Bolshevism\" conspiracy myth \u2013 that would later go on to become the most central foundation of Nazism \u2013 was the Catholic Church. And it was them who started early with the myth of George Luk\u00e1cs coming to destroy the minds of Hungarian children with pornography. The first appearance of these claims can be traced back to Catholic newspapers published with Church money during the Horthy regime in Hungary (the reactionary regime that toppled the Hungarian Soviet Republic with help from the Romanians).\n\nIt was these claims that Hungarian emigr\u00e9es picked up during the post-war era and used as ammunition against the theories of Adorno and Horkheimer or Luk\u00e1cs himself. The claim of Luk\u00e1cs \"evil sex ed\" was popularized in the English-speaking world by Hungarian emigre and professor of political science at Maryland University, Victor Zitta, who in one of his works about Luk\u00e1sc and his biography relied almost exclusively on official histories of the Hungarian post-war period by the Horthy regime \u2013 a regime known for its anti-Semitic and fascist policies and for its collaboration with Nazi Germany.\n\nThis was right around the time, Pat Buchanan and William S. Lind re-discrovered the old Nazi Bolshevism as a Jewish conspiracy and Cultural Bolshevism conspirarcy theories and introduced them to the American right-wing discourse. And they ate up claims like the ones made by the Horthy regime and propagated post-war by emigres like Zitta. The more Jewish intellectuals like Adorno, Horkheimer and Luk\u00e1cs could be made out as evil and eating children, the better for them.\n\nFrom there the myth of \"cultural marxism\" spread and the lie about Luk\u00e1cs pornography along with it. And so it was picked up by the European Neo-Nazi scene, the identitarians, the alt-right, and \u2013 famously \u2013 mass murder Anders Breivik who mentioned \"cultural marxism\" in his manifesto. Like \"Judeo-Bolshevism\" and \"cultural Bolshevism\" of the Nazis of old, the modern day Nazis and their reactionary allies are able to use \"cultural bolshevism\" as the scapegoat for all that they perceive as challenging to them and their racist utopia of society: The reactionary front from Breivik to Jordan Peterson, from Viktor Orban to Paul Jospeh Watson will use \"cultural marxism\" as the underlying basis for everything from feminism to post-modernism, when really it is just a dog whistle for what they really mean: anti-semitic conspirarcy theory.\n\nAnd this is why people will say, George Luk\u00e1cs peddled pornography to children in 1919, despite the fact that it is clearly not true and most of these people will most likely have never read anything about or by Luk\u00e1cs.", "score": 22, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "date_year_month": "2019-06", "created_utc_converted": "2019-06-11 08:20:07", "score_overall": 12, "words": "conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy jewish conspiracy jew jewish conspiracy jewish conspiracy jewish scapegoat", "shared_words": "conspiracy jewish jew scapegoat", "socre_distint": 4}

But if you read the text, you'd read that they're actually \"just\" about \"anti-Zionism\". The spider-Jew actually has \"Zionism\" written on his back. Their authors, and the Soviet regime at large, would deny that the Star of David, the hook noses, and the classic Nazi symbolism of octopuses and spiders, is anything but legitimate criticism of Israel. The same goes for when they denied the holocaust (either by minimizing the Jewish casualties, or claiming it was a Zionist plot all along), or when they revived classic antisemitic myths like the Jews controlling the media, the banks and the Western governments. The moment it's in the service of \"anti-Zionism\", all antisemitism suddenly became kosher.\n\nAnd on the other side of the map, actual Neo-Nazis revel in this ambiguity to this day. \"Zionist\" as a code word for \"Jew\" or \"Jew-lover\" existed in the American Neo-Nazi parlance since at least the 1970's, and the idea of the [Zionist Occupation Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_Occupation_Government_conspiracy_theory).

Yet from my point of view you\u2019ve managed to miss the forest for the trees. The Eldian = Jew parallel is destroyed because Jews don\u2019t turn into giant man eating monsters when injected with spinal fluid. And not even gobbels would be able to sell that as a lie. \n\nSo the difference in this story is that people do have a legitimate, direct reason to fear the Eldian race that isn\u2019t political or social, it\u2019s far more basic than that. Nobody wants to get eaten alive. Which goes far beyond any kind of \u201cconspiracy\u201d.\n\nThat already deletes the premise of the entire argument but let\u2019s keep going.\n\nFirstly, in my opinion, Marley is NOT Germany, lthey are more of a hybrid of Italy/America, it is the Eldians who are the hybrid German/Japanese in the story. Marley uses Italian names, Italian weaponry, has similar technological deficiencies like 1930s Italy and even consume a meditarranian, seafood based cruisine. Hell, they even like coffee which must be brewed even on the road. All we need is the mafia and pizza and we have the full truck load of Italian stereotypes.\n\nEldia? Advanced in science, \u201cbelieved in eugenics\u201d, royal family across the pond in Marley are Eldian, like how every royal family (even now) is german. Great at engineering (basically already made the panzerfaust with the thunder spears), German architecture, German names. They just left the Hugo boss uniforms and tiger tanks behind. So you are likely right, they are probably German.\n\nAre there Jews in this story? Not really, apart from Levi Ackermann being an almost stereotypically Jewish name. \n\nSay you took away the armbands similarity to the Armbands used by the nazis. For me, the similarities between the holocaust and this situation dissipates entirely. Yes, there is racism and camps. Not exclusive to the nazis, there was plenty of racism in 1930s Europe. Internment camps were invented by the British. Or maybe they weren\u2019t, it could be an even older idea really.\n\nIf you studied japanese history, there are similar parallels. Or French history. Or to be frank, a lot of history. I don\u2019t feel that this is the point of the story. The story is examining the human condition that causes all these histories to repeat and happen in the first place. So if it\u2019s predictable and boring for you, that\u2019s great. It means isayama\u2019s examination of philosophy and humanity is 100% spot on.\n\nThe rest of us can appreciate how a seemingly simple story of black vs white can turn into a great philosophical dissection of what life is, while you can feel smug about \u201cknowing more than these kneelers\u201d.

Well let me tell you, friend, it's happening again. This is exactly how it started. They didn't start mass murdering Jews on day 1. They threw them in ghettos and in camps. They tore them apart from their families. They treated them like vermin. THEN they began experimenting on them. When the camps started getting too full they started shooting them after making them dig their own graves. When that wasn't efficient enough, they started gassing them en mass.\n\n8 stages of Genocide:  [http://www.genocidewatch.org/images/8StagesBriefingpaper.pdf](http://www.genocidewatch.org/images/8StagesBriefingpaper.pdf)\n\nEducate yourself. It doesn't start with mass murders. It stats with dehumanization and camps:\n\n**1. CLASSIFICATION:** All cultures have categories to distinguish people into \u201cus and them\u201d by ethnicity, race, religion, or nationality: German and Jew, Hutu and Tutsi. Bipolar societies that lack mixed categories, such as Rwanda and Burundi, are the most likely to have genocide. The main preventive measure at this early stage is to develop universalistic institutions that transcend ethnic or racial divisions, that actively promote tolerance and understanding, and that promote classifications that transcend the divisions. The Catholic church could have played this role in Rwanda, had it not been riven by the same ethnic cleavages as Rwandan society. Promotion of a common language in countries like Tanzania has also promoted transcendent national identity. This search for common ground is vital to early prevention of genocide.\n\n**2. SYMBOLIZATION:** We give names or other symbols to the classifications. We name people \u201cJews\u201d or \u201cGypsies\u201d, or distinguish them by colors or dress; and apply the symbols to members of groups. Classification and symbolization are universally human and do not necessarily result in genocide unless they lead to the next stage, dehumanization. When combined with hatred, symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of pariah groups: the yellow star for Jews under Nazi rule, the blue scarf for people from the Eastern Zone in Khmer Rouge Cambodia. To combat symbolization, hate symbols can be legally forbidden (swastikas) as can hate speech. Group marking like gang clothing or tribal scarring can be outlawed, as well. The problem is that legal limitations will fail if unsupported by popular cultural enforcement. Though Hutu and Tutsi were forbidden words in Burundi until the 1980\u2019s, code-words replaced them. If widely supported, however, denial of symbolization can be powerful, as it was in Bulgaria, where the government refused to supply enough yellow badges and at least eighty percent of Jews did not wear them, depriving the yellow star of its significance as a Nazi symbol for Jews.\n\n**3. DEHUMANIZATION:** One group denies the humanity of the other group. Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects or diseases. Dehumanization overcomes the normal human revulsion against murder. At this stage, hate propaganda in print and on hate radios is used to vilify the victim group. In combating this dehumanization, incitement to genocide should not be confused with protected speech. Genocidal societies lack constitutional protection for countervailing speech, and should be treated differently than democracies. Local and international leaders should condemn the use of hate speech and make it culturally unacceptable. Leaders who incite genocide should be banned from international travel and have their foreign finances frozen. Hate radio stations should be shut down, and hate propaganda banned. Hate crimes and atrocities should be promptly punished.\n\n**4. ORGANIZATION:** Genocide is always organized, usually by the state, often using militias to provide deniability of state responsibility (the Janjaweed in Darfur.) Sometimes organization is informal (Hindu mobs led by local RSS militants) or decentralized (terrorist groups.) Special army units or militias are often trained and armed. Plans are made for genocidal killings. To combat this stage, membership in these militias should be outlawed. Their leaders should be denied visas for foreign travel. The U.N. should impose arms embargoes on governments and citizens of countries involved in genocidal massacres, and create commissions to investigate violations, as was done in post-genocide Rwanda.\n\n**5. POLARIZATION:** Extremists drive the groups apart. Hate groups broadcast polarizing propaganda. Laws may forbid intermarriage or social interaction. Extremist terrorism targets moderates, intimidating and silencing the center. Moderates from the perpetrators\u2019 own group are most able to stop genocide, so are the first to be arrested and killed. Prevention may mean security protection for moderate leaders or assistance to human rights groups. Assets of extremists may be seized, and visas for international travel denied to them. Coups d\u2019\u00e9tat by extremists should be opposed by international sanctions.\n\n**6. PREPARATION:** Victims are identified and separated out because of their ethnic or religious identity. Death lists are drawn up. Members of victim groups are forced to wear identifying symbols. Their property is expropriated. They are often segregated into ghettoes, deported into concentration camps, or confined to a famine-struck region and starved. At this stage, a Genocide Emergency must be declared. If the political will of the great powers, regional alliances, or the U.N. Security Council can be mobilized, armed international intervention should be prepared, or heavy assistance provided to the victim group to prepare for its self-defense. Otherwise, at least humanitarian assistance should be organized by the U.N. and private relief groups for the inevitable tide of refugees to come.\n\n**7. EXTERMINATION** begins, and quickly becomes the mass killing legally called \u201cgenocide.\u201d It is \u201cextermination\u201d to the killers because they do not believe their victims to be fully human. When it is sponsored by the state, the armed forces often work with militias to do the killing. Sometimes the genocide results in revenge killings by groups against each other, creating the downward whirlpool-like cycle of bilateral genocide (as in Burundi). At this stage, only rapid and overwhelming armed intervention can stop genocide. Real safe areas or refugee escape corridors should be established with heavily armed international protection. (An unsafe \u201csafe\u201d area is worse than none at all.) The U.N. Standing High Readiness Brigade, EU Rapid Response Force, or regional forces -- should be authorized to act by the U.N. Security Council if the genocide is small. For larger interventions, a multilateral force authorized by the U.N. should intervene. If the U.N. is paralyzed, regional alliances must act. It is time to recognize that the international responsibility to protect transcends the narrow interests of individual nation states. If strong nations will not provide troops to intervene directly, they should provide the airlift, equipment, and financial means necessary for regional states to intervene.\n\n**8. DENIAL** is the eighth stage that always follows a genocide. It is among the surest indicators of further genocidal massacres. The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves, burn the bodies, try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses. They deny that they committed any crimes, and often blame what happened on the victims. They block investigations of the crimes, and continue to govern until driven from power by force, when they flee into exile. There they remain with impunity, like Pol Pot or Idi Amin, unless they are captured and a tribunal is established to try them. The response to denial is punishment by an international tribunal or national courts. There the evidence can be heard, and the perpetrators punished. Tribunals like the Yugoslav or Rwanda Tribunals, or an international tribunal to try the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, or an International Criminal Court may not deter the worst genocidal killers. But with the political will to arrest and prosecute them, some may be brought to justice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLearn this. Understand it.

{"author": "bacongoodforme", "awarders": [], "body": "As a foundation of the universe, this doctrine would bring about the end of any order intellectually conceivable to man. And as, in this greatest of all recognizable organisms, the result of an application of such a law could only be chaos, on earth it could only be destruction for the inhabitants of this planet.\n\nIf, with the help of his Marxist creed, the Jew is victorious over the other peoples of the world, his crown will be the funeral wreath of humanity and this planet will, as it did thousands of years ago, move through the ether devoid of men.\n\nEternal Nature inexorably avenges the infringement of her commands.\n\nHence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord\n\nOn the \"Big Lie\" [p.134]\n\nAll this was inspired by the principle - which is quite true in itself - that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying. These people know only too well how to use falsehood for the basest purposes. From time immemorial, however, the Jews have known better than any others how falsehood and calumny can be exploited. Is not their very existence founded on one great lie, namely, that they are a religious community, where as in reality they are a race? And what a race! One of the greatest thinkers that mankind has produced has branded the Jews for all time with a statement which is profoundly and exactly true. Schopenhauer called the Jew \"The Great Master of Lies\". Those who do not realize the truth of that statement, or do not wish to believe it, will never be able to lend a hand in helping Truth to prevail.\n\nOn the Protocols of the Elders of Zion [p.279]\n\nTo what an extent the whole existence of this people is based on a continuous lie is shown incomparably by the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, so infinitely hated by the Jews. They are based on a forgery, the Frankfurter Zeitung moans and screams once every week: the best proof that they are authentic ... For once this book has become the common property of a people, the Jewish menace may be considered as broken.\n\nOn the Weapons of the Jews [pp. 293-296]\n\nHis unfailing instinct in such things scents the original soul (die urspruengliche Seele) in everyone, and his hostility is assured to anyone who is not spirit of his spirit. Since the Jew is not the attacked but the attacker, not only anyone who attacks passes as his enemy, but also anyone who resists him. But the means with which he seeks to break such reckless but upright souls is not honest warfare, but lies and slander.\n\nHere he stops at nothing, and in his vileness he becomes so gigantic that no one need be surprised if among our people the personification of the devil as the symbol of all evil assumes the living shape of the Jew.\n\nThe ignorance of the broad masses about the inner nature of the Jew, the lack of instinct and narrow-mindedness of our upper classes, make the people an easy victim for this Jewish campaign of lies.\n\nWhile from innate cowardice the upper classes turn away from a man whom the Jew attacks with lies and slander, the broad masses from stupidity or simplicity believe everything. The state authorities either cloak themselves in silence or, what usually happens, in order to put an end to the Jewish press campaign, they persecute the unjustly attacked, which, in the eyes of such an official ass, passes as the preservation of state authority and the safeguarding of law and order.\n\nSlowly fear and the Marxist weapon of Jewry descend like a nightmare on the mind and soul of decent people.\n\nThey begin to tremble before the terrible enemy and thus have become his final victim.\n\nThe Jew\u2019s domination in the state seems so assured that now not only can he call himself a Jew again, but he ruthlessly admits his ultimate national and political designs. A section of his race openly owns itself to be a foreign people, yet even here they lie. For while the Zionists try to make the rest of the world believe that the national consciousness of the Jew finds its satisfaction in the creation of a Palestinian state, the Jews again slyly dupe the dumb Goyim. It doesn\u2019t even enter their heads to build up a Jewish state in Palestine for the purpose of living there; all they want is a central organization for their international world swindle, endowed with its own sovereign rights and removed from the intervention of other states: a haven for convicted scoundrels and a university for budding crooks.\n\nIt is a sign of their rising confidence and sense of security that at a time when one section is still playing the German, Frenchman, or Englishman, the other with open effrontery comes out as the Jewish race.\n\nHow close they see approaching victory can be seen by the hideous aspect which their relations with the members of other peoples takes on.\n\nWith satanic joy in his face, the black-haired Jewish youth lurks in wait for the unsuspecting girl whom he defiles with his blood, thus stealing her from her people. With every means he tries to destroy the racial foundations of the people he has set out to subjugate. Just as he himself systematically ruins women and girls, he does not shrink back from pulling down the blood barriers for others, even on a large scale. It was and it is Jews who bring the Negroes into the Rhineland, always with the same secret thought and clear aim of ruining the hated white race by the necessarily resulting bastardization, throwing it down from its cultural and political height, and himself rising to be its master.\n\nFor a racially pure people which is conscious of its blood can never be enslaved by the Jew. In this world he will forever be master over bastards and bastards alone.\n\nAnd so he tries systematically to lower the racial level by a continuous poisoning of individuals.\n\nAnd in politics he begins to replace the idea of democracy by the dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nIn the organized mass of Marxism he has found the weapon which lets him dispense with democracy and in its stead allows him to subjugate and govern the peoples with a dictatorial and brutal fist.\n\nHe works systematically for revolutionization in a twofold sense: economic and political.\n\nAround peoples who offer too violent a resistance to attack from within he weaves a net of enemies, thanks to his international influence, incites them to war, and finally, if necessary, plants a flag of revolution on the very battlefields.\n\nIn economics he undermines the states until the social enterprises which have become unprofitable are taken from the state and subjected to his financial control.\n\nIn the political field he refuses the state the means for its self-preservation, destroys the foundations of all national self-maintenance and defense, destroys faith in the leadership, scoffs at its history and past, and drags everything that is truly great into the gutter.\n\nCulturally, he contaminates art, literature, the theater, makes a mockery of natural feeling, overthrows all concepts of beauty and sublimity, of the noble and the good, and instead drags men down into the sphere of his own base nature.\n\nReligion is ridiculed, ethics and morality represented as outmoded, until the last props of a nation in its struggle for existence in this world have fallen.\n\nNow begins the great last revolution. In gaining political power the Jew casts off the few cloaks that he still wears. The democratic people\u2019s Jew becomes the blood-Jew and tyrant over peoples. In a few years he tries to exterminate the national intelligentsia and by robbing the peoples of their natural intellectual leadership makes them ripe for the slave\u2019s lot of permanent subjugation.\n\nThe most frightful example of this kind is offered by Russia, where he killed or starved about thirty million people with positively fanatical savagery, in part amid inhuman tortures, in order to give a gang of Jewish journalists and stock exchange bandits domination over a great people.\n\nThe end is not only the end of the freedom of the peoples oppressed by the Jew, but also the end of this parasite upon the nations. After the death of his victim, the vampire sooner or later dies too.\n\nOn the Use of Propoganda [Chapter 6]\n\nThe function of propaganda does not lie in the scientific training of the individual, but in calling the masses' attention to certain facts, processes, necessities, etc., whose significance is thus for the first time placed within their field of vision ...\n\nAll propaganda must be popular and its intellectual level must be adjusted to the most limited intelligence among those it is addressed to. Consequently, the greater the mass it is intended to reach, the lower its purely intellectual level will have to be. But if, as in propaganda for sticking out a war, the aim is to influence a whole people, we must avoid excessive intellectual demands on our public, and too much caution cannot be extended in this direction.", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "HistoryMemes", "date_year_month": "2019-06", "created_utc_converted": "2019-06-20 05:40:09", "score_overall": 24, "words": "jew jew jew jewish jew jew jew jewish cowardice jew jewish jew jew jew goyim jewish jewish jewish jew jew jew jew jewish jew", "shared_words": "jew jewish cowardice goyim", "socre_distint": 4}

Of course I would flee the country, I'm oviously not welcome here and everyone seems to be turning on me just to find a escapegoat. What's worse, the current government seems to be encouraging this. \n\nAlso, I don't have to leave all my assets if I can just smuggle them out of there. What's important is to keep my family alive. \n\nAnd about the others like me who are also potential escapegoats, I would advise them to take their chance too; Things are very likely to get worse in the near future given there's a crazy power tripper in power. Temporary or not, staying isn't worth risking our lives. You can't possibly predict something as big as the holocaust, but you can indeed predict that violence will escalate.\n\nJust look at the current situation in south africa, wich is mostly the same: A crazy power tripper who is blaming people like you for every problem in the nation. A lot of boers (which has a meaning as innocent as \"white farmer\") have already fled the country and settled somewhere else even before the murders started, and the remaining ones have moved themselves into self-made concentration camps where they can at least keep watch over each other to avoid conflicts while they wait for help leaving the country.\n\nAnd they got it, Australia is willing to take them in and even give them citizenship free of charge. Boers have truly dodged a bullet here.\n\nAnd for me, I'm pretty lucky. Violence is mostly allowed toward white argentinians, but the government isn't officially endorsing it, and there's still a fa\u00e7ade of trying to minimise crime. So I moved from a medium city to a small town, and let me tell you I feel a lot safer here.

To see if Antisemitism is ok or not, we need to listen to antisemites and judge which of their conspiracy theories are more or less ok as a rationale for hatred and murder? This isn't \"which color shirt goes best with blue pants\" or \"do bonds pay off in the long run, yes or no.\"**\n\n&gt;so we can actually tackle the issues at their roots.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They refuse to be debunked because nobody will talk to them in a constructive manner. \n\n**We've tried and it didn't work. Like, so so so many times. Google \"Disputation of Barcelona\" or \"Dezanification of Germany.\" You're bringing a decades-perspective knife to a millennia-long gun fight.**\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a problem characteristic of modern politics as a whole. People ensconce themselves in groups with people who agree with them and enter illogical spirals and end up coming to poor conclusions, then becoming incandescent when they meet people who disagree with them, which instantly denies any possibility of proper debate or mind changing. Personally I don\u2019t believe anybody who holds such abhorrent viewpoints is inherently bad - I believe there will be a cause for their perspective which can be addressed, and should be addressed to help alleviate the problems. \n\n**The \"problem to be addressed\" which has led to antisemitism in the past and the roots of it today have included no less than: the collapse of the Roman Empire, the Black Death, Modernity itself, and pretty much Every Wartime Ever.**\n\n&gt;Blistering and censorship will achieve nothing, as making things forbidden is not a universal solution.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The nature of anti semitism has also changed over time too.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**\\[**The 20th century is an excellent example, as it has highlighted the issue, created a new cause for the problem but also strengthened people against racism,**\\]**\n\n**\\^ I have no idea what you're arguing about here. The whole \"Israel is bad\" thing isn't new. It existed before the 1940s.

Saying it hasn\u2019t changed as an issue is factually incorrect and I suspect you know that.\n\n**The fact that the left is guilty of antisemitism too is a great point, but it is not a new phenomenon by any means.**\n\n&gt;Furthermore, nothing is lost to you either. If you can\u2019t convince them, well, they\u2019re going to be an anti Semite anyway (as they were before) and will do whatever they would before the altercation. If you convince them or else cause them doubt, they might stop.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Essentially, your being a Jew does not mean you instantly understand all issues pertaining to this topic, and it can in fact result in you being blinded to solutions purely by your own indignation and outrage.**\n\n**Ok, I don't like saying things like this, but eff you. Seriously.** \n\n**How about: many non-Jews have great perspective on anti-semitism because they can see or hear about it from Jews, but they, like any group not subjected to a particular type of racism, don't and can't fully understand the depths and forms of that particular racism because it is not a salient and everyday part of their cultural landscape.** \n\n&gt;It takes real mettle to bite the bullet and overcome vitriol to elucidate a rational point calmly, but it is worth the effort to do so, as it defuses tension and change minds, rather than instigate an emotional shouting contest.\n\n**Please stop tone policing me and telling me not to have the valid emotions this topic causes me, or to spare you the expression of them.** \n\n&gt;The way we get past racism is not by strongly categorising everyone by race and religion, but by recognising that that is exactly the problem. We can\u2019t consider people merely a product of their genetics or singular ideology, \n\n**Ok.** \n\n&gt;because all people are then is a representation of those things, and you grow to hate them for things that they haven\u2019t done, may not have considered , or may be in too fragmented a state of mind to ever understand properly. **You don\u2019t see why they believe things, only what they believe, and if you hate that, you hate them as a result.**\n\n**I fully know why they believe what they believe, but you seem to think I'm 100% nonsense and have no facts or understanding about this topic because I've expressed emotion. I \"pass\" where I grew up and have literally been handed white militia propaganda at a state fair. I read the flier. Apparently the Jews are part of a globalist conspiracy to deprive good and true white people of their proper economic due in life.

What matters is how dangerous these subpopulations are relative to each other so the government can allocate resources to prevent the greatest number of murders possible. Thus, enforcing immigration law more harshly is an ineffective way to punish a population that is less likely to murder or commit crimes than native-born Americans. Illegal immigrants, non-citizens, and legal immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated, convicted, or arrested for crimes than native-born Americans are. \n\n&gt;\n\nThe Washington Post compiled statistical charts that indicate the Trump administration is lying when they claim illegal immigration is a crisis. They disprove Trump's lies including immigrants flooding the border (they're not), that they bring crime (they don't), and that they're a drain on the economy (they aren't).^[[2]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/21/theres-no-immigration-crisis-and-these-charts-prove-it/?utm_term=.5a93c2cb02fa)\n\n&gt;The administration has said that the country is in danger of being \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by \u201cmassive increases in illegal crossings\u201d that will bring \u201chorrible crime,\u201d \u201cunbelievably great taxpayer expense\u201d and the loss of American jobs.\n\nNone of those claims are true.\n\n&gt;...Here's what we can say in conclusion. Current rates of illegal immigration remain extremely low by historic standards. Legal and undocumented immigrants are significantly less likely to commit most crimes than native-born citizens, making them a net benefit to public safety.

He doesn\u2019t have a chance in hell of unseating Putin, of course, but the presence of racists like him in the race are useful to allow voters to blow off some steam.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the Kremlin\u2019s international propaganda channel, Russia Today, which routinely hosts Holocaust deniers and conspiracy theorists as respectable commentators.\n\nThey don\u2019t actually spout anti-Semitism on their broadcasts: They have other outlets to do that, like the fringe website Russia Insider, which recently ran a 5,000-word article titled [\u201cIt\u2019s Time to Drop the Jew Taboo.\u201d](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-pro-putin-trolls-court-u-s-alt-right-with-hardcore-anti-semitism-1.5770080) RT and other official wings of the Kremlin maintain a minimal distance from this sort of stuff, but the community of xenophobes and anti-Semites who find sanctuary and swear allegiance to Putin\u2019s Russia are his fellow travelers.\n\nPutin may not be an anti-Semite himself. In fact, nearly all of the evidence points in the opposite direction. But he is fine with anti-Semitic allies, as long as they boost his anti-Western narrative. They are an integral part of the cocktail of nationalism, chauvinism and bigotry buttressing Putin\u2019s base at home, and exciting his growing community of supporters on the far left and far right in the West.\n\nLast July, Putin said the allegations about Russian-meddling in the U.S. elections \u201creminds me of anti-Semitism.

Whether Solzhenitsyn was antisemitic?\n\nLobsters tend not to have heard of Solzhenitsyn before Peterson came along, but he's been the posterboy for conservative intellectuals since the 1970s. An apartheid loving, uber Christian (or Russian Orthodox) who fawned over Franco and other fascists, he's always attracted a certain type. Indeed, it's telling that before Peterson wrote a forward for \"The Gulag Archipelago's\", the previous forwards were by psychos from the Hoover Institution, and other big business think tanks.\n\nMeanwhile, here are actual historians on Peterson's favorite bash-a-~~Jew~~\\-commie author:\n\n\"Historian [Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohanan_Petrovsky-Shtern)  of Northwestern University published a refutation of Solzhenitsyn's  claims and has accused him of anti-Semitism.  \\[...\\] Solzhenitsyn falsely  claims Jews were overrepresented in the early [Bolshevik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevik)   leadership and the security apparatus, without citing his sources.  \\[...\\] Historian Richard Pipes has accused Solzhenitsyn's nationalism of  preventing him from being fully impartial, and that Solzhenitsyn uses  outdated  and inadequate sources. Pipes asserts that Solzhenitsyn failed  to  consider the \"poisonous atmosphere in which Jews lived for  generations  in the Russian empire (an atmosphere originating in Russian  Orthodox and  nationalist circles)\".\n\n\\[...\\] Solzhenitsyn was accused by the [Northwestern University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University) historian [Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohanan_Petrovsky-Shtern)   of using unreliable and manipulated figures, while ignoring evidence   unfavorable to his own point of view and, in particular, ignoring   numerous publications of reputable authors in Jewish history. Petrovsky  says that Solzhenitsyn claims that Jews promoted alcoholism  among the  peasantry, flooded the retail trade with contraband, and  \"strangled\"  the Russian merchant class in Moscow. He says that according to  Solzhenitsyn, Jews are parasitic, non-producing people (\"\u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\")  and refuse to engage in factory labor. They are averse to agriculture  and unwilling to till the land either in Russia, in Argentina, or in  Palestine, and the author blames the Jews' own behavior for pogroms. He  says that Solzhenitsyn also claims that Jews used [Kabbalah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah)  to tempt Russians into heresy, seduced Russians with rationalism and  fashion, provoked sectarianism and weakened the financial system,  committed murders on the orders of [qahal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qahal)  authorities, and exerted undue influence on the prerevolutionary  government. Petrovsky summarizes his critique by stating that \"*200 Years Together* is destined to take a place of honor in the canon of russophone antisemitica.\"\n\n\\[...\\] A critical analysis was published by historian [Semyon Reznik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semyon_Reznik).   According to Reznik Solzhenitsyn condones repressive measures  against Jews, and justifies them as intended for protection of the  rights of Russians  as the [titular nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titular_nation)   that supposedly \"greatly suffered from Jewish exploitation, alcohol   mongering, usury and corruption of the traditional way of life\".\n\n\\[...\\] Historian and demographer Sergey Maksudov referred to Solzhenitsyn's work as  \"a piece of pseudoscientific essayism\", which promulgates numerous   antisemitic stereotypes of Jews as professional parasites, infiltrators   into the Russian culture, and portrays repressive policies toward Jews   as being \"in Jews' own interests\". Maksudov also claims that   Solzhenitsyn was insensitive toward Jewish sufferings during [pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom) in general, and the [Kishinev pogrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kishinev_pogrom) in particular, and also accuses Solzhenitsyn of denying many well documented atrocities.\n\n\\[...\\] [John Klier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Klier), a historian at [University College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London),  writes that in his account of the pogroms of the early 20th  century,  Solzhenitsyn is far more concerned with exonerating the good  name of  the Russian people than he is with the suffering of the Jews,  and he  accepts the tsarist government's canards blaming the pogroms on   provocations by the Jews themselves. \\[...\\] A detailed analysis of *THYT* and an overview of critical opinion thereon was published by the [University of Waterloo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Waterloo)   professor Zinaida Gimpelevich. According to Gimpelevich, the critical   opinion worldwide overwhelmingly tilts against Solzhenitsyn.\n\n\\[...\\] [Grigory Baklanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Baklanov), a Russian novelist, in his critical study described Solzhenitsyn's work as \"worthless as historical scholarship\". Baklanov, himself a [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II)   veteran, focuses on Solzhenitsyn's insistence on Jews' supposed  wartime  cowardice and unwillingness to face the enemy, which he says is   contradicted both by the statistics of Jewish frontline casualties and   by the high number of Jews decorated for bravery in battle.\n\n\\[...\\] Literary historian [Leonid Katsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leonid_Katsis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1)   accuses Solzhenitsyn of numerous manipulated and selective quotations   in the first volume of the book, detrimental to its trustworthiness.  Cultural historian and comparatist Elisa Kriza discusses THYT in an   article about anti-Semitism in Solzhenitsyn's works and explains how   Solzhenitsyn's accusations towards Jewish people as a group and his   treatment of Russian Jews as \"foreign\", despite being in Russia for two   hundred years, are evidence of anti-Semitic rhetoric in the book.\n\n\\[...\\] Historians Leybelman, Levinskaya, and Abramov claim that  Solzhenitsyn uncritically used writings of antisemitic pseudo-historian [Andrey Dikiy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Dikiy) for his inflated statistical data of Jewish participation in the early Soviet government and its security apparatus.\n\n[Mark Deutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Deutch),  in a two-part review titled \"A Shameless Classic\" (\"\u0411\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0442\u044b\u0436\u0438\u0439  \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043a\"),lists numerous drawbacks, stemming, in his opinion, from  biased  exposition, ignoring well-known sources, self-contradictions,  and  factual errors.\"\n\nAnd [Saul Jay Singer](https://www.jewishpress.com/author/saul-jay-singer/): \"Textological experts concluded that *Two Hundred Years Together* and a vile anti-Semitic essay titled *Jews in the USSR and in the Future Russia* were incontestably written by Solzhenitsyn . \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\netc etc.\n\nBut I mean, you're on a board dedicated to a guy who lies about scientific studies (studies written by authors who diss him), quotes studies by race realists without telling his audience who the authors are, and retweets/interviews self described white nationalists.", "score": 5, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "JordanPeterson", "date_year_month": "2019-06", "created_utc_converted": "2019-06-28 19:21:39", "score_overall": 9, "words": "jew jewish merchant jewish jewish cowardice jewish jewish jewish", "shared_words": "jew jewish merchant cowardice", "socre_distint": 4}

{"associated_award": null, "author": "FormerlyPallas_", "awarders": [], "body": "Jewish friends are in despair about the Labour party\u2019s decision to readmit an MP who has repeatedly defended and endorsed candidates with a long history of anti-Semitism. He has downplayed and dismissed the experience of Jewish members who have experienced racism, and to date remains unapologetic. His behaviour has been described by many Jewish members as \u201cJew-baiting\u201d. Their concerns have been denied.\n\nOn Friday evening the party suspended the whip again, but this chain of events has prompted serious charges of political interference. The committee that ruled on readmitting Chris Williamson was convened as Labour prepares to select candidates for an anticipated general election, last minute changes were made to the panel, and one of its members later called for his own decision to be overturned. Call it conspiracy or call it chaos \u2014 this is now an existential threat to Labour.\n\nRacism is a disease. It does not exist in pockets. Unchallenged, it spreads and finds roots. In recent months, we have seen a rise in anti-Semitic attacks in the UK, a murder in France, attacks on synagogues in Sweden and the US and fascists on the march in \u200bPoland. As one Jewish constituent wrote to me, \u201cpeople are really frightened\u201d.\n\nSo often in history, Labour has been the hope for people who faced racism and one of the key agents in its defeat. For me, that is not historical fact; it is personal. My father was part of the small group of people who, facing that systematic discrimination himself, set up the Campaign against Racial Discrimination, wrote the Race Relations Act 1976 and established the Equal Opportunities Commission: this has had real, tangible benefits for me and my generation.\n\n\nThe Labour party ought to be a light on the hill for people in times of darkness but there is, as the chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust put it, \u201ca blind spot\u201d among some sections of the left when it comes to anti-Semitism.\n\nWhat do Holocaust denial, references to financiers of the sugar and slave trades and the horrific mural that depicted Jewish bankers profiting off the backs of the poor have in common? It is the demonisation of Jewish people as somehow wielding illegitimate power, which allows its proponents to deny any suffering \u2014 especially suffering on the scale of the Holocaust. It is a form of racism that instead of looking down, looks up and argues that this group is a legitimate target for a left that exists to fight oppression in all forms. That form of anti-Semitism in our party demands to be recognised.\n\nWe have no right to pick and choose the type of racism we confront.\n\nTo deal with all this demands concrete action. That is why this week\u2019s decision has been met with so much despair from Labour members, MPs and party staff. Last year Labour adopted a gold-standard definition of anti-Semitism. If it is to mean anything, it must be upheld. Resolving the reportedly thousands of complaints that are waiting to be heard and reinstating the longstanding and effective training for members that was cancelled this year are not optional extras.\n\nAs the Labour prime minister Harold Wilson once said, \u201cthe Labour party is a moral crusade or it is nothing\u201d. Most Labour party members, like me, joined the party because we abhor racism and discrimination every bit as much as we abhor poverty and oppression. We should empower our members to recognise, challenge and act on concerns because we are a party that seeks not just to run society, but to change it, and that places on us a particular responsibility to lead.\n\nThose things, taken together, would create a culture in which anti-Semitism could find no fertile ground. Anti-Semitism tells us that something is rotten in society. It is not enough for us to decry the shrill, sour, hopeless dog-whistle politics that we have heard from the Conservative party in recent years; we have to be better.
