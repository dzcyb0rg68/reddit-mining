{"archived": false, "author": "Sizzle50", "body": "The intrepid journalists at BuzzFeed have broken a new story on the bleeding edge of our total meme war:\n\n[Celebrities Say White Supremacists Used A New Video App To Trick Them Into Endorsing Anti-Jewish Conspiracy Theories](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellievhall/celebrities-white-supremacists-video-app-cameo-anti-semitic) (trimmed for the sake of brevity)\n\n&gt;A group of white supremacist YouTubers are using a new app to pay celebrities to create videos where they make coded anti-Semitic statements \u2014 and then the YouTubers use those recordings to promote hatred on the internet. The videos were made using [Cameo](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/arts/cameo-nikki-blonsky-now-you-can-just-pay-celebrities-to-say-stuff.html), where users can pay to have celebrities record a personalized message for them. Cameo launched in April 2018, and has become another platform that the far-right has seized upon in an attempt to legitimize racist messages \u2014 this time with seeming celebrity endorsements.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The group behind the videos refers to itself as the GDL, or Goyim Defense League, using the Hebrew word for a non-Jew. The group is apparently run by two YouTubers who go by \u201cHandsome Truth\u201d and \u201cSway Guevara.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In one recent video, former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre \u2014 one of the NFL\u2019s most legendary figures \u2014 addresses the group:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cBrett Favre here with a shoutout to the Handsome Truth and the GDL boys,\u201d Favre says in the shaky video. \u201cYou guys are patriots in my eyes. So keep waking them up and don\u2019t let the small get you down. Keep fighting, too, and don\u2019t ever forget the USS *Liberty* and the men and women who died on that day. God bless and take care.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The video is loaded with coded anti-Semitic language. For example, \u201csmall\u201d stands for \u201csmall hats,\u201d a slur for yarmulkes. The USS *Liberty* is a dog whistle referring to an incident in 1967 where Israeli forces fired on the US spy ship, [killing 34](https://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Explore/Notable-Graves/Casualties-of-War-and-Honorary-War-Veterans/USS-Liberty), during the Six-Day War. In the aftermath, Israel said that its pilots had thought the ship was an Egyptian vessel, and apologized \u2014 the government eventually paid out [$6.7 million](https://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-liberty_tuesoct02-story.html) in reparations to the survivors and families of the dead. Ever since, there have been unproven conspiracy theories surrounding the circumstances that question whether the attack was intentional. Both the Israeli and the United States governments have said that it was [a case of mistaken identity](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2003/02/01/the-attack-on-liberty/593e6872-aa67-422a-b24a-e5cebecb3cd6/?utm_term=.22479767c095).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Comedian Andy Dick also made a personalized message for another member of the GDL, who goes by the name \u201cSway Guevara\u201d on YouTube. According to the prices on [Dick\u2019s Cameo page](https://www.cameo.com/andydick), it cost $99.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cHey, Sway, shoutout to the GDL, hope you guys keep up the great work. Remember what happened that day on the USS *Liberty*. And keep our military troops\u2014\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The video cuts off at this point. It\u2019s unclear what prompted Dick to leave the message seemingly unfinished.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Rapper Soulja Boy also appears to have inadvertently made a video for the anti-Semitic group.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cShoutout to Handsome Truth and Sway at GDL,\u201d he says in the video, before telling viewers to check out their new single \u201cName the Juice\u201d on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/goyimdefenseleague/name-the-jew-sway-guevara-ft-ht-gdl) and to subscribe to Handsome Truth 14 on YouTube. \u201cGDL for life, bitch.\u201d\n\nAll celebrities mentioned in the article have apologized and renounced the Goyim Defense League, but it's interesting to see how the trend of duping celebrities into seemingly endorsing wanton 4channery is evolving.

{"archived": false, "author": "Morthra", "body": "&gt; Having a Jewish State is problematic, because it does imply that even if you're country is 100% a jewish population, priority goes to Jews nonetheless.\n\nIs it? The whole *point* of Israel is for it to be a Jewish state where Jews are the ethnic majority, because without exception, Jews are persecuted when they aren't, and this goes all the way back to the Babylonians, who destroyed the First Temple (the most important spiritual site to the Jews) in 587 BCE, and in the second century CE the Romans expelled the Jews from the region along with a huge spike in antisemitism among the Romans. \n\nJews didn't fare better in Europe either. On the tail end of the 6th century CE, the Visigoths (in what is now Spain), with support from the Catholic Church forbade Jews from marrying Christians, practicing circumcision, and observing Jewish holy days. In the decades that followed, Jews in the region were subject to forced conversion, slavery, exile, and execution.\n\nBetween the 9th century and 11th century the Jews lived as second class citizens in Spain (and the rest of the Muslim world), ending with several Muslim pogroms on the Iberian Peninsula, and decrees ordering the destruction of synagogues were enacted in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. Jews were forced to convert at sword point.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages persecution of the Jews was commonplace through blood libels (the belief that Jews use the blood of children to make matzo), exile, forced conversion, and outright genocide.\n\nThe Crusades didn't spare the Jews either. Hundreds to thousands of Jews were killed *by crusaders* in the First Crusade, which is what was cited by Zionists in the 19th century (which is when it first began as a movement) as the primary indicator of a need for a state of Israel. The Jews in Germany would later find themselves massacred during the Second Crusade in 1147, the Shepherds' Crusades of 1251 and 1320, and following that, the all Jews in England were banished, and 100,000 were banished in France. Most of the Jews such banished went to Poland.\n\nThen during the spread of the Black Plague through Europe during the 14th century, the Jews were made out to be a scapegoat (stating that the Jews deliberately caused the disease by poisoning wells), and while the Pope at the time was sympathetic, he was unable to stop nearly a thousand Jews being burned alive in Strasbourg alone.\n\nThis antisemitism was brought over to the colonies that would later become the US. The governor of New Amsterdam (now New York) created and implemented plans to prevent Jews from entering the city, and during the Colonial Era, the American government limited the political and economic rights of Jews. It wasn't until America gained its independence that Jews gained any legal rights.\n\nThen in the late 18th century the Russians, under Catherine the Great, banished their Jewish population to what is now Poland. Due to the high concentrations of Jews (and the fact that they were still part of Russia) pogroms and anti-Jew riots were common.\n\nIt wasn't until the Jews were slaughtered in the Holocaust that the world finally realized that yeah, something like this was bound to happen when Jews were an ethnic minority due to the fact that they tend to be insular and don't integrate into the local culture. Up until the establishment of Israel as a Jewish state, there was literally no nation in the world whose people didn't hate the Jews - and this had been the case for over 1000 years.\n\n&gt; Therefore, the only real solution is to get people on either side to expulse their extremist fringe elements who want to annihilate the other, and come to some sort of agreement that will let both communities live in peace, together. \n\nYou know what a better solution would be? For the Arab nations around Palestine, like Egypt, to accept Palestinian refugees, then kick all the Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank. Because antisemitism is culturally ingrained in pretty much all Palestinians, letting them into Israel en masse will just invite them to pass laws to persecute the Jews unless Israel turns into an apartheid state.", "score": 6, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "date_year_month": "2018-12", "created_utc_converted": "2018-12-02 08:29:11", "score_overall": 9, "words": "jewish jewish jewish jewish scapegoat jewish jew holocaust jewish", "shared_words": "jewish scapegoat jew holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}

The US gives funds equivalent to 5% of the IDF budget, small peanuts. Whereas, the host of the Palestinian colony is Mecca in Saudi Arabia.\n\n&gt; Firstly, while individual Islamic rulers during the middle ages or renaissance might have launched a pogrom here or there against the Jews, those occurrences were always of a very limited scale compared to what happened at the same time in the Christian world. \n\nA proclamation was written in Iran, sounding much like the story of Esther, where any citizen was allowed to kill every Jewish man, women and child unless they converted to Shia Islam. The edict was first put in place in Isfahan and later in all of Persia, between 1663 and 1666.\n\n1800's Palestinians committed ethnic cleansing and genocide in Jaffa (1876) and Jerusalem (1847, 1870 and 1895). \n\n&gt; the Islamic world was for centuries a safe haven for the Jewish diaspora.\n\nPre-Holocaust Europe had 6 million Jews and Pre-Holocaust Islamic lands had 900 thousand. If Muslims were so merciful then why did Jews go to Antisemitic Europe 6 to 1 over Islamic lands. Those 900 thousand Jews were kicked out of Islamic lands as soon as Israel was established and that is NOT limited scale.  Such a safe haven those Islamic lands! Get kicked out of your homeland because of some war that has nothing to do with you. \n\nLife for Jews while under a Muslim ruler were only wonderful for Muslims. They had a source of extortion money to fill the coffers, a minority to scapegoat (Beat Up) when they felt frustrated, and overall dominance over Jews - as mandated in the Quran.\n\n&gt; Traditional racism is not hard to find in Israel, and one doesn't even have to look at the treatment of Palestinians to find it.\n\nPalestinian is not a race. Racism exists in all societies but that does not discount the fact that Palestinians are not protesting regularly or at all about the issue of bigotry by Israelis.\n\nJudaism is not a race based religion and Zionism and its historical roots has no reference to admiring ashkanazi Jews or Whites. More then half of Israeli Jews are non-white.\n\nJews have always been considered non-white throughout history until some ideologue guesses that since Jews are successful that they must be white.\n\n&gt; and one doesn't even have to look at the treatment of Palestinians to find it.\n\nLet's get this straight, Arabs pioneered the African slave trade and still practice slavery with Asian indentured servitude. Palestinians pray to a white prophet whom had African slaves. Jews don't pray to someone who supports African slavery.\n\n&gt; Just look at the scandal where Ethiopian Jews were forcibly put on birth control to keep them from having children.\n\nThey were not forced, they were mislead. As soon as they protested or asked questions, the procedure was ended. That is free birth control not permanent sterilization. In America, we strive to consider free birth control a right.\n\nThe queen of Sheba, Ethiopia must have converted to Judaism under duress because Jews are so racist. /s\n\n&gt; and there is a clear hierarchy where Black Jews are worth the least.\n\nWhat is this proof of a hierarchy in Israeli education, housing, welfare subsidies? If its clear then there must be info.\n\n&gt; And this makes it okay to deny the Palestinians basic human rights\n\nThe Palestinians are not Israelis therefore civil rights are done by Palestinian authority and they are afforded border checkpoints only into Jerusalem. We have checkpoints in America at airports, borders, Disney World, and at high rises.\n\n&gt; The Israeli people votes for Netanyahu because he .... make(s) Islamic terrorism out to be an existential threat to Israel.\n\nHave you read the infamous Islamic Hadith which proclaims that the Muslim end times will come only when\n\n\u201cMuslims will fight the Jews (and kill them); until the Jews hide behind rocks and trees, which will cry: O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, come on and kill him!\u201d . \n\nIts author was not preaching the mass murder of Jews because of settlements in the West Bank, its merely Jew hate.\n\nA decade ago, Iran created the anti-Semitic rallying cry for Hezbollah and Houthis. The slogan is \u201cDeath to America, death to Israel, damnation to the Jews,\" Iran's hezbullah proxy leader Nasrallah said in '02. \"If Jews all gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of going after them worldwide.\"\n\nHitler made similar threats in Mein Kampf but they were largely ignored.\n\nNasrallah has a reputation for keeping his promises and Iran has a history of ethnically cleansing Jews.\n\n&gt; The Israel of today have such a blatant level of corruption and inequality between the citizens\n\nIsrael has had many Prime Ministers arrested and jailed because the corruption is faught and won by the citizens.

And hypocritical.  \n\n&gt;I didn't move the goalposts one bit. I wrote that this court case was a sham because the only point in case was the provision of evidence and the plaintiff literally provided nothing but a story. \n\nThat is what court cases are.  Two parties with different stories.  In lucky cases, both parties agree on a single story and only legal *interpretation* is needed.  \n\n&gt;The judge literally decided that no evidence was necessary in a challenge that was 100% predicated on evidence.\n\nAgain, this was a civil suit. Say I sue someone because they rear-ended me and drove off. I managed to snag a photo of their license plate, and my friend was in the car when it happened.  \n\nWhat evidence is there that any of this happened?  Two peoples' \"stories\" and a photo -- with a timestamp that probably could have been altered.  Maybe a police report.  \n\nThrough questioning the defendant, the judge could determine if he or she lived or worked in the area, if they drove that route, would have been on that road at that time, etc.  \n\nNow, if the defendant came to court with some receipts and credit card statements showing that they had been [elsewhere] at the time of the purported accident, the judge would probably throw the case out.  \n\nEvidence.  Testimony counts.  It won't beat out contradictory material evidence, but it's something.  And a hundred or more pages of *consistent, firsthand, eyewitness testimony* is just that.  \n\nAnd corroborating testimony from *millions* of people.  Victims, prisoners, soldiers from half a dozen countries, photographs, original Nazi documents detailing the numbers of people arriving, being killed, and even where their hair and belongings were being shipped.  \n\n&gt;Even you fail to provide any. \n\nSee any of the links in any of my previous comments.

Further, Jews around the world do not uniformly support the actions of the Israeli state. Many people from across the political spectrum, including Jews, have condemned Israel\u2019s burgeoning and strengthening apartheid state. Israel has a difficulty, it can either be a democracy or a Jewish state, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it can completely do both. \n\n2) The foreign policy choices of the United States are complicated and before the 1990\u2019s were largely driven by the Cold War. Since then there has been a rather formless foreign policy. You also misunderstand Israel\u2019s position in the region.

And this is what some of you used to be. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.\n\nTwo key Greek words in this passage are: malakoi and arsenkoitai.\n\nMatthew goes on to define malakoi as \u201ceffeminate.\u201d It\u2019s a Greek word that literally means \u201csoft\u201d and is used to describe fine clothing elsewhere in the New Testament. In a moral context, this word is actually more about \u201clack of self-control, weakness, laziness, or cowardice.\u201d My friend David, a pastor who got kicked out of his church for false accusations, told me over nachos recently that this word is actually about people who were \u201cspineless.\u201d Soft to the point that they wouldn\u2019t stand up for injustice or what truly matters. Irony of ironies, huh?\n\nThere were sexual connotations for \u201cmalakoi\u201d as well, but again, it always points backs to uncontrolled acts of lust or misused sexuality \u2014 no matter the gender or act. The word was not understood to reference same-sex behavior in the church until after the 20th century, when Bible translations adopted a new slant.\n\nArsenkoitai is more bizarre and hard to grasp. Many believe that St. Paul actually invented the word, as it is extremely rare in ancient Greek literature.\n\nThe word literally is a combination of two other words in Greek: arsen (male) and koites (bed). So, arsenkoitai could be translated literally as \u201cmale-bedders.\u201d And this word was understood by Bible translators before the 20th century to mean male-male sexual intercourse.\n\nBut when the word is used elsewhere in ancient Greek literature, it references the abuse of the poor (as in the Sibylline Oracles) or \u201ceconomic exploitation and power abuses (as in a 2nd century text called the Acts of John).\u201d The Acts of John lists arsenkoitai amongst a list of sins separate from a catalog of other sexual sins. Many believe (as Vines so cogently breaks down) that arsenkoitai is about economic abuses and exploitation.\n\nWhich is why the ancient act of \u201cpederasty\u201d is often brought up in relation to passages like this\u2014 the practice of Greek elite elder men who would adopt young men to use as sexual objects. Again, having nothing to do with LGBTQ loved ones, friends, and colleagues who are looking to live as good neighbors.\n\n&gt;Romans 1:26\u201327\nFor this reason God gave them up to degrading passions. Their women exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural, and in the same way also the men, giving up natural intercourse with women, were consumed with passion for one another. Men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons the due penalty for their error.\n\nSteve Chalke makes the argument that \u201cIdolatry, promiscuity and shrine prostitution are what Paul is addressing [here] in Romans 1 \u2014 not same-sex relationships between faithful and committed partners.\u201d\n\nSteve is right. This passage is clearly not about same-sex behavior carte blanche. It\u2019s about gross misuse of power, Roman elitist overindulgence, and misguided over-sexualized spirituality.\n\nIf you are looking to get really Biblical about this passage and all of these verses, go no further than James Brownson\u2019s tremendous Bible, Gender, Sexuality: Reframing the Church\u2019s Debate on Same-Sex Relationships.\n\nJim is a New Testament scholar in Michigan who takes the Bible incredibly seriously. He thinks this passage is about excessive lust: the central problem with lust in Romans 1 is that it is an expression of idolatry in a specific sense: lust involves serving one\u2019s own self-seeking desires rather than worshiping the one true God.\n\nBut more so than just excessive lust and how the early Christian communities should reject it, Brownson argues that this lust was being exhibited at a colossal scale by members of the Roman imperial court.\n\nEmperors Gaius and Caligula conjure up all sorts of sexual indulgence. Brownson says this, echoing the work of Neil Elliot:\n\nNeil Elliott has called attention to the striking similarities between Paul\u2019s language and the incredible greed, violence, and sexual excesses of Gaius Caligula, an emperor who reigned in a period not too long before Paul wrote Romans. First of all, Gaius is closely linked to the practice of idolatry. The Roman writer Suetonius reports how Gaius \u201cset up a special temple to his own godhead, with priests and with victims of the choicest kind.\u201d Another Roman writer, Dio Cassius, comments negatively on how Gaius was the only emperor to claim to be divine and to be the recipient of worship during his own lifetime. Gaius also tried at one point to erect a statue of himself in the Temple in Jerusalem; he was dissuaded only by a delegation from Herod Agrippa. Hence the link between Gaius and idolatry would have been well-known indeed, particularly in Jewish circles. But Gaius also serves as \u201cExhibit A\u201d for out-of-control lust. Suetonius reports how Gaius \u201clived in perpetual incest with all his sisters, and at a large banquet he placed each of them in turn below him, while his wife reclined above.\u201d He records gruesome examples of Gaius\u2019s arbitrary violence, vindictiveness, and cruelty. Later, Suetonius chronicles Gaius\u2019s sexual liaisons with the wives of dinner guests, raping them in an adjoining room and then returning to the banquet to comment on their performance. Various same-sex sexual encounters between Gaius and other men are similarly recounted. Finally, a military officer whom he had sexually humiliated joined a conspiracy to murder him, which they did less than four years into his reign. Suetonius records that Gaius was stabbed through the genitals when he was murdered. One wonders whether we can hear an echo of this gruesome story in Paul\u2019s comments in Romans 1: 27: \u201cMen committed shameless acts with men and received in their own person the due penalty for their error.\u201d Gaius Caligula graphically illustrates the reality of which Paul speaks in Romans 1: the movement from idolatry to insatiable lust to every form of depravity, and the violent murderous reprisal that such behavior engenders.\n\nso yeah it's even 'kinda true'", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "soccer", "date_year_month": "2018-12", "created_utc_converted": "2018-12-08 13:46:49", "score_overall": 4, "words": "cowardice greed jewish conspiracy", "shared_words": "cowardice greed jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

It's been easy to vilify bankers for a while now, you think that'd go away if it were only 'your' demographic?  That 'you're better than those jews, if only we controlled everything then bankers wouldn't be so greedy\".\n\nFucking hell.\n\n&gt;You have no physical evidence of the holocaust and you have no rational explanation of the over representation of jews in the mass media and high finance.\n\nYou do have physical evidence of the holocaust, and your focus on 'overrepresentation' is because you want an excuse to perpetrate it again.  I'd rather not go playing into your dreams of a 'better tomorrow' by showing you yet more pictures of dead bodies, because I'm quite certain you've seen enough for a lifetime.  You can play ignorant all you like, you know exactly what you're after.  The holocaust isn't a question to either of us.\n\n&gt;Hello, Chaim.

Prove it.\n\nAlso, these people currently have no voice in palestine. Hamas and PA block them. They torture, extort and murder them. And **you** are making this happen. The blame for the broken lgbt people is on you as much as it is on hamas.\n\n&gt;That isn't OK just because you are also an antisemite who is bigoted against the Haredi community.\n\nHow am I antisemitic for criticizing religion?

It won't work for palestinians because israel doesn't launch unguided rockets. Israel uses precise strikes on military objects.\n3)Hamas doesn't care about civillian lives.

They *tried* to make a white ethnostate by kicking out and/or killing all non-whites but didn't succeed. \n\nNazi Germany was an ethnostate, they actually mostly succeed at removing all minorities. Arabic nations are muslim ethnostates, most of them have ethnicly cleansed their countries of all jews and non-arabs/non-muslims.\n\nIsrael isn't an ethnostate because it has a minority of 2 million arabs.

Stop barking propaganda and start providing proof.\n\n&gt;It held up for the same reason it had held up for centuries.\n\nThat's very naive. Every jew knows it can all go down in a second.\n\n&gt;Jews have been living in Muslim countries at peace with their Muslim neighbours for centuries and centuries.\n\nThat's a lie and I have already proven otherwise in a discussion with you, though in another comment chain.

The Arab proportion of Jerusalem has gone up since 1967, and [half of Jerusalem's Arab population](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/half-of-jerusalems-palestinians-would-prefer-israeli-to-palestinian-citizen) would rather be ruled by the Jewish state than an Arab one.\n\nIt is Palestinian leaders who have called for a [Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/.premium-ahead-of-un-address-abbas-rejects-netanyahu-s-backing-of-palestinian-state-1.6512391), and also said that [no Israelis can live in a Palestinian state](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-israel-abbas/abbas-wants-not-a-single-israeli-in-future-palestinian-state-idUSBRE96T00920130730).\n\nPut the two together, and you have the Palestinian leader saying any area he takes over can't have Jews in it.\n\n&gt; if a government is to rule the area of not only Jerusalem, but also the greater Israel-Palestine area, it should be accommodating to both Jews and Muslims\n\nIrrelevant. We're talking about Jerusalem.\n\nBut while we're at it, let's consider the differences here:\n\n* Israel has over 20% of its population as Arab. They can vote, be in its Parliament, join its major political parties, and sit on its Supreme Court.\n\n* Palestine, the \"moderate\" half in the West Bank (not even talking about Gaza) says that if you [sell land to a Jew](https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/PA-Death-penalty-for-those-who-sell-land-to-Jews) you should be punished by death. Their Constitution says all [laws are based on Sharia (Islamic) law](https://www.palestinianbasiclaw.org/basic-law/2003-amended-basic-law) (Article 4, Section 2).\n\n* [60% of Israeli Arabs](https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Survey-60-percent-of-Arab-Israelis-have-positive-view-of-state-506150) have a positive view of the state, and [while noting discrimination (which occurs in every country in the world)](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/society/160937-171122-israeli-arabs-proud-to-be-israeli-but-report-widespread-incitement-poll), a majority are proud to be Israeli.\n\n* Palestine has 0 Jews, says no Israeli can live in their state, and their \"moderate\" leader has a PhD in [Holocaust denial](http://www.thetower.org/article/how-holocaust-denial-shaped-mahmoud-abbas-worldview/) (I mean really, a PhD was given to him for a Holocaust-denying thesis, from a Soviet university), he [blames Jews for their own genocide](https://www.timesofisrael.com/abbas-says-jews-behavior-not-anti-semitism-caused-the-holocaust/), he repeated a [medieval antisemitic myth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKmo-XJef3Y) about Jews to the European Parliament, and he claims Jews have [dirty feet that defile holy places](https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Abbas-Israelis-have-no-right-to-desecrate-our-holy-sites-with-their-filthy-feet-416307).\n\n* Israel allows free access to all holy sites, including Arab ones. It prevents Jews from praying on the Temple Mount, Jews' holiest site, because Arabs riot everytime Jews go up there.\n\n* The last Arab government to control the area was Jordan. It prevented Jews visiting any of their holy sites, including the Western Wall. [Palestinian preachers on the Temple Mount](https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Al-Aksa-blood-libel-preacher-who-said-Jews-masterminded-911-arrested-410982) insist Jews were behind 9/11, are evil, etc.\n\nWhich state is more accommodating to the other?\n\n&gt; Jews as a current inhabitant of those neighborhoods, and Arab Muslims as the historical inhabitants and majority up until just two generations ago\n\n[A generation is 25 years](https://isogg.org/wiki/How_long_is_a_generation%3F_Science_provides_an_answer), which means it was last majority-Arab in Jerusalem roughly 4 generations ago. That nitpick aside, the fact that people *used* to be a majority somewhere doesn't change that they *aren't*. Why should *today's* population be affected by the demographics of a hundred years ago?\n\nI'm sure you'd be singing a different tune if I said whites should continue to run the US because they have been the majority so long, even if they aren't the majority in 100 years. Because it would be dumb. That's the opposite of how democracy and human rights work.\n\n&gt; and yet the basis of Jewish families migrating to Jerusalem/Israel is based on a land claim several thousand years old.\n\nYep.\n\nIf you had asked me 100 years ago if Jews owned the land because they had a majority 2000 years ago, I'd have said no. **If they legally became a majority**, they could have a right to own the land. That's exactly what happened.\n\nWhy is this controversial? 100 years ago, 2000 years ago, neither changes **who lives there now**. That's what determines how we divide land, that and state sovereignty and international law.\n\nAll of them say West Jerusalem belongs to Israel. Why should the demographics of 100 years ago alter the situation of today?\n\n&gt; it may seem like an irrelevant argument, as the Jewish families have already migrated and i don't think anyone is proposing that we forcefully migrate them back (because that's obviously stupid and inhumane etc)\n\nMany, many Palestinians suggest precisely this. Hamas certainly does, and it controls 1/3 of the Palestinian population.\n\n&gt; but in order for these discussions to actually be fruitful and productive we need to acknowledge the totality of the historical context, not just the historical context as it exists from the years of 1948 to today\n\nThe \"historical context\" changes nothing about who controls it today, and international law.\n\nSo we can say yes, Arabs held a majority by keeping Jews out of their homeland of birth for decades (as did the Ottomans, Romans, etc.).\n\nThat doesn't change who controls it today. It doesn't change who has a right to control it today. It has been undisputed since 1948, and no one since before 1948 is still around to claim otherwise who owned it back then. An Arab-majority Jerusalem is barely within living memory, if at all, and it wasn't even Arab-Muslim back then (it hasn't been that in hundreds of years), and the current Palestinian state is explicitly Arab-Muslim. Palestinian Arabs don't have any claim to West Jerusalem. Even other Arab states acknowledge that.

The fact that the play entertains antisemitic ideas (and plays antisemitic tropes to entertain its audience) is inarguable. But, the question of whether it\u2019s an irredeemably antisemitic play is a different question. I\u2019m of the school that *Merchant* is actually a very pro-jewish play for its time, and maybe ours, too.

Everyone knows *Hamlet* because of Shakespeare, but *The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark* was only the best and most memorable of a number of older renditions of the tale. Likewise, *The Merchant of Venice* was a Shakespearean adaption of a similar play titled *The Jew of Malta* by the Bard\u2019s contemporary, Christopher Marlowe. Marlowe\u2019s tragedy features a shit ton of antisemitic canards: the titular Jew of Malta is completely bloodthirsty, a greedy merchant named Barabas who displays his exceptional greed, treachery, and manipulative and murderous nature throughout the show (during which he strangles a friar, betrays his allies, sells out his country, and\u2014surprise\u2014poisons dozens of people).\n\nSecondly: take into account the fact that most all jews had been expelled from England some 300 years before that play\u2019s writing, and it\u2019s safe to say it was written in a diversity vacuum.

What part confuses you?\n\nEdit: https://www.amazon.com/Bondage-Dead-Poland-Holocaust-History/dp/0815604033\n\nAbout one million Polish citizens were members of the German minority. Following the invasion of 1939, additional 1,180,000 German speakers came to occupied Poland either from the Reich or from the east with little to lose (the Volksdeutsche). Many hundreds of ethnically German men in Poland joined the Nazi Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz as well as Sonderdienst formations launched in May 1940 by Gauleiter Hans Frank stationed in occupied Krak\u00f3w.\n\nAs German authorities implemented killing on an industrial scale, they drew upon Polish police forces and railroad personnel for logistical support, notably to guard ghettos where hundreds of thousands of Jewish men, women, and children were held before deportation to killing centers. The so-called Blue Police was a force some 20,000 strong. These collaborators enforced German anti-Jewish policies such as restrictions on the use of public transportation and curfews, as well as the devastating and bloody liquidation of ghettos in occupied Poland from 1942-1943. Paradoxically, many Polish policemen who actively assisted the Germans in hunting Jews were also part of the underground resistance against the occupation in other arenas. Individual Poles also often helped in the identification, denunciation, and exposure of Jews in hiding, sometimes motivated by greed and the opportunities presented by blackmail and the plunder of Jewish-owned property.\n\nIn November 1940, an individual who signed his note Ewald Reiman blackmailed a family he believed was Jewish. \u201cLadies and Gentlemen,\u201d he wrote in a letter, \u201cOn the basis of accurate investigation, we have determined the truth about your Semitic origins. In view of the above, we request that you deliver to the bearer of this note the sum of 2,000 zlotys (two thousand zlotys) in a sealed envelope. \u2026 In return, we will destroy the incriminating evidence that is in our possession. Otherwise, we will immediately hand over the evidence to the German authorities.\u201d Such blackmailers made life miserable for Jews who had false identification documents enabling them to hide in plain sight and evade German orders to move into ghettos. \u201c[The plague of extortion] developed into a public evil endangering every Jew on the Aryan side,\u201d wrote the Warsaw Jewish historian Emanuel Ringelblum in 1944. \u201cThe extortionists stripped their victims of their every last possession and forced them to flee for their lives.\u201d\n\nCases of anti-Semitic action were not limited to abetting the German occupation authorities. There are well-documented incidents, particularly in the small towns of eastern Poland, where locals\u2014acutely aware of the Nazis\u2019 presence and emboldened by their anti-Semitic policies\u2014carried out violent riots and murdered their Jewish neighbors. Perhaps the most infamous of these episodes was a massacre in the town of Jedwabne in summer 1941 when several hundred Jews were burned alive by their neighbors. More difficult to unpack is the tangled history of the southeastern village of Gniewczyna \u0141a\u0144cucka. In May 1942, non-Jewish residents of the town held hostage some two to three dozen local Jews.

The prime minister of Israel is giving his blessing \u2013 once again \u2013 to the design of a nationalist narrative that makes a substantive alteration of the story of the Holocaust in general, and the story of the annihilation of Hungarian Jewry specifically.\n\nAgainst this background, it is worth trying to gain a better understanding of the motives driving the protagonists. Every few years there arises a new generation of similar leaders, local and global, who reflect and echo one another. Joseph Stalin and Adolph Hitler; Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt; Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Yitzhak Rabin; Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and Menachem Begin.\n\n&gt;&gt;Will Israel abet Hungary\u2019s whitewash museum? | Opinion \n\nIn our generation, these are the leaders of paranoia and phobia: Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Viktor Orban and Vladimir Putin. There is no conspiracy theory that is alien to them. As far as they are concerned, no external threat, imaginary or harebrained as it may be, does not grow to become a powerful bitter enemy, one that compels the emergency mobilization of forces needed to save the nation. And who, if not they, can be the savior from the demon they have just now created?\n\nIn the U.S., they talk about \u201cwhite supremacy,\u201d in Hungary about \u201cHungary for Hungarians\u201d and in Israel about \u201cthe Jewish state.\u201d It is a global phenomenon that crosses all boundaries, ethnic, racial or religious, gathering into a tribal ghetto that is smaller than the modern state, which is diverse and inclusive of all its citizens. Their fierce antagonism to the foundations of democracy, and the attempt to do detriment to as many accomplishments and benefits of the open society as possible are evidence of inherent weaknesses and real existential fears. Each of them is building a separation wall and is interested in isolating his people and his race from the rest of the world. The highest wall of all encompasses the new Jewish ghetto that has been established in the Land of Israel.\n\nNetanyahu, Erdogan, Trump and Orban have joined forces against a formidable and strong common enemy who is not at all afraid of them and who fights back using tools against which they are incapable of defending themselves. The unholy coalition of several Christian leaders and one Muslim leader, who are clearly tainted by anti-Semitism, together with a Jew, a prime minister of Israel who is steeped in auto-anti-Semitism, has taken a united stand against another Jew \u2013 George Soros \u2013 and declared all-out war on him.\n\nWhat is it about Soros that is so threatening to them? What is it that generates hope among so many people around the world who refuse to accept the yoke of this generation\u2019s leaders? What are they afraid of?\n\nThe state most familiar to us, the nation-state, is a relatively new conception, only a few centuries old. A sociopolitical consensus that succeeded in fostering a delicate equilibrium of rule and government that balances several constituent elements: territory, language, culture, heritage and at times also a shared religion.\n\nThe nation-state had a good run, up until two immense forces began the process of weathering and erosion of the state that had grown fatigued. From below it is being eaten away by sub-state forces and organizations. For example, the civil society and the division of the general corpus into sub-sections of discontented sub-identities (genders, skin colors, religious belongings, sexual preferences). And from above, globalization is gobbling up increasingly more authorities and powers that were once the sole province of the nation-state (tax shelters, worker mobility, shipping of goods and transfer of knowledge, migration and mobility of means of manufacture, among others).\n\nThe aforementioned heads of state feel hunted, and are digging in behind their lines of defense, reducing to a minimum the democratic and civil arenas. \u201cIlliberal democracy\u201d is how Netanyahu\u2019s anti-Semitic Hungarian friend described it. Anyone who is exactly like us is on our team, and anyone who is different is an adversary and an enemy.\n\nIn order to reinforce and isolate the Jewish ghetto in Israel, Netanyahu is prepared to concede everything, including the memory and the lessons of the Holocaust, and will join forces with present-day adherents of the racial doctrine. Words cannot describe the abject shame of it all: An Israeli prime minister associates himself with some of the worst Holocaust deniers of our generation in Poland, Hungary, Turkey and the U.S., and became the leader who places the international seal of approval on the global coalition of ghetto builders. At the cost of declaring open season on Soros the Jew \u2013 the \u201cJewboy\u201d as his opponents would label him \u2013 while engaging in total abandonment of the world of values and concepts of historic Judaism, its magnificent conception and its greatest sons and daughters.\n\nTrue, they have governments and power, armies and efficient mechanisms for the spread of darkness. But nothing can stop the world that has no borders. In part because the coalition standing before them is a coalition of openness, of which Soros is the primary global mainstay. His vision, of an open and equal society and state, is threatening to the conservatives seeking to maintain their freedom to be different, privileged and the keepers of all manner of discrimination. Each of them may possess a solution to his own problems \u2013 maybe \u2013 but has an utter lack of interest in the fate of the rest of humanity. They are like the man in the boat in the Jewish parable, who is drilling a hole in the floor beneath him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d shout his friends. \u201cWhat concern is it of yours?\u201d he counters. \u201cAm I not drilling under my own spot?\u201d\n\nThe partners in the coalition of walls and phobias \u2013 Jews and Jew-haters who have joined forces \u2013 are drilling so many holes in the floor of the human ship that they are threatening to sink it. Soros, conversely, is attempting to plug holes and save the human commonality for the benefit of us all.\n\nHe has girded his loins for a war, and has become the greatest of all global builders of the dream of an open human society. He is a worthy and powerful opponent to all of the aforementioned bullies of nationalism. No longer fragments of organizations and abstract utopian ideas, but a courageous individual harboring concrete ideas for a more enlightened world, with capabilities, commitment and resoluteness.\n\nAnd the battle is being waged. At this juncture, they are the attackers and he the attacked. But at some point in the near future, freedom, as it always does, will win out.

You want to talk about antisemitism and how it's a fact of history that Jews have been hated for over 3000 years by cultures and societies that have come and gone, but at the same time distance yourself practically speaking from that Judaism that has persisted and exists as it always has for so long against the odds and cultures that saught to destroy us? ...What is that, if not hypocrisy? It's certainly not aligned with the definition of Judaism.\n\n\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s something I jotted down last year, when the tiki-torch-toting white supremacists showed themselves in Charlottesville:\n\n&gt;&gt; *Escalation of civil war seems almost inevitable right now, so I am having these fucked up thoughts like, \u201cTo be safe, do I need to hide that Tzivia and I are Jewish (change her name)? Will we need to take our BLM sticker off our car?\u201d Western Washington is safe though, would be far from the frontlines. I think when I daydream about Cascadia, it\u2019s because I just want to believe I\u2019m safe; want to believe that, now that I\u2019m in the PNW, the South can\u2019t get me.*\n\n&gt; ...The day before the Tree of Life synagogue shooting, I saw a conversation in a yoga Facebook group where someone called someone else out on being anti-Semitic. The offender said it wasn\u2019t anti-Semitic, and a white ally commented that people of color could say for themselves what was/wasn\u2019t racist. The offender replied that, Whatever, Jewish people aren\u2019t people of color. It\u2019s just a religion.\n\n&gt; Am I a person of color?\n\n&gt; My brother and I were the only Jewish kids in our elementary school. From the time I was aware of race, it was made clear to me by others that I was Other. That there was a White Default and I was not it.\n\n\n\n\nIn parallel with Judaism being defined by our values, we need to stand against the injustices that all and any face. This however is of course hard to do when we're oft the targets ourselves, and oft by those same people who we would otherwise stand up for. \n\n(I was going to write a piece here about my beliefs surrounding the second amendment in America and the duty Jews have from a Judaic moral standpoint to utilize it to defend themselves and their communities (and along side others as opposed to against others) rather than live in fear by battening down the hatches, but feel that would get me more downvotes than I already deserve; so I won't.)\n\nEven still, Jews are idealists and optimists by nature. This is a good thing, a wonderful thing, but not when that is applied to our identities as a basis for \"enlightenment\" of our culture in futile attempts to fit in and not be seen as \"the others\". We don't stand for the downtrodden by lowering ourselves to them, by trying to fit in. We stand to be able to raise them up. Compromising who and what we are isn't how we do this. We be all we can be, to help them be all they can be. \n\n&gt; ...while everyone else sang their hearts out with the Christian privilege they didn\u2019t even know they had.\n\nThis struck a cord with me. Maybe I'm trying to convince myself, but I feel like this statement alone explains how and why we're \"the other\", as well as why that's ok and not a bad thing.\n\n&gt; I don\u2019t talk or write about any of this much, because I know I have so much privilege. I know that other minorities have it so much worse. While I understand that privilege and racism aren\u2019t all-or-nothing, I sometimes feel shame when I talk about myself as a victim, because while Jews deal with plenty of micro-aggressions and conspiracy theory-based anger, we are free of some of the worst systemic racism that affects other people of color.\n\n&gt; Sometimes it\u2019s hard to be an ally when you\u2019re fearing for your own safety, but I\u2019m committed to keep doing it. We\u2019re in this together.\n\nOk... I'll say it here even though I said I wouldn't. \n\n\n\n**\"If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?**--Pirkei Avot\n\n\n\nI've been advocating for Jews as a community to take responsibility for their own and community safety for a long time as I don't think we can reasonably rely on anyone else to do that job, but many Jews don't feel the same way and expect the government and society to be able to or obligated to protect... history says otherwise, and as you said and history concurs, we're the \u201cOther\u201d. \n\n**\"If I am not for myself, who will be for me?\"**\n\n\nIn America we're blessed with two inalienable freedoms, religion and the right to protect that with arms. If only we had that right and ability during and before the holocaust, how would it have been different? How many more Others or \u201cundesirables\u201d, as the Nazis called anyone not of Ayrian persuasion, would have been saved had Jews been all we could be, had we been proud of what we are, and had we done all we could do; had we fought?\n\n**\"And if I am only for myself, what am I?\"**\n\n\nKristallnacht is often cited as the night the holocaust began. While there were previous warning signs before, it always formally starts with the Jews. What kind of statement would it have made if the Jews defended themselves then, and how would it have impacted the rest of the war? What if we recognized the warning signs even before, had we recognized the injustices that happened against others, and fought as Jews? Not only would we have saved ourselves, but we would have saved others\u2026 \n\n\n\n**\"And if not now, when?\"**\n\n\n\nRav Hillel's words convey more than a feel-good message, and are more than just a call to arms and action. It is a warning. The answer is *now and always!* And while I often carry my firearm, a tool for the times we live--the **now**, concealed. I **always** carry my Jewishness openly all because I am not only for myself, but *Others* as well, and it is this that has allowed for Judaism to not only survive, but thrive!\n\nIt is not our right, it is our obligation!\n\n\n\n(Edit: words and formatting)\n\n\n\n\n\n", "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Judaism", "date_year_month": "2018-12", "created_utc_converted": "2018-12-21 04:06:46", "score_overall": 21, "words": "jewish jewish jew jewish jew jew jew jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish conspiracy holocaust holocaust", "shared_words": "jewish jew conspiracy holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}

Claimed he \"didn't know\" that the guy was a Holocaust denier at the time. The group was riddled with Holocaust deniers, he was part of it for 10 years, and Corbyn went to an event in 2013 despite the head of the group making clear his Holocaust denial since 2005.\n\n* Stephen Sizer was a vicar who linked to an antisemitic and Holocaust denial website. Corbyn said that those criticizing him were taking advantage of a \"technical oversight\" because they didn't like Sizer's politics. Sizer proceeded in the next few years to attend 9/11 truther conferences in Iran blaming 9/11 on Israel, and espousing further Holocaust denial.\n\n* Raed Salah is head of a banned movement in Israel. He claimed Jews steal Christian children's blood for matzoh in 2007 (an old antisemitic myth). He was convicted of inciting violence and racism for that speech in Israel. He blamed 9/11 on Jews in October 2011. In April 2012, a British court found that he had used the antisemitic blood libel, but that it wasn't enough for criminal charges. They also found that he had encouraged violence. In June 2012, Corbyn invited Salah to Parliament, invited him to \"tea on the terrace\", and called him an \"honored citizen\".\n\n* Corbyn, his office staff, and some MPs were found to be members of a private Facebook group where many antisemitic posts were made. He claimed he had no knowledge of what was said in the group. He left after becoming leader of Labour. He made a few posts in the group during the &amp;lt;1 year he was in it. He was also part of 2 other groups that also contained antisemitic posts, though they were less common. He claimed he had no idea he was added either.\n\n* In 2012, a painter put up a street mural that depicted antisemitic themes involving a Rothschild, Rockefeller, etc. cabal running the world. The painter denied it was antisemitic because he included whites, not just Jews, running the world. The mural was deemed antisemitic and slated for destruction. Corbyn said it should be left up and then he claimed afterwards that he \"didn't realize\" it was accused of being antisemitic.\n\n* He attended a Passover celebration with a radical Jewish group called \"Jewdas\", which claims that any attempt to accuse Corbyn of antisemitism is just a political ploy and claims Israel should be destroyed.\n\n* A Palestinian Authority spokesperson at an event in 2013 made some vaguely antisemitic statements about Jews wanting to build a messianic vision of Israel and how they think they're the only children of God. Some pro-Israel activists then got up and argued with him at the event. A few days later, Corbyn claimed that those \"Zionists\" don't \"want to study history, and secondly, having lived in this country for a very long time, probably all their lives, they don't understand English irony either\". Many pointed out that accusing Jews of not understanding English culture despite living there all their lives is the type of antisemitic canard Jews have heard for centuries, including prominent Holocaust scholars. He claims it was all out of context and he only has a problem with \"Zionists\", not all Jews. More than 90% of Jews worldwide are Zionists. Other speakers at the conference where he made this comment included Sizer (the 9/11 truther I mentioned before). The conference was promoted by the military wing of Hamas.\n\n* He held an event where a controversial Holocaust denier compared Israel to the Nazis on Holocaust Memorial Day, in Parliament in 2010.\n\n* He received up to $27,000 to appear on Iran's state TV in the past, which obviously hosts a ton of antisemitism. He refused to say if he regrets going on it. He claims BBC has a \"bias\" towards saying Israel \"has a right to exist\", and that it's all because Israel is pressuring the BBC. Sounds a lot like \"Jews are influencing our media\" to many listeners.\n\n* Also on Iranian TV, he implied Israel was responsible for an jihadist attack on an Egyptian army base in 2012 because \"in whose interests\" other than Israel's would it be to cause the violence, he claimed. This is a conspiracy theory with no merit. He proceeded to say, \"I suspect the hand of Israel in this whole process of destabilization\".\n\n* In the midst of the latest flareup revealing a lot of this information, which has dripped out over the past three years, he wrote an op-ed for *The Guardian* about how he opposed antisemitism. He asked two leading Jewish groups if it would be disrespectful to release it on the evening of the Sabbath, when religiously observant Jews would be unable to read/respond to it until over a day later. They told him it would be an act of \"tremendous bad faith\". He ignored them and published it at 5:30 on Friday anyways, right around when Sabbath starts.\n\nI haven't even spoken about the debate over antisemitism, or about the institutional antisemitism that has flourished in the party under his leadership. I've only spoken to the people he directly associates with, and what he's said/done. This is the tip of the iceberg.\n\nAs Bret Stephens put it (and Stephens has plenty of issues of his own), [the excuses Corbyn gives](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/opinion/jeremy-corbyn-anti-semite.html) are that somehow he just manages to stumble into every antisemitic controversy and meet every antisemite, but it's never intentional. It stretches the imagination.\n\nDownvote away, antisemites. The fact that everyone is responding to Corbyn\u2019s defense of Holocaust deniers and people echoing the medieval blood libel about Jews with \u201cBUT ISRAEL\u201d is only proving my point. Praising blood libelers is not criticizing Israel. You can criticize Israel without being antisemitic.

Always appreciate what you put into this sub\n\nThank you.\n\n&gt; Well Haim Saban owns lots of media and he's said before he's a single issue voter and that issue is Israel. Considering he's a top dem donor I'd say the democrat party makes sure this is the case, as many democrats support anti-speech measures concerning BDS and Israel. \n\nIs he doing a terrific job of it? It seems to me that he is losing the Democratic Party. From Keith Ellison being the vice-chair of the DNC, to the increased stridency of their anti-Israel nonsense. He's pretty dumb to support the Democrats, if his concern truly is Israel. And I can't see many mainstream media outlets that he owns, mostly entertainment, not?\n\n&gt; And even the media types critical of Israel would never question their right to exist and the need for a Jewish homeland. Remember even mainstream left sources backed Iraq along with most (all) Jewish congressmen of both parties. The leftist Jews who are ostensibly anti Israel will still go on birthright.\n\nIronically, Ariel Sharon warned Bush against going into Iraq. Not sure how the myth of 'war for Israel' spread. And I'm pretty sure that Bernie Sanders is a Jew - he opposed the war. \n\n&gt; Hollywood as an industry was founded and built by Jewish immigrants. It's one of the crowning achievements of American Jews. If there's any industry there can be no doubt about Jewish domination, it's film. It's interesting you bring up the idea of white male domination. First off, would it be disproportionate to their population, and second would Jews be thrown in the white category? I think it was WaPo that showed how various industries are dominated by whites, not realizing that of the 19/20 whites named as leaders of hollywood, 15 were Jewish.\n\nI take issue with the whole thing of 'ethnic domination'. White men make up, what is it, 30% of the population? Yet they 'control' or 'dominate' certain positions in a way that is disproportionate to the 30% of the population. I would argue that this doesn't matter, as they do not act with group interests in mind. That applies to white men and the Jews in Hollywood. There are many criticisms to be made of Hollywood, but \"supporting Jewish group interests\" is not one of them.\n\n&gt; I'd bet it is. There's a rumor that he was a holocaust revisionist too, drunkenly revealed at a dinner party.\n\nI doubt it, he was very strongly anti-anti-Semitic. When he was at a restaurant where he had been told that Jews were not welcome, he asked if he could be served kosher. But of course, he wouldn't stand for nonsense coming from anyone.\n\n&gt; The point about Clopper wasn't over the merits of circumcision, it was the consequences of even speaking about it and making the Jewish connection considering the ritual first appeared with Judaism.\n\nActually, the Jews got it from the Egyptians. Really something to be proud of. \n\n&gt; If you want more evidence of the academic stranglehold that suppresses open discourse I would suggest looking into Norman Finkelstein. He wrote his thesis debunking some ludicrous book claiming Palestinian Arabs aren't native to Palestine and he's been dogged with slander and blacklisting ever since. Though I will note that it was Noam Chomsky who championed Finkelsteins critique and notified British literary reviewers of the inaccurate aspects of the book\n\nI am familiar with Norman Finkelstein. He's a bit of a nutter, going even further than a lot of anti-Israel Jews. However, I don't agree with shaming him because he is a Jew who happens to have that position. \n\nBut we need to decide if this is about Israel or not. Earlier, you said that being anti-Israel is not necessarily anti-Semitism. I agree. However, if Jewish influence is felt because of Finkelstein being attacked for criticizing a bit of an out there book, how is it that these Jews do nothing about mainstream media defending Hamas assaulting Israel's border, or labeling Ivanka Trump \"daddy's little ghoul\"? Or the other double standards that are held against Israel? \n\nJournalists may or may not be Jews. That seems to be a non-factor, since nothing they write is based on that. It's all based on them uniformly being SJWs.\n\n&gt; Just being allowed to make basic observations without having your life ruined or blackmailed into submission would be a great start. If we talk about the intersection of industry and social justice it's worth mentioning a common denominator.\n\nI really see no point to it. It's the truth, so no one should have his life ruined over it. I would also say that no one should have his life ruined for saying \"Jews are evil because many Jews are SJWs\". But that *would* be a wrong thing to say, and I see no productive avenue beyond this observation. \n\nIt's also counterproductive politically. Whether you like it or not, trying to make it about \"Jews\" will make you appear to be biased against Jews, and it will overshadow your point against SJWs, hurting the good fight. It also will alienate Jewish allies, who I think are ripe for the picking given SJWs' hatred for Israel which is now extending to Jews.", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "date_year_month": "2018-12", "created_utc_converted": "2018-12-21 16:34:06", "score_overall": 13, "words": "jewish jewish jew jewish jewish jewish jewish holocaust kosher jewish jew jewish jewish", "shared_words": "jewish jew holocaust kosher", "socre_distint": 4}

Is that the right word?\n\n&gt;Religions generally start when one teacher spreads his teachings to many disciples. The people who accept these teachings are considered coreligionists. Their common beliefs hold them together as a community.\n\n&gt;The Jewish people, then, are best described as the \u201cPeople of the Covenant\u201d\u2014meaning that they are a people because of a covenant. What is special about this covenant is that it is not a covenant between two individuals, or even between an individual and G\u2011d (as Abraham had made), but a covenant between an entire nation and G\u2011d.\n\n&gt;The covenant, as I wrote, is what defines us as a nation\u2014not geographic vicinity, language, government or culture. Even if we live in different countries, speak different languages, establish different leaders and eat different foods, that covenant still bonds us.\n\n&gt;Most significantly: even if we stop keeping our obligations under that covenant or decide not to believe in it, the covenant endures. A covenant, you see, is a two-way deal. It takes two to make it and two to break it. Just because the people have let go, doesn\u2019t mean G\u2011d has. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called an \u201ceternal covenant\u201d\u2014because even if the people may be fickle, G\u2011d doesn\u2019t change His mind.\n\n&gt;So there\u2019s the difference: In a religion, you belong because you believe.

I just blocked after a while of getting nowhere.\n\nBased on his thing about the media (which, I checked, many people on that graphic aren\u2019t practicing Jews) he seems to have a hatred of the rich elite that he wrongly generalised towards an entire race of people.

That doesn\u2019t mean that Jews are inferior to others (hell, somebody on the other side could use that fact\u2014stupidly, but more logically\u2014to say that Jews are superior), it doesn\u2019t mean that if Aryans were in their place they would be any more sympathetic towards the common man, and it doesn\u2019t mean that every Jew is part of some vast global conspiracy to eradicate Aryans and suppress anti-Zionist information (indeed, many Jews **are** anti-Zionist, including myself\u2014a supporter of Palestinian freedom). The rich having too much control is a problem, whether some happen to be Jews is irrelevant to me.\n\nThe ideology is disgusting, however. It does not follow that because some Jews hold power, a fascist dictatorship is the best form of government. Especially when dictatorships, like those in Germany and Italy, are known to crush the poor, to gas dissenters, and to be jingoistic and violent towards states that did not attack them. Not to mention the worst genocide in human history, the Holocaust, which still leaves scars to this day. \n\nThis fucker neads to read Elie Wiesel\u2019s ***Night*** before trying to dismiss Nazi crimes against humanity.

Most of the time, they have zero life achievements and instead choose to take pride in the colour of their skin or their ancestry, something that they couldn\u2019t choose and something that is totally superficial. They have a very simple view of the world: Jews control everything, every Jew is an enemy, I am a defender of Western civilisation (even though I stand against the principles our civilisation was founded upon). People like Nathan Domingo (the founder of Identity Evropa, a Neo Nazi pro Segregation group) became Nazis because they were without direction in life and needed community, in addition Domingo was completely ripped apart mentally by the Iraq War. Their views, while overly simplistic and idiotic, have deadly consequences. Once one dehumanises the Jewish people, the inevitable result is what happened in Charlottesville (where an Ohioan, James Fields, drove his car into a crowd of anti fascists and killed Heather Heyer) or Pittsburgh (where a Nazi killed 11 people, some of whom were old enough to have lived through the Holocaust, who were at a temple). \n\nTL; DR: Fascists misdirect their hatred of the ruling class towards an entire race of people, are lazy thinkers, and the ideology is just sad.

Or rich oligarchs and dictators elsewhere in the world, most of whom are indigenous?\n\nPower and opportunity (especially nepotistic opportunity) are better explanations.  It's how power has always maintained power: by bestowing a taste of power on those who are the keys to maintaining that power.

The key is intent and by whom.\n\nAlso, [Mercantilism](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mercantilism.asp) is not what you seem to think it is; it's a flawed theory of trade that posits that the amount of wealth in the world is fixed.  It has long since been abandoned.  In fact, mercantilism and modern international trade are predicated on mutually exclusive presuppositions.\n\n&gt; Clearly European society got it severely wrong in thinking their property rights were inclusive of Africans\n\nSure, by contemporary moral standards, it sure did.  But, again, Europeans were not the only slavers and conquerors who would acquire resources by force.  They were just spectacularly more successful at it because of the technological advantages which arose from the Enlightenment.\n\n&gt; (gold, rubber, bauxite, copper aluminium &amp; everything the west takes for granted in the form of most technological products) then conveniently abolishing slavery once all wealth had been maximised\n\nOn the contrary, countries with such natural resources do very, very well.  Just look to the oil producers of the Middle East.  Ever heard of tantalum?  It's an element used in a certain type of electronic capacitor [that has acquired the status of a conflict mineral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantalum#Status_as_a_conflict_resource) in the Congo. Some of my colleagues won't design circuits that use tantalum capacitors for that reason.\n\nAlmost by definition, these resources can't be found in sufficient quantities the developed world.  In a backhanded way, by having established dependence on them in those dark days, we've handed those countries a key to exploiting the developed West.  Unfortunately, corruption and greed work the same in developing countries, and most ordinary people never get to benefit from the riches of their natural resources.\n\n&gt; after it accumulated most of its asset/ property from slavery and global oppression\n\nNonsense.  Almost all land acquired under imperial exploits has been returned and, other than mined resources, the product of those lands (eg cotton, coffee and tea) are no longer the property of western powers.\n\nInstitutions such as the OECD, WTO and EU go out of their way to grant one-way exceptions in favour of developing economies to allow them to exploit their resources without being out-competed by more developed economies.\n\n&gt; setting up its structure for the newer Globalisation system\n\nAgain, nonsense; globalisation is a pretty recent phenomenon that started in the mid 20th C. and didn't really take off until the '80s.  Prior to that, protectionist trade policy was the rule, and even the EU is stiffly protectionist, especially on agrigoods.\n\n&gt; enabling it to be the largest empire in history reaching its peak between 1890 - 1922\n\nThat's pretty specific.  Who controlled this empire, and who benefited from it?  Was it exclusive imperial power and, if not, why single it out?\n\n&gt; a mere 53 years after it abolished slavery.\n\nEmpire had been around since the days of Henri VIII, and especially after Harrison (a Yorkshire carpenter!) invented his marine chronometer, and that's just Western empires.\n\nImperial exploits have been around a lot longer than that.  The Ottomans date from the early 14th C. and the Silk Road dates from 2nd C. BCE or before.\n\n&gt; But we\u2019re not talking about the Arab world.\n\nWhy not?  What exempts Jewish and Arab slavers from moral condemnation?\n\n&gt; It\u2019s not anti Semitic to state a fact is it?\n\nOf course it's not.  It doesn't attribute being slavers with anything intrinsically semitic.  That sense of antisemitism is exploitative political opportunism.\n\n&gt; Just like virtually every European country has at one time or another persecuted Jewish people.\n\nSo why single out the West for special moral scrutiny when all have engaged in exploitative practices?  The West just turned out to be better at it, and only because of its technology.  Maori history when the British first showed up demonstrates that any group will settle old scores, given a technological edge and the opportunity (c.f. the demise of the Moriori).\n\n&gt; But no country or people did it with the level of genius and sadism as done under the capitalist system during the transatlantic slave trade and the industrial revolution era of European western society.\n\nThat's revisionist.  A lot of conquering powers were far more sadistic than Europeans ever were (c.f. Japanese treatment of PoWs).  The only reason nobody cares is because they lost out to European technology.\n\n&gt; transatlantic slavery was a major contributor to to today\u2019s western wealth\n\nContributor, yes, but we've had several rather recent and profound demonstrations of how wealth can be destroyed.  What wealth was plundered from elsewhere has long since diffused and faded.\n\n&gt; we as a Globalist society believe in ownership of Asset/ Property\n\nA lot of ordinary western citizens are none too fond of globalism precisely because globalism has benefited the poorest 50% and the richest 1% far out of proportion to the percentiles in between (which represent western working and middle classes).\n\n&gt; social cowardice prevents many privileged people\n\nBy global standards you, too, are *wildly* privileged.  You have access to technology and education most of the world can barely but dream of.\n\n&gt; Globalisation was born out of Capitalism\n\nYes, although it's far from certain that something a bit like globalisation would not have developed anyway, depending on what prevailed instead of capitalism.\n\n&gt; [capitalism] was born from a rotten core.\n\nBold claim.  Care to elaborate?\n\n&gt; That rotten core was Mercantilism.\n\nCapitalism, globalism and mercantilism are three quite different things even if they are tangentially related to one another.\n\nActually, I'd say that the problem goes far deeper than capitalism or globalism alone (mercantilism is a thing of the past): it has to do with the role of commercial banks in creating money supply by way of lending.\n\nIn brief: a person who takes out a mortgage issues a promissory note, no different in principle to a gilt, cheque or bank note other than that it's \"non-negotiable\", which the bank buys by crediting the borrower's *electronic* account with *electronic* money.  This money is transferred, electronically, to the seller's account who usually uses it to buy another house (perhaps with a top-up mortgage) and around it goes.  (It was no different when accounts were kept in paper ledgers, either, it's just a lot easier than ever before with electronic ledgers.)\n\nHence, the act of writing a mortgage literally creates money.  It's a trick of accounting that involves setting up a mutual liability to one another which, superficially, creates zero net change.  The \"capital\" deposited in the borrower's account is a fiction netted against time.  It was never real: at the moment the new money was credited to the borrower's account, more or less the equivalent of a set of post-dated balancing entries are entered to show zero net change in money at the maturity of the mortgage (assuming it isn't defaulted on, which is the Achilles' heel in the idea).\n\nBut that maturity is a long, long way away; meanwhile, the books don't really balance because anybody will accept that as real money (notably the seller's bank) because everyone agrees it is real money and can be used as such.\n\nAbout 97% of money in circulation is created this way.  If this sounds fanciful, read the [BoE's article describing the process](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy), although they aren't quite as explicit as the description I just gave.  This is not even any secret, people do talk about it but, for reasons that you can imagine, it's not a popular topic of conversation.\n\nEveryone knows that printing money, which is exactly what this is, generates inflation.  And to the extent that new money is created faster than value is created, that's precisely what happens.  The problem is that while trade output can grow, fixed-quantity assets (like houses) don't, so you see way higher inflation in asset prices than you do in the productive economy.\n\nThis isn't even capitalism, it's modern banking which is capitalist in theory, but not in practice.\n", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "date_year_month": "2018-12", "created_utc_converted": "2018-12-24 14:54:29", "score_overall": 5, "words": "greed jewish jewish globalist cowardice", "shared_words": "greed jewish globalist cowardice", "socre_distint": 4}
{"archived": false, "author": "TanookiDooki", "body": "**\"Chosen\" doesn't mean what people think it means.**\n\nJudaism establishes a series of laws known as the noahide laws. These laws are a standard of rule, law, and ethics that the whole of humanity is held to. \n\nJews are \"chosen\" in the sense we have been given a higher standard of responsibility to uphold. You'll typically hear that Jews have 613 commandments we follow. A non-Jew isn't required to observe laws a Jew is required to follow.\n\n- We can't eat pork\n- We can't eat unclean food\n- We can't break Shabbat\n- We can't do many of the things a non-Jew is allowed to do\n\nThat being said, you're not having our rules held against you if you break them. Only Jews are. \n\nSo that alone doesn't make sense from the perspective of \"Choosiness\" being something Jews use to look down on others. If we thought less of other people, we'd argue that God judges you more harshly than he does us, the opposite is true. \n\nWe actually have a tradition which states humanity as a whole was offered the Torah but only the Jews accepted. While it isn't explicitly stated in the Torah, it is part of the supplementary works which make up the full body of Jewish commentary.\n\n- The reason the Torah was given in the desert and not in the promised land was the desert belonged to no one. It was a place no one had claim to so everyone was welcome to accept the covenant regardless of nation status. \n\n- When the words were spoken, they were heard in every language. The revelation at Sinai wasn't in the tongue the Israelites spoke, it was in the tongue of every nation so that any ear that heard it could accept the gift. It wasn't an isolated covenant. \n\n- Genesis states that when God created mankind, he did so in his own image. That isn't specific to Jews, that's specific to the whole of humanity. Why would God put such an essence into beings that he didn't consider worthy of such a gift? Our tradition says that we are ALL images of God. Some are Jewish and some aren't but we're all children of the same creator.\n\n- The Jewish people convert. We still have people to this day who convert into the nation long after Sinai had occurred. The very fact that we allow converts in the first place is evidence that we don't look down on non-Jews. If we did, why would we ever consider someone we consider lower than us to be worthy of the covenant? Because we don't think people are lower than us, they have a different set of responsibilities from our tradition, that's it. \n\n&gt;It seems to be that this attribute of jewish doctrine conceptually underpins Zionism by validating the perspective that these chosen peoples homeland is more needed then the homeland of others.\n\nThe reason why the Jewish people need a homeland is the world validated that they couldn't be trusted to protect us. \n\nThe Jewish people didn't enter the outside world willingly. We had our country invaded and we were forced into exile by the Babylonians and Romans.  \n\n**I'm going to list off a series of countries.** All of these countries have persecuted or exiled the Jewish people at some point in history.\n\n- England\n- Spain\n- Portugal\n- Italy\n- Germany\n- France\n- Russia\n- Ukraine\n- Finland\n- Poland\n- Hungary\n- Belgium\n- Netherlands\n- The list goes on.\n\nIf you asked any one of these countries why they went after us, you'd get a thousand different answers. \n\n- The Nazis argued we were aligned with the Communists\n\n- The Soviets argued we were aligned with the Capitalists\n\n- The Protestants and the Catholics argued we killed Jesus and were aligned with the devil. [(The Protestant leader, Martin Luther, actually wrote a document called \"On The Jews and Their Lies\")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies) which outlined specifically how the Jews should be subjugated.\n\n- [The Catholic church kidnapped our children during the Holocaust and forcibly converted them to Catholicism while they were being kept \"safe\" in Catholic institutions.](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/09/world/saving-jewish-children-but-at-what-cost.html) They saved their lives but killed their identities. \n\n- The Far-Right argues we're aligned with Muslims because we're semites and not really white people.\n\n- The Far-Left argues we're Europeans masquerading and middle eastern people and responsible for the crimes of the 1%.\n\n- [Europe argued we were responsible for the black plague because fewer of us died.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death_Jewish_persecutions) The reason fewer of us died was because we lived in ghettos (separate from them), we ate different food (kosher), and Jewish tradition requires we bury the dead immediately. Not leave them out to contaminate. \n\n- And everybody rolls their eyes at the mention of the Holocaust because \"That was like 70 years ago, get over it.\"\n\n**If everyone had a singular reason for hating the Jewish people, just one unified reason, you could argue that our persecution had a cause. No one can agree on why they hated us but they all simply agreed on the hate. Not the cause for the hate.**\n\nThat is evidence of insanity on their part, not mistakes on our part. \n\n\nWhy does Israel need to exist and why did Zionism come into existence? Zionism is a side-effect of a Jew-hating world. The only reason Jews go back to Israel is they fear for their lives everywhere else. Even in Israel, surrounded by states that want our destruction, we live with the peace of mind that we are handling ourselves from now on. \n\nEurope was given thousands of chances to protect us and they failed each and every time. Even today 40,000 Jews have fled France. \n\nThere would be no modern Zionism if the world didn't actively prove a need for modern Zionism.

{"archived": false, "author": "beaverteeth92", "body": "&gt;  these nitwits are gonna have to decide whether white jews are part of the white supremacy or marginalized people\n\nThis is the main issue I have with young leftists.  I'm Jewish, was raised Jewish, and went to day school for 11 years.  I haven't practiced in years but still generally support Israel as a Jewish state, even though I despise Netanyahu and think that Likud is currently the biggest thread to Israel's existence.  Why do I support them despite Netanyahu being a heinous person?  Because sooner or later, even after centuries of relative safety, a country *will* turn on its Jews.  It's only going to get worse in the next few decades at the last remaining Holocaust survivors - the people who understand the evils of anti-Semitism the most - die out.  Thousands of Jews have been fleeing France as anti-Semitic attacks have increased in frequency.  Their destination is Israel because it's the only government in the world that is guaranteed to protect Jews no matter what happens.  In the 60s and 70s, thousands of Jews fled Arab countries and Ethiopia to establish a better life in Israel.  Sure, if Israel didn't exist, they might have successfully immigrated somewhere else.  But would another country have sent a 747 to Ethopia to smuggle out as many Jews as possible?  I sincerely doubt it.  They fled to Israel because Israel is the only on earth that will unconditionally protect Jews.\n\nA lot of leftists don't understand just how much the need to be defensive is bashed into the heads of every Jew since childhood.  Sure, I never go to shul, but do you think Hitler would have cared about that?  If you had as much as a Jewish grandparent the Nazis considered you Jewish.  So of *course* we're going to support the existence of an explicitly Jewish state.  After virtually every country rejected refugee Jews during World War II, resulting in the ship going back to Europe and their deaths, why should we trust that anyone other than an explicitly Jewish state will protect us?\n\nAnd yet, we're the only people on earth whom a sizable number of leftists think do not have the right to self-determination.  There are plenty of countries founded on barbarism and because of colonialism, and many who have done heinous things, but no one questions said countries' right to exist.  In the 80s, there were lots of protests around apartheid in South Africa, but no one was claiming that South Africa shouldn't exist because of it.  There are no conversations about how Burma shouldn't exist because of its genocide of the Rohingya, no discussions about Belgium being broken up because of King Leopold's treatment of the Congolese, but it's pretty common to talk about Israel not being allowed to exist.  And yet the same people would probably not complain if land from Kurdistan was taken from sovereign nations to give the Kurds their own state.\n\nIt's disappointing how few leftists even try to understand the Jewish need to feel security.  I'd hope Tamika Mallory, who's black and has presumably had the \"you have to be defensive when it comes to interactions with the police\" discussion, would understand why Jews are similarly defensive.  But nope.  She goes to watch Farrakhan talk, even though he's just as anti-Semitic in 2018 as he was fifty years ago.  I suspect that if a Jewish leader of the women's march went to see a Hassidic rabbi who gave a speech on black people being descendants of Ham who are inherently evil, Tamika Mallory would call for her head.  Similarly, if I lectured a black person how they're required to feel about police shootings and being followed by security in a department store, I'd be rightfully attacked for it.  Meanwhile, if I say that I support Israel's right to exist and that anti-Semitism is a real problem (*especially* if it's about anti-Semitism in leftist spaces; e.g. Corbyn-bots), a bunch of obnoxious, useless goyim will gang up on me and tell me exactly how I should feel and lecture me in an equally condescending way.\n\nI think a lot of it is that Jews are a difficult minority to understand from a social justice standpoint.  If you believe racism is \"power + privilege\", Jews don't face widespread societal discrimination in most countries, and many Jews hold positions of power.  So if that's your understanding of racism, how can there possibly be societal discrimination against Jews?

Also, I don't appreciate you belittling me with your language and referring to it as \"stupid\" and \"filled with hate\" and other such condemnations. I did not personally attack you, and I would appreciate if you at least showed me the same respect.\n\nI've seen enough of E;R to know that he is a reprehensible human being. The specific video in question (his [\"THE LAST DEATH NOTE;R (PART 1)\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njmCtiO_Xj8) video) is full of fascist sentiment and other hateful propaganda. For example, approximately 37 minutes into the video, he makes references to the aforementioned Heather Heyer. To quote him verbatim: \"So, for example, say you write the name of a woman and that she will die of being struck by a car. However, there\u2019s too much shit in the way for a car to hit her. Because the situation is impossible, and thus the cause of death as well, the woman would die of a heart attack.\u201d As I mentioned before, that lie was invented by American white supremacists to mislead and distract the public from the fact that Heyer was murdered. If she had really died of a heart attack, I doubt that [James Fields Jr. would be going to jail for life for murder.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/james-a-fields-jr-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-in-charlottesville-car-attack/2018/12/11/8b205a90-fcc8-11e8-ad40-cdfd0e0dd65a_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.6fb389bcb0dd) In addition to the varying degrees of visible white supremacy, Nazism, and other far-right dogwhistling, evidence of E;R's hate can be found in the description of the same video, wherein he says \"The truth about why this took so long is because I thought it was so funny to call Black L \u201cN*glet\u201d throughout all my recordings,\" (censored because I know automod doesn't like people throwing racial slurs around, but it's not censored in the slightest in the description), a blatant racial slur, as well as referring to his Patreon as a \"Shameless Shekel Shakedown,\" another anti-semitic dogwhistle. This goes and-in-hand with the majority of E;R's content, none of which is supposed to be satirical, though he may claim it is, because, as the copypasta goes, \"satire requires a clarity of purpose and target lest it be mistaken for and contribute to that which it intends to criticize.\"\n\nFor a man who you claim to be not racist, Stefan Molyneux sure has an obsession with race and IQ, particularly how much more superior the \"white race\" is in general. He's made claims that [organ donation between \"races\" is impossible due to the alleged inherent differences between them](https://twitter.com/StefanMolyneux/status/1071825748707631106), that [non-white people (specifically black and Latinx people) are inherently inferior to whites](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/stefan-molyneux), not to mention all the other hateful rhetoric about women and Jewish people, and, just recently, he [took a trip to Poland which apparently sold him on white supremacy](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/stefan-molyneux-says-his-trip-to-poland-sold-him-on-white-nationalism/). On his visit, he stated: \u201cI\u2019ve always been skeptical of the ideas of white nationalism, of identitarianism and white identity. However, I am an empiricist and I could not help but notice that I could have peaceful, free, easy, civilized and safe discussions in what is essentially an all-white country.\u201d Molyneux is apparently so skeptical of white supremacy that it only took a few incorrect hot takes about a country to sell him on the idea.\n\nWhile Paul Joseph Watson may not be an outright white supremacist, he's still very alt-right, and that's still a problem (which is why I classified him under a wide umbrella of hateful right-wing types, because not all right-wing hate groups are the same and not inherently directly connected to each other). Watson is very much akin to Alex Jones, who needs no introduction as an unhinged lunatic, and, despite many of his videos being named \"The Truth About X,\" he sure does a lot of lying and misleading to \"prove\" his point, whatever it may be. His entire persona is built on misleading people into believing lies and other misconceptions. One of his favorites is attacking feminism, as he claims that that [people who believe in equal rights for women are physically unattractive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwYN7l--3oY) [time](https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet/status/822104534692536320) and [time](https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet/status/707537693811609600), because, y'know, personal beliefs and physical attractiveness are always completely interchangeable. So, white supremacist? No, but he's a hatemonger all the same, and the fact that Pewdiepie associates with him at all is a telling sign that perhaps Felix is being led along the path of blind conservative malice.\n\nDave Rubin is an American centrist in the same way that Boogie2988 is an American centrist, as he claims to be in the political center, yet goes out of his way to exclusively criticize the left-wing, such as with Boogie's [\"some good came out of the Holocaust\" statements](https://twitter.com/RantingF/status/1047877190614806528) and other, similar musings. Rubin is alt-right in the sense that he goes out of his way to invite more \"outspoken\" alt-righters onto his show (such as the aforementioned Molyneux, far-right conspiracy theorist and \"[guy who does not believe that rape is an actual thing](http://archive.is/S0Sra)\" Mike Cernovich, and Glenn Beck, who needs no introduction as an intolerant fool) and does very little (if not nothing at all) to oppose those views, going out of his way to give them a platform. The few people from the left that Rubin *does* invite onto his show are met with skepticism and judgement that the right-wing interviewees do not face. Thus, Rubin is a centrist in his mind only. I do not appreciate you putting words in my mouth about Rubin being a racist, as I included him under the wide umbrella of right-wing hatemongers because, like Watson, being part of the alt-right sphere of thought does not necessarily immediately make you an avowed racist.\n\nBefore I go into discussing Ben Shapiro, I would ask you to please rethink referring to a Jewish person as \"a Jew.\" I am not accusing you of intolerance, but please know that referring to Jewish people in that way is very historically loaded and many people may take exception to that. Again, not accusing you of anything, but please be mindful of this in the future.\n\nWith that out of the way, you first claim that Ben Shapiro is not a conservative, then you refer to him as a conservative for the rest of your argument. Perhaps I'm missing the sarcasm. Regardless, Shapiro is alt-right and he is racist. For example, [this tweet](https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/116002989570920448?lang=en) lays very bare how willing he is to go around directly saying that black \"thugs\" will never amount to anything in life, which is racist. In addition, he has made racially-biased, sweeping - and, frankly, absurd - [claims about people from the Middle East](https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/25712847277) that are very obviously steeped in bigotry. In addition, Shapiro is an [avowed transphobe](https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/932504794328993797). Though you claim that he uses rationality over emotion (I believe he calls it \"facts don't care about your feelings\"), I would say that this is incorrect, as he is the purveyor of several outlandish conspiracy theories, including, but not limited to, believing that [*Sesame Street* is liberal propaganda](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W1NURCkQHM) and [climate change denial](http://cinemaunrest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Addams-Family-Values-1993-06.jpg), as well as the aforementioned racist and transphobic comments. As for his Jewish beliefs and heritage, I do not appreciate you talking down to me in saying that I'm \"disconnected from reality.\" Just because he is Jewish does not mean that he cannot be [racist or conservative at all](https://jewishjournal.com/opinion/175787/).\n\nThe whole reason I'm having this conversation right now is not because I have some hateful agenda against conservatives or want \"civil war\" but because the beliefs of the people that I mentioned are beliefs of hate, and they are being espoused by the most subscribed-to YouTuber on the site (over [66 million](https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/biggest-youtube-channels/2/)), further spreading hateful rhetoric among literal millions of people. This is not about spreading opinions I personally dislike so much as it is about spreading downright falsifications and further encouraging the people who perpetrate them.\n\nIf you felt personally attacked by anything I have said, I sincerely apologize. My goal is to spread tolerance and understanding to minority groups in America and other historically underrepresented and disenfranchised individuals, not direct blind rage towards anybody that I deem \"deplorable.\"\n\nHave a happy Boxing Day.\n\nEDIT: a word was missing a \"t\".\n\nEDIT 2: as if this wasn't long-winded enough, I forgot to include a link to Sir Karl Popper's [\"The Open Society and its Enemies\"](https://monoskop.org/images/4/42/Popper_Karl_The_Open_Society_and_its_Enemies_The_Spell_of_Plato_Vol_1_1st_ed.pdf), but if you don't have time to read that (understandable, as it's pretty long), this [infographic about the Paradox of Intolerance](http://wy3mg1xgify37n21x223cw7xl1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/HcuZIT5w8xJLMXoISDexG1GNz5Dj7xHO_QGeueMtdPU.jpg) should further explain why I believe in the imminent danger that the alt-right and their constituents pose to wider society.", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Gamingcirclejerk", "date_year_month": "2018-12", "created_utc_converted": "2018-12-27 02:11:47", "score_overall": 9, "words": "jewish holocaust conspiracy jewish jew jewish conspiracy jewish jewish", "shared_words": "jewish holocaust conspiracy jew", "socre_distint": 4}

Kennedy had received over 80% of the Jewish vote in his 1960 election, American Jews featured very prominently in his White House, and he was greatly lionized by Jewish media figures, celebrities, and intellectuals ranging from New York City to Hollywood to the Ivy League. \n\n&gt;Moreover, individuals with a Jewish background such as Mark Lane and Edward Epstein had been among the leading early proponents of an assassination conspiracy, with their controversial theories championed by influential Jewish cultural celebrities such as Mort Sahl and Norman Mailer. Given that the Kennedy Administration was widely perceived as pro-Israel, there seemed no possible motive for any Mossad involvement, and bizarre, totally unsubstantiated accusations of such a monumental nature directed against the Jewish state were hardly likely to gain much traction in an overwhelmingly pro-Israel publishing industry.\n\n&gt;**However, in the early 1990s highly-regarded journalists and researchers began exposing the circumstances surrounding the development of Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal. Seymour Hersh\u2019s 1991 book The Samson Option: Israel\u2019s Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy described the extreme efforts of the Kennedy Administration to force Israel to allow international inspections of its allegedly non-military nuclear reactor at Dimona, and thereby prevent its use in producing nuclear weapons.** Dangerous Liaisons: The Inside Story of the U.S.-Israeli Covert Relationship by Andrew and Leslie Cockburn appeared in the same year, and covered similar ground.\n\n&gt;Although entirely hidden from public awareness at the time, the early 1960s political conflict between the American and Israeli governments over nuclear weapons development had represented a top foreign policy priority of the Kennedy Administration, which had made nuclear non-proliferation one of its central international initiatives. It is notable that John McCone, Kennedy\u2019s choice as CIA Director, had previously served on the Atomic Energy Commission under Eisenhower, being the individual who leaked the fact that Israel was building a nuclear reactor to produce plutonium.\n\n&gt;The pressure and financial aid threats secretly applied to Israel by the Kennedy Administration eventually became so severe that they led to the resignation of Israel\u2019s founding Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion in June 1963. But all these efforts were almost entirely halted or reversed once Kennedy was replaced by Johnson in November of that same year. \n\n&gt;Piper notes that Stephen Green\u2019s 1984 book Taking Sides: America\u2019s Secret Relations With a Militant Israel had previously documented that U.S. Middle East Policy completely reversed itself following Kennedy\u2019s assassination, but this important finding had attracted little attention at the time.\n\n\n\n&gt;Skeptics of a plausible institutional basis for a JFK assassination conspiracy have often noted the extreme continuity in both foreign and domestic policies between the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, arguing that this casts severe doubt on any such possible motive. **Although this analysis seems largely correct, America\u2019s behavior towards Israel and its nuclear weapons program stands as a very notable exception to this pattern.**\n\n&gt;**An additional major area of concern for Israeli officials may have involved the efforts of the Kennedy Administration to sharply restrict the activities of pro-Israel political lobbies.** During his 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy had met in New York City with a group of wealthy Israel advocates, led by financier Abraham Feinberg, and they had offered enormous financial support in exchange for a controlling influence in Middle Eastern policy. \n\n&gt;Kennedy managed to fob them off with vague assurances, but he considered the incident so troubling that the next morning he sought out journalist Charles Bartlett, one of his closest friends, and expressed his outrage that American foreign policy might fall under the control of partisans of a foreign power, promising that if he became president, he would rectify that situation. \n\n&gt;And indeed, once he had installed his brother Robert as Attorney General, the latter initiated a major legal effort to force pro-Israel groups to register themselves as foreign agents, which would have drastically reduced their power and influence. But after JFK\u2019s death, this project was quickly abandoned, and as part of the settlement, the leading pro-Israel lobby merely agreed to reconstitute itself as AIPAC.\n\n\n[Jack Ruby](https://web.archive.org/web/20180710041833/https://forward.com/news/187793/lee-harvey-oswalds-killer-jack-ruby-came-from-stro/):\n\n&gt;Lee Harvey Oswald's Killer 'Jack Ruby' Came From Strong Jewish Background\n\n&gt;(JTA) \u2014 We were sharing a pastrami sandwich and pickles at the Los Angeles landmark Canter\u2019s Deli. I was 24. She was nearly 50 years older, with a piercing voice as loud as her flaming red wig.\n\n&gt;**Her name was Eva Rubenstein Grant, and she was a little-known nightclub manager the morning of Nov. 24, 1963, when her brother left the apartment they shared in Dallas and blasted his way into infamy by fatally shooting Lee Harvey Oswald. It was history\u2019s first live televised murder.**\n\n&gt;...Despite their dysfunctional world, the Rubensteins kept a kosher home, observed the holidays, sent their boys to Hebrew school and attended synagogue.\n\n&gt;Ruby idolized Chicago Jewish boxing champion Barney Ross, who later described him as a \u201cwell-behaved\u201d youth. But others recall Ruby\u2019s hair-trigger temper and street brawls, especially when taunted by the non-Jews in his mixed Jewish-Italian neighborhood. Ruby\u2019s biographer, Seth Kantor, relates that as an Air Force private, Ruby once beat up a sergeant who called him \u201ca Jew bastard.\u201d\n\n\n&gt;...**According to evidence uncovered by the U.S. House of Representatives Assassinations Committee in the 1970s, Ruby was later linked to mobsters Carlos Marcello and Santos Traficante, who the panel considered prime suspects in a possible mob conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy.**\n\n&gt;Whatever he was doing behind the scenes, Ruby became known as a nightclub owner and at some point began attending services at Congregation Shearith Israel. Rabbi Hillel Silverman, who was the Dallas synagogue\u2019s spiritual leader from 1954 to 1964, says Ruby came to say Kaddish for his father.\n\n&gt;\u201cHe came to minyan one day with a cast on his arm,\u201d Silverman recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018Jack, what happened?\u2019 He said, \u2018In my club, somebody was very raucous, and I was the bouncer.\u2019 \u201d\n\n&gt;Silverman, now 89 and still leading High Holy Days services every year, remembers Ruby well. Once Ruby showed up at the rabbi\u2019s house with a litter of puppies and insisted the rabbi take one. When the family went to Israel one summer, Ruby looked after the dog.\n\n&gt;\u201c**The day of the assassination, we had our regular Friday night service, which became a memorial service for the president,\u201d Silverman said. \u201cJack was there. People were either irate or in tears, and Jack was neither. He came over and said, \u2018Good Shabbos, rabbi. Thank you for visiting my sister Eva in the hospital last week.\u2019 I thought that was rather peculiar.**\u201d\n\n&gt;Two days later, Silverman spoke to his Sunday morning confirmation class, expressing relief to the students that Lee Harvey Oswald was not Jewish or there might have been a \u201cpogrom\u201d in Dallas. He then switched on the radio and heard that a \u201cJack Rubenstein\u201d had killed the assassin.\n\n\n\n", "score": 7, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "conspiracyundone", "date_year_month": "2018-12", "created_utc_converted": "2018-12-28 07:44:12", "score_overall": 16, "words": "conspiracy illuminati jewish jewish jewish conspiracy jewish jewish conspiracy jewish kosher jewish jewish jew conspiracy jewish", "shared_words": "conspiracy illuminati jewish kosher jew", "socre_distint": 5}
{"archived": false, "author": "chayyim_ben_david", "body": "&gt;Israel grants citizenship (through an accelerated process) to any Jewish person who comes from anywhere in the world while it denies the same to everybody else. \n\nSort of, there are limiting factors that can prevent a Jew from immigrating. Also several other nations have this right. Sweden for instance will allow those with Swedish blood to immigrate; Germany and Austria offer the same program and so do several other nations. Why you're only focusing on Israel for a very common practice in immigration is beyond me?\n\n&gt;This right is given as is, no questions asked, no strings attached. \n\nAgain that is not true there are strings attached. For instance the person making the Aliyah cannot have any felonies or be under investigation. My great cousin Meyer Lansky was turned away because he was under investigation. Despite the charges being dropped later on they still wouldn't let him in. Of course Israel has accepted all the women in my family, but we men have had a harder time of it.\n\nAlso you have to get an Apostille which means the native country of the migrant also has the recognize the Law of Return and sign off on all their documents. If they don't then the migrant won't be able to easily enact the Law of Return. Possibly the Jewish Agency would smuggle them out and to Israel, but that would be an extreme and special case.\n\n&gt;This is in contrast with migration laws in other countries.\n\nAgain its not in contrast as Austria offered me a Birthright because I come from a Austrian Jewish family that they killed off the majority of during the Holocaust. They also offered me blood money, but I accepted neither.\n\n&gt;For example, Scandinavian countries grant asylum/residency based on humanitarian conditions to Syrians, Kurds and Palestinians.\n\nWell, no but also yes. I was a refugee in Sweden so I've seen this system at work. They don't really give a damn about the \"humanitarian conditions\" so much as they do the money they can get from the EU and UN for temporarily accepting refugees. For everyone that begins the process the host nation gets paid to care for, then the host is welcome to deny them and ship them back. Sweden and Denmark got in a huge row over this very practice in 2015 because in 2014 Denmark got a bunch of refugee money, then denied everyone and sent them to Sweden. Sweden in return did the same exact thing and sent them to Denmark just after enacting boarder patrols to prevent refugees from filing a second time in Sweden. Denmark got pissed. Sweden got pissed. Its been one of the major talking points in elections since. \n\nI can understand why the point on Scandinavia was missed. Unless you speak one of the languages then you're not going to get this information. The debates/serious talks are all in their native tongues and the media is state controlled for the most part. On the bright side since it is state controlled there is less meta-data sale from their websites. For instance www.svt.se doesn't cache things locally where as the BBC does. \n\n&gt;I understand that such a law is based on the past history of antisemitism and pogroms, yet I fail to see why this right is still automatic to this day. \n\nActually the Law of Return is based on historical legal and religious president. It is one of the oldest laws in Israel. There is more to the Jewish people and the nation of Israel than the Holocaust. Why you're considering anything involving Israel as being directly related to the Holocaust is beyond me?\n\n&gt;My interest in this is that obviously it feels that with every unneeded Jew coming to Israel (esp. from North America), the rights and resources of an indigenous person (who was born there - Jewish or non-Jewish) are diminished. \n\nIt would seem to make sense that except for the economic figures of it. The economic model of Israel is centered around immigration. Its known as a Start-Up nation specifically because of migrants who had absolutely nothing showing up and someone locally in Israel investing in them.  Besides the Jews of North America are heavily oppressed and need access to this right to escape the antisemitism that exists within Canada and the United States of America. For instance both countries force Jews to pay tribute to Christians through additional taxation to fund the Christian sabbath. Our customs are nearly completely criminalized and there is literally a War on Jews that President Nixon started because Bob and him thought we smoked too much pot. North America is much worse than you think, but you've chosen to blind yourself to the plight of the Jewish people there so you don't see or understand it.\n\n&gt;When we look at the worst settlers in the West Bank, they are mostly foreign-born who moved to Israel mostly due to their failures back home and not because they were under any threat, economic, political or physical whatsoever.\n\nTo be honest it was the same exact case for most of the Palestinians that flooded the West Bank from the previous generation. None the less most move because they were being taxed additionally for being Jewish and risked being put in prison for keeping Kosher like Agriprocessors was. Then currently on the right we get heat from the white supremacist antisemities whereas on the left we get heat because Jared Kushner is a Jewish person who Pres. Trump is related to. Again there is also the mandatory tribute to cover the Christian pay premium on their sabbath and the enforced recognition of Christian holidays like Christmas. Not to mention the Christian indoctrination that goes on in the \"secular\" public education that complete ignores Semitic history instead focusing on Christian and Greco-Roman history.\n\n&gt;They moved to the settlements and their main contribution to Israel or humanity is killing or harassing the Palestinians.\n\nExcept when they are pulling in major business. For example Oracle just moved to Israel because of a Jewish-American immigrant. 3DSignals, Nsof Networds, Bonono.ai, Toonimo, and Zoomin are also all Jewish-American led start-ups in Israel. There are whole web searches with pages of companies started by Jewish-American Olim. Just search it and you'll quickly see the contribution. However I understand murder is upsetting which is why Israel put the Israelis responsible in prison. Unlike the Palestinians who rewarded the murders of:\n\n* Eyal Yifrach\n* Gilad Shaar\n* Naftali Fraenkel\n\nIf apologies are needed then they are truly needed on both sides. As for the video... So you found some wanker with an opinion. Do you really want me to post one of the several IS recruitment videos on YouTube from the Palestinian side?\n\n&gt;Oh and the xenophobic American researcher works for the Simon Wisenthal centre. Yes, the same centre that has just added Airbnb and UNRWA to the list of antisemites of 2018\n\nI mean it was pretty antisemitic to straight up refuse to do business with only Jews in a specific region. It is a form of discrimination and discrimination against Jews is antisemitism. \n\n&gt;I think Israel needs to tighten its migration laws. A French or American Jew who lives in an environment where the Jews are more protected than anybody else in the whole world shouldn't be automatically admitted to Israel just because. Needless to say that they form a burden on the economy since they are not needed per se and their dominant trait of extremism actually make it difficult for everybody else to live together. \n\nAs far as anyone being xenophobic it is clearly you who are the xenophobe. Every Zionist did the most un-xenophobic thing by packing up their things and literally moving to a \"xeno\" region.

{"archived": false, "author": "mizrahim", "body": "&gt; You're missing the point that they DID live there\n\nWhat is your point? My argument is that a Jew being \"Polish\" or \"Iraqi\" isn't something intrinsic but rather something decided by Europeans splitting up lands.  \n\n&gt; Israel is more like the USA in that they genocided people to then colonize the empty space.\n\nThis is wrong for multiple reasons. Firstly, The Palestinian population has quadrupled in the last century. That's not genocide. If you look at the entire conflict the death toll of Jews isn't much lower then the death toll of Arabs. The second, and more important point is that the only people living in lands which used to be Palestinian villages are certain kibbutzniks and the Jews in Lod/Ramle. Petah Tikva, Netanya, Holon, Ramat Gan, Rehovot, Bat Yam, Bnei Brak, Herzilya, Rishon LeZion, Hawera, Ra'anana. None of those cities existed before Zionism, and they weren't built on land taken from Arabs or anyone for that matter.\n\n&gt; Wow really? I guess Rosa Luxemburg was a real geographical oddity then!\n\n\nShe was. Most Jews did not speak any other language than Yiddish, the ones that did were middle/upper-class assimilated Jews. This is why it was so easy to identify them during the Holocaust, meanwhile an assimilated Jew without the accent could pass.\n\n&gt; Well, why would all the Jews then be able to coexist? They don't share anything except their religion, but their ethnicities are different, since both are an identity.\n\nI'm glad you asked this. Firstly, we share a lot more than just religion. We have languages, calendar, foods, music, everything that makes up a people we have. \n\n&gt; So why would a Jewish state be able to be without ethnic conflict if it has various ethnicities in it? \n\nBecause we recognize that we are a multi-ethnic group due to diaspora. \nAlso something like 40% of Israeli children are mixed. \n\n&gt; And in fact, isn't this literally what Israel is? I seem to remember them chemically castrating black jews and kidnapping arabic jews for the benefit of the Ashkenazi Jews IIRC.\n\nThe vast majority of Jews in Israel get along with each other great regardless of race or ethnicity. Nobody ever got castrated. An Israeli doctor gave about a dozen Beta Israel women birth control without fully explaining to them it's duration (it lasted 3 months). They were able to have children after, and they weren't forced to take it. The controversy was over the fact that the type of birth control they offered them wasn't the typical kind they gave to recent immigrants. That doctor lady was clearly racist as hell, but to take that and say the Israeli government is \"castrating\" their black population makes no sense. As far as \"kidnapping Mizrahim for the benefit of Ashkenazim,\" the same thing that happened to Yemenite children happened to some Ashkenazi children as well, most notably a Holocaust survivor couple. Personally I think it was sheer incompetence rather than a conspiracy to take children away from their parents and give them to \"more deserving\" parents.
