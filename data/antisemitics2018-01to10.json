{"author": "X_I_C", "body": "Alright, well it is complicated...but I will try my best to simplify it (just to fit it in the comments section).\n\nThere are two jewish crime syndicates (global mafia) that are fighting each other for control.  You have the Pax Americana syndicate that wants to retain control via by the MIC and PIC (prison industrial complex) but they both have the same basic goals outlined in the Protocols.  This idea that a jewish global world order can't very well fight 'wars' because it is global dominance so it must fight 'terrorism' at a local scale.\n\nSo the Eastern jew empire (EJE) of dispersed globalists (Russian/Hindu/Chinese) against the Western jew empire (WJE) nationalist globalist (European/American/South American).  Neither of these groups give one flying fuck about ordinary people and would happily murder you as soon as look at you, they are so clinically insane psychopaths and very removed from anything we think of as reality or humanity.  See 'eastern rite' freemasonry vs 'western' as secret societies are also divided into these two opposing camps of psychopaths.\n\n##EJE - Chabad/Orthodox/Likud Loyalist\n\nKushner - ['Chabad Ubermensch or 'superman''] (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/opinion/jared-kushner-man-of-steel.html)\n\nTrump - 'puppet/mentor was jewish Roy Cohn (homosexual, blackmailer. pedophile supporter) who he learned 'his trade' from\n\nPutin, and the oligarchs, etc (defenders of Syrian pipelines)\n\nKhazarian Mafia\n\nLobbying for Astana (Khazariah) as head\n\nPatriarch Kirill (Eastern Orthodox head of one of the 'daughter religions/semitic mind control' of Mystery Babylon the destroyers of the earth)\n\nBRICS - physical monetary standard\n\nThere is some weird stuff going on in banking right now too...there are Rothschild controlled banks that are currently and in the recent past liquidating non-RC banks.  Many of the 'Executive Order Mafia' which are just another side of the psychopaths (not a better or worse one) are on the hit list of the Executive Order.\n\n##WJE - Reformed/Satanist/B'nai Loyalists\n\nClinton - Eastern European Mafia\n\nSoros \n\nAdelson (basically runs almost all of the US government via bribes; is trying to bring abject slavery and absolute control to the USA via backscatter and other surveillance state which will help foment the 'terrorism' bloodshed required by their god in order to remain 'on top' of the NWO/JWO)\n\nRothschilds\n\nLobbying for 'Israel' as head\n\nSaudi Mafia\n\nCatholic Pope (Western Branch of the semitic Mystery Babylon semitic mind control 'religion')\n\nMark Rich (BCCI scandal and takedown of the entire oil wealth of all of Iraq [was 5th richest nation in the world when the BCCI was looted overnight], etc etc\n\nCryptocurrency - Fiat money standard\n\n##Las Vegas\n\nSo these two side meet in Las Vegas and many other cities...the EJE Mafia has an increasing presence in Vegas alongside the WJC.  They both require Ritual Human Sacrifice of 'cattle'/human beings before their god to achieve their goal of total global domination.  So they come together before their temple for a 'Harvest' ritual.  Keep in mind that the whole goal, from the inception of the Babylonian Yah 'religion' was to raise a 'crop' off the Earth for slaughter (it was the canaanite god Yah's proof of his legitimacy before the other gods).  This is the entire point of the Revelation in their bible, the harvest of the Earth by their god.\n\n&gt;\"Wars are the Jews\u2019 harvest, for with them we wipe out the Christians and get control of their gold. We have already killed 100 million of them, and the end is not yet.\"\n\n ~ Chief Rabbi in France, in 1859, Rabbi Reichorn\n\n&gt;And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.\n\nRevelations 14:15\n\n&gt;\"And the Gentiles, in their stupidity, have proved easier dupes than we expected them to be. One would expect more intelligence and more practical common sense, but they are no better than a herd of sheep. **Let them graze in our fields till they become fat enough to be worthy of being immolated (burnt alive; moloch/cremation of care ceremonies) to our King of the World.\"** \n\n- The Jewish Peril\n\nSo patsy Paddock a drug (afghanistan), gun (and probably human trafficker; infant and child) pilot who fit the bill to also be ritually murdered due to his name 'Paddock' or sheep pen.  Out of the entire debacle Beilman (suicide) is probably the only innocent.  The whole ritual is highly coded to help ensure that this transition period into the JWO went smoothly.  Anytime you see a 'jewish ritual murder' of civilians it will always be shrouded in 'secrecy' or 'unsolved'...because GOD FUCKING FORBID that you look into a Ritual Human Sacrifice to see the inner workings of their Babylonian Kabbalah Black Magic.  There was never going to 'be an answer' to the following TERRORIST EVENTS with full cooperation of your 'government' I might add:\n\n&gt;Fukushima (unsolved)\n\n&gt;9/11 (unsolved)\n\n&gt;Argentinian Embassy Bombing (unsolved)\n\n&gt;JFK (ritual murder; unsolved)\n\n&gt;Oklahoma Federal Building (unsolved)\n\n&gt;MA370 (unsolved)\n\non and on and on...all of these are terrorist black magic or environmental terrorism events\n\nSo the purpose of the Vegas ritual was to bind the two warring factions into one, via the ritual for the Harvest of Humanity.  Now some people I know, who are more knowledgeable than I am believe that all the 'phoenix rising' public rituals refer to the Holocaust of Humanity via large scale nuclear war in the entire Northern Hemisphere and then a eternal jew kingdom along the lines of Geidi Prime, so the entire planet would be fashioned in absolute depths of depravity and darkness that simply can't be imagined by humanity currently as the jewish god requires thick darkness and massive human sacrifice, suffering, murder and torture to please it.  \n\nI did gather that the ritual had some hiccups (but keep in mind that these plans are laid out in hundreds of year spans...**so after a little 'cleanup' of the unwilling and law abiding parts of the government; everything should 'go forwards smoothly'**).  Right now the criminal pedophiles and human sacrificers are furious that they are being regulated by what is left of the USA government and there is a clear plan to exterminate those in government who are 'on the wrong side' (that is those who are still ethical and willing to uphold the law and bring these mafia to task).\n\nGod I can't even tell if I answered your question...I have a horrid cold right now and I can barely type...I realize I did a shit job of sourcing these because I feel like crap, if you want I can maybe tomorrow go back in and source them for you...the rest of tonight I am going to chill out and relax.\n\n\n", "score": 1, "subreddit": "GentilesUnited", "date_year_month": "2018-01", "created_utc_converted": "2018-01-02 02:33:14", "score_overall": 11, "words": "jewish jewish jew jew globalist jewish jewish jewish holocaust jew jewish", "shared_words": "jewish jew globalist holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "steam50", "body": "Don't entirely remember the source of that quote. Just paraphrasing it.\n\nYou're right about that. It's just that most of the time Jew hate comes from the fact that ninety-nine times out of one hundred these globalist elites are Jewish, and that like any other race Jews band together no matter where they are. National Socialists (i.e. Hitler's brand of fascism- viewing the state as a means to protect the race and the people, rather than being the total measure of society) allow the rich to exist, but their economic system works on a restricted measure where usury and things like planned obsolescence don't fly. This is an incredibly [good read](http://i.4cdn.org/pol/1515127202920.png); particularly the bits on economy, that explains it better than I can.\n\nI agree that totally denying that Jews were ever persecuted is lame.

If you can blame your culture's economic woes on a group of people who are separate enough to be neatly targeted and excised, they make a perfect scapegoat.\n\nThis is also cyclical.

{"author": "streetpreacher2", "body": "Hey r/Christianity, I have an idea for a game, let's take everything you say about Christians, and just replace the word Christian with the word Jewish and see if that makes you guys sound like Nazis or self hating Jews.  \n\n&gt;The American Jewish persecution complex is death \n\n&gt;So I was watching a trailer for the movie \u201cchosen and excluded \u2013 the hate on Jews\u201d \nI want to argue this morning that the narrative films like this present is deeply anti-Jewish.  How so, these films encourage what many people call the \u201cAmerican Jewish Persecution Complex\u201d  (AJPC for short).  This is the idea that Jews are under attack here in America and that Jewish have a responsibility to protect themselves and see Jews in a priviledged and influencial position in American culture. \nThis idea isn\u2019t just pushed on the movie screen, but also in modern day politics.  Figures like the jewish illuminati, the Rothschilds and them Hollywood Jews and most notably Bernie Sanders are the main engines pushing this view forward. \nThe AJPC is deeply un torah and cancer to the work of Good Jews on Earth \u2013 the kind who just stay quiet and in their place.  I believe AJPC is deeply wrong for two reasons.  \n\n1. It\u2019s not true.  Jew\u2019s are supposed to value truth, their torah says do not live.  They shouldn\u2019t believe things just because they want to believe it\u2019s true or make themselves feel special.  It seems to me a lot of people like the idea of feeling persecuted because it makes them feel special, like gays, muslims and blacks for example, and for remaining faithful even when things get costly.   And there are some events which would suggest this idea of Jewish persecution.  Sure some Synagogues get defaced or burned and some orthodox Jews are hauled into court and charged for practicing their religious believes.   Society is getting more secular atheist humanstic, and that scares a lot of the Jewish illuminati elite.  Also, the Torah did say to expect persecution.  He wanted them that Judaism brings with it inherent risks, and that is why they shouldn\u2019t make such a big deal out of me painting swastikas on their homes. \n\nThe problem with that thinking is that the risks that the Torah was talking about is simply not occurring in the United States.  When we talk about Jewish persecution, it doesn\u2019t mean orthodox Jews being hauled into court for following their religious views.  It doesn\u2019t mean that an Orthodox Jewish student will fail his class because he refuses to sign a paper signaling the death of god.  When we say persecution, we mean life or death, like the holocaust.  So unless you\u2019re getting thorwn into concentration camps, shut up about it okay.  To argue that American Jews face persuection is belitting the real struggle of Jews in the middle east and all the Jews that died during the holocaust. \n\n1. This leads me to the second and more important reason why the \u201cAmerican Jewish Perseuction Complex\u2019 is cancer to the mission of Jesus.  The AJPC encourages Jews to think themselves as victims whenever my buddies and I beat them in the streets or vandalize their places of worship.  \u201cOh my Jewish beliefs are under attack,\u201d \u201cour Jewish freedoms are under attack\u201d \u201cour values are under attack.\u201d \n\n&gt;Many American Jews have bought into this narrative of \u201cAnti-Semitism\u201d . . . as if that were a thing.  And because of this, it\u2019s fair to say they seem themselves as victims.  Here is the problem.  Victims are motivated by fear, desperation.  That\u2019s not the message of YHWH or whoever they worship.   These Jews support clear narcissists like Ariel Sharon because they think he will offer them political power and cultural influence and relevance.  Jews are primarily known, by the anti-Jewish community, for messing around with American politics to protect the state of Israel.  \n\n&gt;But consider the attitude of men like Abraham and Moses.  Now those are guys who were actually persecuted, unlike you Jews of today. They were beaten countless times, and they thanked God for it \u2013 why can\u2019t you Jews be more like that. \nDespite everything these guys experience in their lives they did not consider themselves victims.  They understood that when Jews make themselves out to be victims, they cheapen the of their God.  When they see themselves as victims, they are no longer doing the ministry of YHWH\u2019s kingdom in victory but defending and persevering their own honor and glory.  How dare they defend themselves. \n\n&gt;If society is becoming more anti-semitic, it\u2019s because God is using that cultural movement ot bring about his purposes.  Jews are called to remain others focused and on mission, no matter what cultural movement they find themselves.  \n\n&gt;Jews are called to fight for justice and bring the law to the ends of the earth.  Both projects are other focused.  They cannot be accomplished by those who are motived by fear, self-interest and victim-hood.

{"author": "hanikrummihundursvin", "body": "You seem, to me, to be conceptualizing of this in a very odd way. \n\nThere is no necessity for a link between a jewish person performing an action that is possibly harmful to whites in one area and another jewish person performing a possibly harmful action to whites in another. The connection is simply that both are jewish.\n\nAs an example:\n\nBlacks are a negative to white societies.(if we use US as an example) That does not mean that third time repeat offender Tyrone is in cahoots with welfare queen Shaniqua and her 7 children. There is no connection between the acts. The connection is between the two things being bad and the two people being black. This connection is then expanded and when we look at averages we see a majority of blacks engage in the actions to the detriment of white society. We then say: The blacks engaging in these types of action are a negative to white society and cause harm to it. \n\nTo take jews as an example:\n\nA globalist \"philanthropist\" like Soros work towards goals that are, in the opinion of the AR, very negative to white society. Being pro third world immigration being a prime example. At the same time AIPAC works towards lobbying for Israel and its interest. The acts are not connected. The connection is the foreign ethnic group pushing their own interest over whites. When then expand the connection and see that most jews are pro-Israel, pro-SJW or both.

{"author": "Illin_Spree", "body": "Well, I can't think of a specific example of a overtly racist Jew off the top of my head, outside of Likudites and supporters of Likud style racialism.  To some extent the existence a \"Jewish State\" on formerly Palestinian territory is implicitly racist (although it is precisely this aspect that alt-righters and fascists tend to admire most), so people who openly support these concepts could be thought of as racist.  \n\nTheoretically a Jew that has Zionist/racist views, or who sees Goyim as a means (or as lesser generally), would probably meet the criteria in the sense that they are racist in the same sense a white supremacist (especially one that would justifiy slavery and/or exploitation of other races) is considered racist.  Admittedly such people rarely publicize their views.  So if you can think of a character that meets that criteria maybe we can agree.  \n\nI'm not aware of anything in Trotsky's writings to indicate he was either a racist (beyond the commonplace prejudice against non-whites of the time, which is not equal to scientific rascism) or a Zionist.  As I noted earlier, Solzhenitsyn (a writer much praised and respected by \"race realists\") investigated the matter and found no evidence that Trotsky was an ethnic supremacist.   \n\nIn fact Trotsky and his comrades were Marxist socialists, who were considered renegades by Zionists, and they set up a regime that eventually led to mass emigration of ethnic Jews (to Israel and the USA), in part because they felt their economic opportunities were limited.  So one of the reasons the \"Bolshevism as an ethnic conspiracy\" theory fails to stand up to scrutiny is that M-L dictatorship is a far more inefficient way for a supposed dominant ethnic group to maintain its power compared to capitalism.", "score": 1, "subreddit": "DebateFascism", "date_year_month": "2018-01", "created_utc_converted": "2018-01-07 20:10:27", "score_overall": 5, "words": "jew jewish jew goyim conspiracy", "shared_words": "jew jewish goyim conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

Some people blame them personally for everything. Entire nations in the Middle east are told by their leaders that everything bad is the Jews, but has nothing to do with their own shitty governments. I also think that historically, people invented shit about them so they could rob them. They are not that big in numbers and had no territory. European royalty would spread lies about them in order to not pay back loans, and confiscate their property through attacks. Unfortunately, a lot of that propaganda never went away. Is every Jew super great? No, they are people, some of them are dicks, some are awesome, most are somewhere in between. It just seems like every time someone says derogatory shit about them on T_D, it's always accounts that exist just to shit on them. To me, that seems like something Share Blue would do to make us look bad, or crazy, or whatever.\n\nI agree about the current administration of Israel. They are definitely being better allies right now than the *administrations* of the UK &amp; most of Western Europe. Israel has built their own wall, and also have declared George Soros to be an enemy of the state. Are there a lot of annoying liberal Jews? Sure. But there are also lots of conservative, moderate, and a-political Jews. You just don't ever hear from them.

But apparently many of my fellow Puerto Ricans\u2014more than I would have guessed, truth be told\u2014buy into these antisemitic conspiracy theories.  Sad.\n\nI've taken the initiative to translate the original column into English (hopefully not too clumsily) so our English-only readers can form their own impressions.  I'll paste it below.  Some notes to help people read it:\n\n* When Rodr\u00edguez says \"the colony\" she means Puerto Rico.\n* When she says \"the country\" (*el pa\u00eds* in Spanish) she usually means Puerto Rico, though there's one instance in the text where I wasn't sure whether it was a reference to Puerto Rico or the US.\n* Translation is not an exact science.  I've chosen idiomatic English phrases in a couple of spots over rendering the Spanish original literally.  I don't think I've strayed from the meaning of the original, but any corrections or suggestions are welcome.\n* **EDIT:** I should note the most important example of a translation difficulty: in a key, highly quoted passage I've translated Spanish *vulgar* into English *popular*.  So the passage *\u201cel jud\u00edo\u201d, como le llaman vulgarmente al prototipo del verdadero poder*, I've translated to *\u201cthe Jew,\u201d the popular term for the prototype of true power*.  Spanish *vulgar* can mean either the same thing as the English cognate, but also the same as in Latin: \"popular\" or \"folk (adj.).\"  But you can easily make the case for translating it as English *vulgar*, or something in between like *unlearned*.  Translation is hard.\n\n&gt; # What does \u201cthe Jew\u201d want with the colony?\n&gt;\n&gt; By Wilda Rodr\u00edguez  \n&gt; January 8, 2018  \n&gt; *El Nuevo D\u00eda* (Puerto Rico)\n&gt; \n&gt; ACLARATORY NOTE FROM El NUEVO D\u00cdA\u2019S OPINION EDITORS:  El Nuevo D\u00eda\u2019s  opinion editors apologizes to Puerto Rico\u2019s Jewish community and the rest of our readers who have been offended by the publication of the column \u201cWhat does \u2018the Jew\u2019 want with the colony?\u201d written by Wilda Rodr\u00edguez, published on January 8, 2018.  We take responsibility and wish to be absolutely emphatic in that we do not promote content that supports hate or prejudice based on gender, religion or ethnic race.\n&gt; \n&gt; ACLARATORY NOTE FROM COLUMNIST WILDA RODR\u00cdGUEZ: I am profoundly sorry that an article of mine is interpreted as antisemitic.  The path I\u2019ve always taken is clear.  Racial or religious prejudice or hatred have never been part of it.  I can understand the offense that some take at the mere use of the word \u201cJew.\u201d  But the intent is not to provoke offense, but rather to contribute to public discourse.  With that cleared up, I ask apologies from those who have in good faith felt wounded by my political analogy.  I don\u2019t have nor will I ever have the intention to offend you.\n&gt; \n&gt; We begin 2018 with the same uncertainty that last year left us with: what are the metropolis\u2019 plans with its colony?\n&gt; \n&gt; Contrary to many who seem to be sure that the plan is to \u201ccut it loose,\u201d I think the people who at this moment have the problem in their hands don\u2019t know what to do or don\u2019t care as much as we wish to believe.  What to do with an insolvent territory that has slipped from their hands precisely because of the greed of the system they\u2019ve implemented?  How to save their reputation of greatness and paternalistic generosity that they aspire to in the light of a failed relationship?  How much importance is given to the only colony that doubtfully keeps them in the category of an empire?\n&gt; \n&gt; We would have to know who are the ones called upon to make the decision.  To talk about the secret structure that rules the United States is a subject exclusive to an elite.  Only behind closed doors do the most illustrious politicians speak about US power as a parallel government organized by the forces of wealth and violence (war machinery) from Wall Street.  These same politicians insist that the country fixate only on 535 guys and gals that inhabit an enormous domed building in Washington DC and whose lane direction changes every two years.\n&gt; \n&gt; That diversion with what Congress thinks is what stops us from analyzing and arriving at intelligent conclusions about our country\u2019s possibilities for the future.  We are waiting for the American without knowing who is the American who is in charge in these cases.\n&gt; \n&gt; It\u2019s not Congress.  Congress in the end will do what\u2019s wanted by \u201cthe Jew,\u201d the popular term for the prototype of true power, with no intent to offend those who practice that religion.  More than 20 years ago the Israeli newspaper Ma\u2019ariv published an article that explained in Hebrew how Jews in the end controlled Washington.  For Israelis, acknowledging Jewish power over the United States is no offense.  It\u2019s the victory of their diaspora.\n&gt; \n&gt; So what is it then that \u201cthe Jew\u201d wants to do with the colony?  That is the question.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I think that the amount of thought \u201cthe Jew\u201d spends on us in his busy schedule of wars and profits isn\u2019t enough to come to a conclusion.  When we do come to his mind, he certainly things: what the heck are we still doing in there?  How do we get out of this trap?  We\u2019re going to have to think about that.  Let\u2019s see if tomorrow we spend a bit of time thinking about it.  Or next week.\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, it\u2019s not urgent for him like it is for us.  His life isn\u2019t riding on it like ours is.\n&gt; \n&gt; Certainly the $70 billion public debt isn\u2019t his great worry.  The debtors have already received their due in interest and more.  It\u2019s not the pocket, it\u2019s the speculator\u2019s \u201cmorale\u201d that is wounded.  If we were able to escape without some punishment would be fatal for morale in Wall Street.  We should be punished in some way.  In some other way because they already punish us quite a bit.  But, in their terms, the punishment would have to be evident so that debtors around the world understand not to mess with Wall Street.\n&gt; \n&gt; In those terms, we might think that this punishment could be political nd what better punishment for a people that \u201ctreasures\u201d their relationship with the USA than to end that relationship.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is that we don\u2019t know if they\u2019re even thinking of it because there\u2019s nobody at that level that has leveled with us.\n&gt; \n&gt; So what then?  Then the route would be to force that decision.  A thing that of course the colonial parties, bent on their electoral survival, don\u2019t wish to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am convinced that our diaspora is going to have to carry out this labor.\n\n**EDIT:** I should also add\u2014something that many English-language articles haven't been covering very well\u2014that the author has been doubling down on the antisemitic themes on Facebook posts since this op-ed was published (my rough translations):\n\n* [\"Dear Lord.

{"author": "jswilson99", "body": "I don't think there's a massive conspiracy involving every single Jew on the planet. However I do think Jews are very tribal and very nepotistic people. I think they will always put Jewish interests over the interests of their nation. I'm speaking in broad terms here, not every single individual Jew. I think it's quite clear that Jews have a lot of institutional power. I don't think that's deniable. Because of their massive influence in the media that will reflect how they view society and how they want things to work. Also they have massive influence in the banking industry, the same banking industry that finances massive wars and wrecks the lives of millions. Jews also have a lot of political power that explains why Netanyahu gets like 30 standing ovations in front of Congress as he encourages the United States citizens to send their sons and daughters to fight wars overseas.\n\nAs for the Holocaust I think there's ample amounts of evidence to show it didn't really happen. First of all I think this is the most damming evidence but there were probably hundreds of articles written well before Hitler came to power detailing how 6 million Jews were starving or 6 million Jews were dying. You can find that information easily. About the Nuremberg Trials I think you should look up what Historian David Irving has to say about this. It's quite evident that the Germans who spoke at the trials were brutally tortured and forced to say what the USA Britain Soviets wanted them to. Also there may be thousands of eyewitnesses but no Holocaust Denier I know doubts that people in the camps had it rough. Supply lines to the camps were cut off so many of the prisoners were starving and were suffering, it's just the existence of gas chambers that is questionable. \n\nI could go on all day with this but I hope I answered your question. I consider myself Alt-Right, but I hate no one, I want nobody to suffer or die. I just have my criticisms of Israel because of their support for the Yinon Plan and the Kalergi Plan, I think it's just harmful for whites to accept so much Jewish influence. Jews have been persecuted a lot by Europeans throughout history, that is true but people hardly look at the other side of the coin. I think it's best if we separate, our races, our cultures are incompatible over the long run I think it's best we separate and I don't want things to get violent or bad.

{"author": "1WHOSEEKS", "body": "And more because it was too long. \n&gt;But I believe that given this was a \"centuries-old plan,\" Joly had access to an earlier version, and hence the similarities.\nPhilip Graves' article smacks of a Zionist propaganda operation. Graves \"expose\" of Protocols appeared in August 1921 when Zionists were pressing the League of Nations to turn Palestine into a Jewish homeland under British Mandate. Philip Grave tells the unlikely story that a \"Mr. X \" brought Dialogues to him in Constantinople, where he was the Times' correspondent. Mr. X presented it as \"irrefutable proof\" that the Protocols are a plagiarism. Mr. X was a White Russian. Given the Jewish role in the Bolshevik Revolution, it seems incredible that a White Russian would help to discredit the Protocols. Grave claims Mr. X bought the book from, get this, \"a former member of the Okhrana\" who had fled to Constantinople. Are we supposed to believe the Okhrana used this very copy to \"plagiarize\" the Protocols?\n\n&gt;In \"The Controversy of Zion,\" (Chapter 34) Douglas Reed, a Times' staffer at the time, provides additional background. In May 1920, Lord Northcliffe, a part owner of \"The Times,\" printed an article about the Protocols entitled \"The Jewish Peril, A Disturbing Pamphlet, A Call for an Enquiry.\" It concluded: \"An impartial investigation of these would-be documents and their history is most desirable... are we to dismiss the whole matter without inquiry and to let the influence of such a book as this work go unchecked?\" This was part of a short-lived public realization, after the Bolshevik revolution, that Communism was Jewish in nature, and posed a genuine danger to Western civilization. Even Winston Churchill waded in with his famous article \"Zionism Vs. Bolshevism: A Struggle for the Soul of the Jewish People.\"\n\n&gt;Then in May 1922 Northcliffe visited Palestine and wrote that Britain had been too hasty to promise it to the Jews when in fact it belonged to 700,000 Muslim Arab residents. Mr. Wickham Steed, the editor of \"The Times\" in 1921 refused to print the article and Northcliffe tried to get him fired. Somehow, while Northcliffe was on vacation in Europe, Steed was able to have Northcliffe declared \"insane\" and forcibly committed. Later Northcliffe complained he was being poisoned and died suddenly in 1922. Douglas Reed was Northcliffe's secretary but didn't learn of these events until they appeared in the Official History of \"The Times\" in the 1950's. Clearly Northcliffe had offended some \"big boys\" when he championed the Protocols and opposed the\nBritish Mandate in Palestine.\n\n&gt;Philip Graves and other apologists are making exaggerated claims. They are incorrect to claim the Protocols plagiarize the Dialogues chapter by chapter. Graves writes that \"the Seventh Dialogue... corresponds with the fifth, sixth, seventh and part of the eighth Protocol.\" At eight pages, these Protocols are twice as long as the Seventh Dialogue. They mostly contain material not found in the Seventh Dialogue, or anywhere else. I will list a few examples from Protocol Five alone. Protocol Five says \"our kingdom will be distinguished by a despotism of such magnificent proportions\" that it will \"wipe out any goyim who oppose us by deed or word.\"\n\n&gt;In contrast Seventh Dialogue says, \"Death, expropriation and torture should only play a minor role in the internal politics of modern states.\" Protocols Five says we \"robbed [the goyim] of their faith in God\" and \"insinuated into their minds the conception of their own rights,\" thereby undermining the authority of Kings. There is nothing comparable in Dialogue Seven. Protocol Five says, \"we shall so wear down the goyim that they will be compelled to offer us international power [allowing us] gradually to absorb all State forces of the world and to form a Super-Government.\" There is nothing comparable in Dialogue Seven. Protocol Five says the \"engine\" of all states is \"in our hands\" and that engine is\n\"Gold.\" \"We were chosen by God Himself to rule over the whole earth.\" There is nothing comparable in Dialogue Seven.\n\n&gt;The author of Dialogues does select a few passages or references from Protocols that appear unaltered or in slightly different form. For example, the Dialogues' say: \"Everywhere might precedes right. Political liberty is merely a relative idea. The need to live is what dominates states as it does individuals.\" In Protocols this is, \"From the law of nature right lies in might. Political freedom is an idea but not a fact, and one must know how to use it [political freedom] as a bait whenever it appears necessary to attract the masses... to one's party for the purpose of crushing another who is in authority.\" (Protocols 1) Graves leaves out the last part to make the resemblance seem greater than it is. Dialogues (7) say, \"Revolutionary ferment which is suppressed in one's own country should be incited throughout Europe.\" In Protocols (7) \"Throughout all Europe...we must create ferments, discords, hostilities.\" There is no reference to suppressing these in one's own country.\n\n&gt;These similarities can be explained by the fact that the Protocols predated Joly and he was familiar with it.\nThe two hooks are different in tone and relevance. The Dialogue today seems academic and esoteric and requires an exegesis. It was a veiled attack on Napoleon III whose views Joly ascribes to Machiavelli. Ironically this is where he dips into the Protocols. Napoleon wasn't fooled and Joly was arrested. In contrast, the authenticity of the Protocols is self-evident to any informed individual with an open mind. They describe the world we live in.\n\n&gt;If your plan for World Domination leaked out, what would you do? Would you admit it? No, you'd employ an army of ciphers to stigmatize the document as a hoax motivated by \"prejudice\" and \"anti-Semitism.\" They have executed this \"damage control\" perfectly, a measure of their power to deceive even in the presence of the truth. This is the only Conspiracy that has prevailed in spite of the blueprint being freely available. It demonstrates the credulity (or venality) of the intelligentsia and the masses. The Illuminati (top-rung Masonic Jews and their non-Jewish allies) have distributed some wealth and power to the masses (liberalism, socialism) as a way of securing ultimate power for themselves. \n\n&gt;According to the Protocols, they will eventually withdraw these benefits once their \"invisible government\" is invincible. The \"war on terror\" should be seen in this context. In my view, \"Protocols Deniers\" are complicit in this Conspiracy, which is responsible for most human suffering and will lead to a great deal more. As a Jew, I don't want this responsibility on my head, or on other innocent Jews or Masons.\"\n", "score": 3, "subreddit": "conspiracy", "date_year_month": "2018-01", "created_utc_converted": "2018-01-23 01:01:58", "score_overall": 13, "words": "jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish goyim goyim goyim conspiracy illuminati jewish conspiracy jew", "shared_words": "jewish goyim conspiracy illuminati jew", "socre_distint": 5}

Here's the evidence:\n\n&gt;In her antagonism toward Israel, however, McKinney may be taking the Green Party further than it cares to go. In March of this year, she attended a conference in London on the Gaza crisis organized by a foundation established by Mahathir Mohamad, who was prime minister of Malaysia from 1981 to 2003 and has a long history of anti-Jewish rhetoric. **In a 1970 book, Mahathir wrote that \"Jewish stinginess and financial wizardry gained them financial control of Europe\" and that Jews \"are not merely hook-nosed, but understand money instinctively.\" In a 2003 speech at an international summit of Islamic leaders, he said: \"Today, the Jews rule the world by proxy. They get others to fight and die for them.** They invented socialism, communism, human rights and democracy to avoid persecution and gain \u2026 control of the most powerful countries.\"\n\n&gt;**McKinney commented about the London conference in two postings on the Green Party's website in which she praised Mahathir (\"one of my heroes\") and also a man named David Pidcock, whom she called \"my London friend.\"** A British-born convert to Islam, Pidcock is the author of an extensive collection of conspiracy-laden anti-Semitic works, including the 1992 work **Satanic Voices Ancient &amp; Modern, which blames most of the world's current and ancient problems on a centuries-old conspiracy whose participants include Freemasons, Illuminati, \"Luciferian Zionists,\" the Rockefeller family, big oil companies and the Council on Foreign Relations**. The principal Internet outlet for Pidcock's writings is the website iamthewitness.com, which is **devoted to fascist and anti-Semitic writings, prominently featuring The International Jew published by Henry Ford.**\n\n&gt;At the conference, **McKinney was photographed with Pidcock and Michele Renouf, a former model and socialite who is considered one of Britain's leading Holocaust-denial activists.**\n\n&gt;On April 20, McKinney posted another commentary on the Green Party site, this time focusing on the international economy. The essay essentially accused financier George Soros and former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan (both of whom are Jewish) of participating in a plot to destabilize the world economy to pave the way for \"one-world government.\" **She used a term from a writer named Matthias Chang to describe the principals of this conspiracy \u2014 \"the Shadow Money-Lenders\" \u2014 that also is the title of Chang's latest book. She praised the book and quoted from it extensively.**\n\n&gt;Matthias Chang is a Malaysian lawyer, a Catholic of Chinese ancestry, who served as an adviser to former Prime Minister Mahathir and remains his close associate. **In The Shadow Money-Lenders, Chang avoids the rhetorical excesses of the less subtle Jew-haters. But his description of the financial conspiracy is well salted with names of various Jewish bankers past and present** (Kuhn, Loeb, Warburg, and so on). Chang's sentiments were clearer in 2006, when he submitted remarks to be read to a \"Free Speech\" conference in Washington, D.C., organized jointly by The Barnes Review and American Free Press.\n\n&gt;**The Barnes Review, whose website homepage promotes Chang's books, is a journal specializing in Holocaust denial started in 1994 by long-time white supremacist and anti-Semite Willis Carto**; the American Free Press, which began publishing in 2001, was also started by Carto and specializes in anti-Semitic material and conspiracy theories. Chang was unable to attend in person, so his remarks were read by Michael Collins Piper, a writer and contributor to the American Free Press whose main claim to fame is his theory that Israeli spies were behind the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\n&gt;Chang's remarks, which are posted on his website, included a shout-out to a remarkable group of haters, Holocaust deniers and conspiracy theorists: \"American Free Press, The Barnes Review, The Spotlight, and the truth seekers that I have long admired, Harry Elmer Barnes, Willis Carto, Michael Collins Piper, Christopher Petherick [and] Eustace Mullins (whose life-long persecution by the Police State is a disgrace to the Constitution).\" Some of those names are more familiar than others, but take Mullins, for example. **Among his writings over the years are declarations that Jews are literally descended from Satan and that they \"drink the blood of an innocent gentile child\" in religious ceremonies.**\n\n\n\n\n", "score": 0, "subreddit": "WayOfTheBern", "date_year_month": "2018-01", "created_utc_converted": "2018-01-23 07:22:35", "score_overall": 19, "words": "jewish jewish holocaust jewish jewish conspiracy conspiracy illuminati jew holocaust jewish conspiracy jew conspiracy jewish holocaust conspiracy holocaust conspiracy", "shared_words": "jewish holocaust conspiracy illuminati jew", "socre_distint": 5}
{"author": "Berenteb", "body": "George Friedman Hungarian-Jewish descent, geopolitical forecaster, strategist, international affairs  on Horthy: \n\n&gt;Adm. Miklos Horthy, a regent to a non-existent king and an admiral in the forgotten Austro-Hungarian navy, governed Hungary between 1920 and 1944. Horthy ruled a country that was small and weak. Its population was 9.3 million in 1940. Horthy's goal was to preserve its sovereignty in the face of the rising power of Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin. Caught between the two \u2014 and by this I mean that both prized Hungary for its strategic position in the Carpathian Basin \u2014 Hungary had few options. Horthy's strategy was to give what he must and as little as he had to in order to retain Hungary's sovereignty. Over time, he had to give more and more as the Germans became more desperate and as the Soviets drew nearer. He did not surrender his room to maneuver; it was taken from him. His experience is one that Hungary's current leadership appears to have studied.\n\n&gt;Horthy's strategy meant a great deal to the Jews. He was likely no more anti-Semitic than any member of his class had to be. He might not hire a Jew, but he wasn't going to kill one. This was different from the new style of anti-Semitism introduced by Hitler, which required mass murder. A sneer would no longer do. In Poland and in other countries under German sway, the mass killings started early. In Hungary, Horthy's policy kept them at bay. Not perfectly, of course. Thousands were killed early on, and anti-Jewish laws were passed. But thousands are not hundreds of thousands or millions, and in that time and place it was a huge distinction. Hungary did not join Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union until months after it had started, and Jews, including my father and uncles, were organized in labor battalions, where casualties were appalling. But their wives and children remained home, had food and lived. Horthy conceded no more than he had to, but what he had to do he did. Some say it was opportunism, others mere cowardice of chance. Whatever it was, while it lasted, Hungary was not like Poland or even France. The Jews were not handed over to the Germans.\n\n&gt;Horthy fell from his tightrope on March 19, 1944. Realizing Germany was losing the war, Horthy made peace overtures to the Soviets. They were coming anyway, so he might as well welcome them. Hitler, of course, discovered this and occupied Hungary, which was essential to the defense of Austria. In a complex maneuver involving kidnapping and blackmail \u2014 even kidnapping one of Horthy's sons \u2014 Hitler forced the Hungarian leader to form a new government consisting of Hungary's homegrown Nazis, the Arrow Cross Party. As with Vidkun Quisling in Norway and Philippe Petain in France, Hitler installed his eager puppets.\n\n&gt;Horthy signed off on this. But that signature, as he pointed out, was meaningless. The Germans were there, they could do as they wanted, and his signature was a meaningless act that spared his sons' lives. My father said he understood him. He had no more power, except saving his sons. Without the power to control events, saving those lives cost nothing and gained something precious. In no way did it change what was going to happen during the next year in Hungary: the murder of more than half a million Jews and a bloodbath throughout the country as Soviet forces advanced and surrounded Budapest and as the Germans fought to their deaths.\n\n&gt;My parents were grateful to Horthy. For them, without him, the Holocaust would have come to Hungary years earlier. He did not crush the Hungarian Nazis, but he kept them at bay. He did not turn on Hitler, but he kept him at bay. What Horthy did was the dirty work of decency. He made deals with devils to keep the worst things from happening. By March 1944, Horthy could no longer play the game. Hitler had ended it. His choice was between dead sons and the horror of the following year, or living sons and that same horror. From my parents' view, there was nothing more he could do, so he saved his sons. They believed Horthy's critics were unable to comprehend the choices he had.\n\n&gt;It was the Germans they blamed for what happened. Hungarian fascists cooperated enthusiastically in the killings, but Horthy had been able to control them to some extent before the German occupation. Hungary had a strong anti-Semitic strain but not so strong it could sweep Horthy from power. Once the Wehrmacht, the SS and Adolf Eichmann, the chief organizer of the Holocaust, were in Budapest, they found the Arrow Cross Party to be populated by eager collaborators.\n\n\nhttps://worldview.stratfor.com/article/borderlands-hungary-maneuvers", "score": 5, "subreddit": "europe", "date_year_month": "2018-01", "created_utc_converted": "2018-01-25 11:27:16", "score_overall": 6, "words": "jewish jew jewish cowardice holocaust holocaust", "shared_words": "jewish jew cowardice holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "Merkwuurdigliebe", "body": "Great questions - as for knowing when the time would have come, so to speak, I think it\u2019s tough to say... I know they took a pretty exhaustive census in the years leading up to the holocaust, which was how they came to have such detailed numbers of Jewish populations in occupied countries. I\u2019m sure they couldn\u2019t be perfectly precise, but in spirit, the idea was to eliminate each Jew. The Nazis were meticulous bureaucrats... they kept detailed records of prisoners and their fates at the camps. In theory, they could measure the numbers killed at the camps up against those obtained in the aforementioned census of Jews and others, and use these figures as a measure of progress.\n\nIn the transcripts of the meeting at the Wannsee conference, (where a handful of very high ranking party and military figures hashed out a lot of the details around the implementation of Operation Reinhard, which involved extermination camps in the east like Treblinka and Sobib\u00f3r), they discuss this issue and a few hard figures are mentioned.

{"author": "Aoteamerica", "body": "Actually, there is 10 stages:\n\nhttp://genocidewatch.org/genocide/tenstagesofgenocide.html\n\nGenocide is a process that develops in ten stages that are predictable but not inexorable. At each stage, preventive measures can stop it. The process is not linear. Stages may occur simultaneously. Logically, later stages must be preceded by earlier stages.  But all stages continue to operate throughout the process.\n\n**1. CLASSIFICATION**: All cultures have categories to distinguish people into \u201cus and them\u201d by ethnicity, race, religion, or nationality: German and Jew, Hutu and Tutsi. Bipolar societies that lack mixed categories, such as Rwanda and Burundi, are the most likely to have genocide. The main preventive measure at this early stage is to develop universalistic institutions that transcend ethnic or racial divisions, that actively promote tolerance and understanding, and that promote classifications that transcend the divisions. The Catholic church could have played this role in Rwanda, had it not been riven by the same ethnic cleavages as Rwandan society. Promotion of a common language in countries like Tanzania has also promoted transcendent national identity. This search for common ground is vital to early prevention of genocide.\n\n**2. SYMBOLIZATION**: We give names or other symbols to the classifications. We name people \u201cJews\u201d or \u201cGypsies\u201d, or distinguish them by colors or dress; and apply the symbols to members of groups. Classification and symbolization are universally human and do not necessarily result in genocide unless they lead to  dehumanization. When combined with hatred, symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of pariah groups: the yellow star for Jews under Nazi rule, the blue scarf for people from the Eastern Zone in Khmer Rouge Cambodia. To combat symbolization, hate symbols can be legally forbidden (swastikas) as can hate speech. Group marking like gang clothing or tribal scarring can be outlawed, as well. The problem is that legal limitations will fail if unsupported by popular cultural enforcement. Though Hutu and Tutsi were forbidden words in Burundi until the 1980\u2019s, code words replaced them. If widely supported, however, denial of symbolization can be powerful, as it was in Bulgaria, where the government refused to supply enough yellow badges and at least eighty percent of Jews did not wear them, depriving the yellow star of its significance as a Nazi symbol for Jews.\n\n**3. DISCRIMINATION**: A dominant group uses law, custom, and political power to deny the rights of other groups.  The powerless group may not be accorded full civil rights or even citizenship. Examples include the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 in Nazi Germany, which stripped Jews of their German citizenship, and prohibited their employment by the government and by universities.  Denial of citizenship to the Rohingya Muslim minority in Burma is another example.  Prevention against discrimination means full political empowerment and citizenship rights for all groups in a society.  Discrimination on the basis of nationality, ethnicity, race or religion should be outlawed.  Individuals should have the right to sue the state, corporations, and other individuals if their rights are violated.\n\n**4. DEHUMANIZATION**: One group denies the humanity of the other group. Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects or diseases. Dehumanization overcomes the normal human revulsion against murder. At this stage, hate propaganda in print and on hate radios is used to vilify the victim group. In combating this dehumanization, incitement to genocide should not be confused with protected speech. Genocidal societies lack constitutional protection for countervailing speech, and should be treated differently than democracies. Local and international leaders should condemn the use of hate speech and make it culturally unacceptable. Leaders who incite genocide should be banned from international travel and have their foreign finances frozen. Hate radio stations should be shut down, and hate propaganda banned. Hate crimes and atrocities should be promptly punished.\n\n**5. ORGANIZATION**: Genocide is always organized, usually by the state, often using militias to provide deniability of state responsibility (the Janjaweed in Darfur.) Sometimes organization is informal (Hindu mobs led by local RSS militants) or decentralized (terrorist groups.) Special army units or militias are often trained and armed. Plans are made for genocidal killings. To combat this stage, membership in these militias should be outlawed. Their leaders should be denied visas for foreign travel. The U.N. should impose arms embargoes on governments and citizens of countries involved in genocidal massacres, and create commissions to investigate violations, as was done in post-genocide Rwanda.\n\n**6. POLARIZATION**: Extremists drive the groups apart. Hate groups broadcast polarizing propaganda. Laws may forbid intermarriage or social interaction. Extremist terrorism targets moderates, intimidating and silencing the center. Moderates from the perpetrators\u2019 own group are most able to stop genocide, so are the first to be arrested and killed. Prevention may mean security protection for moderate leaders or assistance to human rights groups. Assets of extremists may be seized, and visas for international travel denied to them. Coups d\u2019\u00e9tat by extremists should be opposed by international sanctions.\n\n**7.  PREPARATION**:  National or perpetrator group leaders plan the \u201cFinal Solution\u201d to the Jewish, Armenian, Tutsi or other targeted group \u201cquestion.\u201d  They often use euphemisms to cloak their intentions, such as referring to their goals as \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d \u201cpurification,\u201d or \u201ccounter-terrorism.\u201d  They build armies, buy weapons and train their troops and militias.  They indoctrinate the populace with fear of the victim group.  Leaders often claim that \u201cif we don\u2019t kill them, they will kill us.\u201d  Prevention of preparation may include arms embargos and commissions to enforce them.  It should include prosecution of incitement and conspiracy to commit genocide, both crimes under Article 3 of the Genocide Convention.\n\n**(DE-COLONISATION)**\n\n**8. PERSECUTION**: Victims are identified and separated out because of their ethnic or religious identity. Death lists are drawn up. In state sponsored genocide, members of victim groups may be forced to wear identifying symbols. Their property is often expropriated. Sometimes they are even segregated into ghettoes, deported into concentration camps, or confined to a famine-struck region and starved.  Genocidal massacres begin.  They are acts of genocide because they intentionally destroy part of a group.  At this stage, a Genocide Emergency must be declared. If the political will of the great powers, regional alliances, or the U.N. Security Council can be mobilized, armed international intervention should be prepared, or heavy assistance provided to the victim group to prepare for its self-defense. Humanitarian assistance should be organized by the U.N. and private relief groups for the inevitable tide of refugees to come.\n\n**9. EXTERMINATION** begins, and quickly becomes the mass killing legally called \u201cgenocide.\u201d It is \u201cextermination\u201d to the killers because they do not believe their victims to be fully human. When it is sponsored by the state, the armed forces often work with militias to do the killing. Sometimes the genocide results in revenge killings by groups against each other, creating the downward whirlpool-like cycle of bilateral genocide (as in Burundi). At this stage, only rapid and overwhelming armed intervention can stop genocide. Real safe areas or refugee escape corridors should be established with heavily armed international protection. (An unsafe \u201csafe\u201d area is worse than none at all.) The U.N. Standing High Readiness Brigade, EU Rapid Response Force, or regional forces -- should be authorized to act by the U.N. Security Council if the genocide is small. For larger interventions, a multilateral force authorized by the U.N. should intervene. If the U.N. is paralyzed, regional alliances must act. It is time to recognize that the international responsibility to protect transcends the narrow interests of individual nation states. If strong nations will not provide troops to intervene directly, they should provide the airlift, equipment, and financial means necessary for regional states to intervene.\n\n**10. DENIAL** is the final stage that lasts throughout and always follows a genocide. It is among the surest indicators of further genocidal massacres. The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves, burn the bodies, try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses. They deny that they committed any crimes, and often blame what happened on the victims. They block investigations of the crimes, and continue to govern until driven from power by force, when they flee into exile. There they remain with impunity, like Pol Pot or Idi Amin, unless they are captured and a tribunal is established to try them. The response to denial is punishment by an international tribunal or national courts. There the evidence can be heard, and the perpetrators punished. Tribunals like the Yugoslav or Rwanda Tribunals, or an international tribunal to try the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, or an International Criminal Court may not deter the worst genocidal killers. But with the political will to arrest and prosecute them, some may be brought to justice.\n\n\u00a9 2013 Gregory H. Stanton.

There is a nation that regards as its eternal enemies all other peoples of this planet, and whose attitude toward even its nominal allies and greatest benefactors is one of total mistrust to the extent that it continually deceives them. It is a nation which even has a special name for all outsiders, for all Gentiles, for all goyim, for all non-Jews. In their own religious writings, Jews even boast of their superiority over the goyim, which they compare to cattle. Cattle, of course, must be herded, and one of the best ways to herd them is to convince them that they ought to go in the direction that their owners desire. Force can be used as a last resort, of course, but if one can convince the dumb brutes that the slaughterhouse is really paradise, then they'll gallop over there with much less trouble. \n\nJewish humor seems universal in this decadent age. It is Jewish humor that dominates our mass media, and perhaps almost all popular humor these days is Jewish humor in the sense that if it not actually written by Jews then it is based on Jewish examples and shares in the Jewish spirit. But there is another Jewish humor, a Jewish humor not intended for gentile eyes, which is found in sources intended to be read only by Jews. In these private jokes, recurrent themes are the intellectual superiority of the Jew, the gullibility of White people and how easily we can be fooled by Jewish deception. As such, Jewish humor is very revealing. One such joke runs as follows:\nOn a train in czarist Russia, a Jew is eating a whitefish, wrapped in paper. A Gentile, sitting across the aisle, begins to taunt him with various anti-Semitic epithets. Finally, he asks the Jew, \"What makes you Jews so smart?\" \"All right,\" replies the Jew, \"I guess I'll have to tell you. It's because we eat the head of the whitefish.\" \"Well, if that's the secret,\" says the Gentile, \"then I can be as smart as you are.\" \"That's right,\" says the Jew, \"And in fact, I happen to have an extra whitefish head with me. You can have it for five kopecks.\" The Gentile pays for the fish head and begins to eat. An hour later the train stops at a station for a few minutes. The Gentile leaves the train and comes back. 'Listen, Jew,\" he says, \"You sold me that whitefish head for five kopecks. But I just saw a whole whitefish at the market for three kopecks.\" \"See,\" replies the Jew, \"You're getting smarter already.\"\nJewish psychoanalyst Theodore Reik, in his book Jewish Wit which deals with subliminal psychological meanings of Jewish humor, admits the existence of this Jewish contempt for the easily-fooled non-Jew when he notes: \n\nAll kinds of deception and cunning, of fraud and trickery, devised and committed by Jews, either to get money or to avoid paying money, are exposed and candidly revealed by Jewish jokes.\n\nOf course, Reik and the Jewish joke-tellers are wrong if they limit the extent of Jewish lies to tricks that get them money. Far more important than a few kopecks or a few million dollars are the Jewish lies which garner them sympathy and reverence. Yes, I said reverence. For the key to understanding the most dangerous Jewish lies is this: Jews lie to gain sympathy and reverence -- the ideas that they want to plant in our minds are that Jews are terribly persecuted and that Jews are especially holy. \n\nTo someone whose eyes are open, the constantly-repeated mantra that the Jews are a persecuted people, a tiny powerless minority deserving of our help and deepest sympathy, is an insanely absurd idea. In reality, the Jews are undoubtedly the most powerful race on this planet. As I showed last week on this program, they are probably the fourth largest nuclear power on Earth via their \"home base,\" Israel, and through their extremely influential positions in the media and financial institutions of the West, they have effective control of our political system and the armed might of the most powerful nations in the world, particularly via their control of the one remaining superpower, the United States. In the West, virtually no news is broadcast, virtually no feature film is made, virtually no newspaper article is printed which has not first passed the gauntlet of Jewish approval. \n\nDespite this massive power, the Jews paradoxically portray themselves as \"persecuted,\" and a large amount of their deception and lying efforts are concentrated on maintaining that impression among their subjects. \n\nIn the last half-century, the Jews have concentrated on telling lies about how much they were oppressed and how many of them died in the Second World War, and stories of their sufferings at the hands of the Germans in that war are omnipresent in their periodicals and on their television networks. Ask a schoolchild or your neighbor how many Americans or Frenchmen died in the Second World War, and your answer will be a blank stare or a shrug of the shoulders. But ask about how many Jews died, and the magical number \"six million\" will spring to the lips of even the dullest. The media bosses have done their job very well. The Jews' catch phrase about what they refer to as the \"Holocaust\" is \"never forgive -- never forget\" and of course it is they who will never forgive Europeans for the unspeakable crime of wanting nations without Jewish supervisors; and it is we who must never forget the lesson that to question the Jews' right to own our television networks and control our financial and political system is morally equivalent to -- and literally leads to -- throwing innocent Jewish grandmothers into gas chambers. Do you see how the idea that the richest and most powerful clan on Earth is somehow poor and oppressed checkmates any opposition and gives the Jews even more power? \n\nBut one weakness that the Jews have is that very contempt for our intelligence, their faith in our infinite gullibility. This weakness leads the Jews to be careless in their lies at times. And that carelessness opens the door to doubt and to reason. This Jewish carelessness causes them to lie in hilariously absurd and contradictory ways. Let's look at one such lie, one of their \"Holocaust\" lies which they told during the Second World War. As you will see, they can't keep their story straight. \n\nIn Zurich in 1944, a Jew named Stefan Szende published a book entitled Der letzte Jude aus Polen which was translated into English under the title The Promise Hitler Kept, published by Roy Publishers in New York. I quote Szende's claims regarding Jewish deaths at the Belzec concentration camp:\nThe trains coming into Belzec loaded with Jews were driven into a tunnel in the underground premises of the execution building.... Everything was taken away from them. The goods seized in this way were carefully sorted out, listed and ticketed and subsequently used for the benefit of the master race. It was to spare the staff at Belzec this tremendous task, which, of course, hindered them in their real job, that later on all Jews were sent to Belzec naked. \n\nWhen trainloads of naked Jews arrived they were herded into a great hall capable of holding several thousand people. This hall had no windows and its floor was of metal. Once the Jews were all inside, the floor of this hall sank like a lift into a great tank of water which lay below it until the Jews were up to their waists in water. Then a powerful electrical current was sent into the metal flooring and within a few seconds all the Jews, thousands at a time, were dead. \n\nThe metal flooring then rose again and the water drained away. The corpses of the slaughtered Jews were now heaped all over the floor. A different current was then switched on and the metal flooring rapidly became red hot, so that the corpses were incinerated as in a crematorium and only ash was left. \nThe floor was then tipped up and the ashes slid out into prepared receptacles. The smoke of the process was carried away by great factory chimneys. \n\nThat was the whole procedure. As soon as it was completed, it could start up again. New batches of Jews were constantly being driven into the tunnels. The individual trains brought between 3,000 and 5,000 Jews at a time, and there were days on which the Belzec line saw between twenty and thirty such trains arrive.\" \nNow, electrical engineers will be amazed at a \"powerful electrical current\" that does not obey the normal laws of physics, but then, since Jews don't lie, we must believe that the evil Germans did develop it and use their amazing discovery only at Belzec in a gigantic facility which was never found or seen by anyone. \n\nFuneral directors will be intrigued by the other magical \"electrical current\" created by the Germans which can incinerate not just one body (which can take over two hours in the most modern crematoria) but thousands of bodies in a few moments.

{"author": "baebaebokchoy", "body": "\nHoward Zinn: Israel was a \u201cMistake.\u201d\n\nThe March/April 2010 issue of Moment magazine features a final interview with Howard Zinn, the counter-historian whose People\u2019s History of the United States has become a bible of the campus Left.\n\nZinn died last January at the age of 87 in Santa Monica. As we reported then:\n\nHoward Zinn, an American Jewish historian who wrote the \u201cPeople\u2019s History of the United States,\u201d has died.\n\nZinn, whose best-seller helped establish him as a central figure of the American left, died of a heart attack Wednesday in California. He was 87.\n\nAlong with another Boston-based American Jewish professor, Noam Chomsky, Zinn was a leading left-wing intellectual. His \u201cPeople\u2019s History,\u201d published in 1980, accused Christopher Columbus of genocide while venerating labor leaders and war opponents.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made an amazing contribution to American intellectual and moral culture,\u201d Chomsky said, according to the Boston Globe. \u201cHe\u2019s changed the conscience of America in a highly constructive way. I really can\u2019t think of anyone I can compare him to in this respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s History\u201d inspired a documentary in 2009 on the History Channel titled \u201cThe People Speak.\u201d Zinn narrated the documentary, which highlighted those who spoke up for social change.\n\nZinn, a New York City native and the son of Jewish immigrants, wrote several books and three plays. His last essay, about President Obama\u2019s first year in office, was published last week in The Nation.\n\nHe flew missions throughout Europe during World War II.\n\nI\u2019ve never read an extensive interview with Zinn about his Jewishness and his views on Israel, and writer Jeremy Gillick does an excellent job drawing him out, if not exactly challenging him.\n\nThe opening questions give Zinn a chance to reflect on his family, his upbringing in a Yiddish-speaking home, and his parents\u2019 lack of strong political views:\n\nWhat was your Jewish upbringing like? \nMy parents were not very religious. They observed the big holidays\u2014Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Passover\u2014and they kept a kosher household. They spoke Yiddish to one another and English to us, but there was enough Yiddish spoken so that even now I can pretty much understand it. I went to Hebrew school to study for my bar mitzvah and endured it, unenthusiastically. When my bar mitzvah was over, that was the end of my religious activity.\n\nWas your family political? \nNot at all. My parents were working people concentrating on survival. The only extent to which they were political is that they were aware about Hitler, Nazism and anti-Semitism, and Roosevelt and the New Deal, since poor people understood that Roosevelt was helping them in some way. Sometimes people ask me how my Jewishness has affected my radical political beliefs, and I say \u201cslightly.\u201d My radical political beliefs come from many sources. But you can\u2019t say being a Jew has absolutely no effect on your thinking.\n\nDid you ever experience anti-Semitism? \nI knew anti-Semitism existed and that sometimes people looked upon jewish people in a different way, but I never experienced anything overt. I suppose a lot of it had to do with living in a Jewish neighborhood. Before I went into the military I spent three years working in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where I was a little more aware of being Jewish because the shipbuilding industry had few jewish people. It wasn\u2019t like the garment industry. There was not overt anti-Semitism, but I knew that the German guy I worked with was conscious of the fact that I was Jewish.\n\nThen Zinn answers questions about Israel itself, which he calls, in retrospect, a mistake.\n\nHow did you react to Israel\u2019s creation in 1948? \nI didn\u2019t know a lot about it, but I remember speaking at some gathering to celebrate its founding. I wasn\u2019t a Zionist. I just vaguely knew that a Jewish state was being created and that seemed like a good thing. I had no idea that the jewish people were coming into an area occupied by Palestinians.\n\nWere you critical of Israel before 1967? \nBefore 1967 Israel did not loom large in my consciousness. I was aware that there was a war between Israel and the Arab states in 1956, but it really wasn\u2019t until 1967 and the taking of the occupied territories that I realized this was a serious problem. I remember reading I.F. Stone, who was very concerned with Israel.\n\nHow do you discuss Israel and Palestine with jewish people who might be resistant to claims that Israel bears some responsibility for the conflict? \nAs always in very complicated issues where emotions come to the fore quickly, I try to first acknowledge the other party\u2019s feelings. In the case of Israel I try to say, yes, I understand your sympathy for a Jewish state, and I understand that you become angry when rockets fall [in Sderot] or when a suicide bomber takes needless life. But that has to be seen in proportion. I try to appeal to the experience of jewish people, the experience of the Holocaust, by saying, if it\u2019s never again, it\u2019s not just never again for jewish people, it\u2019s never again for anybody. I also try to present facts that are hard to put aside. Rockets from Gaza killed three Israelis; Israelis retaliated with an enormous bombardment that killed 1,000 people. You can\u2019t simply write that off or say, well, they\u2019re morally equivalent or it was bad on both sides. Or the Lebanese send rockets into Israel, killing a number of people, and the Israelis invade Lebanon in 1982 and there are 14,000 civilian casualties. These are horrors inflicted by a Jewish state. As a Jew I feel ashamed when I read these things\u2026I [also] try to appeal to what I think are the best legacies of the Jewish people\u2014people like Albert Einstein and Martin Buber, who cannot be simply written off, because they\u2019re Jewish heroes. And these are people who were critical of Israel and sympathetic to Palestinians.\n\nDo you think that Zionism was a mistake? \nI think the Jewish State was a mistake, yes. Obviously, it\u2019s too late to go back. It was a mistake to drive the Indians off the American continent, but it\u2019s too late to give it back. At the time, I thought creating Israel was a good thing, but in retrospect, it was probably the worst thing that the jewish people could have done. What they did was join the nationalistic frenzy, they became privy to all of the evils that nationalism creates and became very much like the United States\u2014very aggressive, violent and bigoted. When jewish people were without a state they were internationalists and they contributed to whatever culture they were part of and produced great things. jewish people were known as kindly, talented people. Now, I think, Israel is contributing to anti-Semitism. So I think it was a big mistake.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that for all his radical and debatable analysis\u2014ignoring a hundred years of PRE-war Zionism and settlement, for instance\u2014Zinn arrives at a conclusion that Netanyahu and most mainstream Zionists and Palestinians putatively share\u2014a two state solution. \n\nWhat sort of solution do you want to see when it comes to the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? \nIdeally, there should be a secular state in which Arabs and jewish people live together as equals. There are countries around the world where different ethnic groups live side by side. But that is very difficult and therefore the two-state solution seems like the most practical thing, especially since both jewish people and Palestinians seem to favor it. It\u2019s odd: All these people on both sides want a two-state solution, but it can\u2019t come into being. The basic problem is the fanaticism of people like Benjamin Netanyahu and people who don\u2019t want to give up the occupied territories. The settlements also pose a real problem. But it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s solvable. It was solved in the agreement with Egypt [when the settlers were removed from Sinai]. This time it\u2019s more serious, but there are ways in which settlers can be compensated or assured of their rights in a Palestinian state as a quid pro quo for the rights of Arabs in the Jewish state.\n\nThis differs from the one-state solution many on the Left are now promoting, and shows an acceptance of Israel\u2019s legitimacy that many on the Left now refuse to acknowledge.

A national movement to prevent the Jews from kosher slaughter of animals, with animal rights as the stated motivation, was also organized.[117] Violence was also frequently aimed at Jewish stores, and many of them were looted. At the same time, persistent economic boycotts and harassment, including property-destroying riots, combined with the effects of the Great Depression that had been very severe on agricultural countries like Poland, reduced the standard of living of Poles and Polish Jews alike to the extent that by the end of the 1930s, a substantial portion of Polish Jews lived in grinding poverty.[118] As a result, on the eve of the Second World War, the Jewish community in Poland was large and vibrant internally, yet (with the exception of a few professionals) also substantially poorer and less integrated than the Jews in most of Western Europe.[citation needed]\n\n&gt; The main strain of antisemitism in Poland during this time was motivated by Catholic religious beliefs and centuries-old myths such as the blood libel. This religious-based antisemitism was sometimes joined with an ultra-nationalistic stereotype of Jews as disloyal to the Polish nation.[119] On the eve of World War II, many typical Polish Christians believed that there were far too many Jews in the country and the Polish government became increasingly concerned with the \"Jewish Question\". Some politicians were in favor of mass Jewish emigration from Poland.\n\n&gt; By the time of the German invasion in 1939, antisemitism was escalating, and hostility towards Jews was a mainstay of the right-wing political forces post-Pi\u0142sudski regime and also the Catholic Church. Discrimination and violence against Jews had rendered the Polish Jewish population increasingly destitute, as was the case throughout much of Central and Eastern Europe. Despite the impending threat to the Polish Republic from Nazi Germany, there was little effort seen in the way of reconciliation with Poland's Jewish population. In July 1939 the pro-government Gazeta Polska wrote, \"The fact that our relations with the Reich are worsening does not in the least deactivate our program in the Jewish question\u2014there is not and cannot be any common ground between our internal Jewish problem and Poland's relations with the Hitlerite Reich.\"[120][121] Escalating hostility towards Polish Jews and an official Polish government desire to remove Jews from Poland continued until the German invasion of Poland.[122]\n\n.\n\n&gt; and punished BY DEATH those who gave away Jews to Nazis or collaborated in killing them. \n\nBullshit, many Poles stole Jewish property, e.g. their houses, and never returned it. People were mainly executed for working with the Nazi. \n\n\nYour comment is the perfect example for disgusting revision.\n\n&gt;  you can't deny is that they were NOT collaborating with Nazis in exterminating Jews. \n\nStraight up holocaust denial right there....

{"author": "Carthagefield", "body": "That's one popular conspiracy theory sure. The reality though is somewhat less romantic. For all intents and purposes, Israel and Zionism has its roots in 19th century Eastern Europe, or rather Russia to be more specific. In 1880, around 75% of the world's Jews lived in a place called the [Pale of Settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_of_Settlement), an area that encompassed large swathes of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Western Russia. It was created by Catherine the Great in 1791 as a sort of ethnic enclave (perhaps most analogous, ironically, to the Palestinian West Bank), where Russia's Jews were to be confined to one region.\n\nUnder the Russian Tsars, life for Jews of the Pale was extremely harsh and poverty-stricken. Besides curtailing their freedom of movement, a quota system was put in place that either restricted or completely abolished their participation in education, professional occupations and voting, amongst numerous other disabilities.\n\nTensions between the Jews and the Russian authorities were often strained, but things abruptly came to a head following the assassination in 1881 of Tsar Alexander II, after a false rumour spread that Jews were behind the plot. The resulting pogroms throughout much of Eastern Europe precipitated the largest mass migration of Jews since Rome routed Judea. From then until the outbreak of WWII, a monumental demographic shift of Jewry from the Eastern Hemisphere to the West ensued.\n\nThe majority of Jewish emigrants (about 4.5 million between 1881 and 1930) settled in America, with many others moving to Austria, Germany, France and Holland. Britain, which had previously had only a small Jewish population of around thirty thousand, absorbed some 150,000 refugees between 1881 and 1920, which led to an enormous public backlash against this \"alien invasion\". The trade unions in particular were extremely opposed to immigration, as these mostly impoverished Russian Jews were undercutting British workers with their cheap labour. The Trades Union Congress passed a number of resolutions between 1892 and 1895 calling for strict anti-alien legislation. As a result, the Conservative party made immigration control a central plank of its political platform during the 1900 general election. \n\nAfter they were duly elected that year, in 1903 the Conservative government made their first proposal to create a \"Home for the Jews\" in a region of Uganda, Africa, which the recently formed Jewish Zionist movement in Austria rejected. In 1905, a British act of Parliament known as the [Aliens Act 1905](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_Act_1905) was created which sought to restrict Jewish immigration into Britain. The man responsible for this legislation was none other than Arthur Balfour, who would later give his name to the Balfour Declaration.\n\nThe Balfour Declaration of 1917 was an offer by the British to allow Jews to settle in Palestine, parts of which had recently been captured from the Ottomans during WWI. This time the Zionists gladly accepted. After the Ottoman Empire collapsed at the end of the war, the British administered the region for next 30 years under a League of Nations mandate known as [Mandatory Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine).\n\nIn 1939, after the breakdown of talks between Jewish and Arab delegates at the [London Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Conference_(1939\\)) regarding the future governance of Palestine, the British imposed the [White Paper of 1939](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper_of_1939), which effectively rescinded the Balfour declaration and the terms of the League of Nations Mandate. The White Paper rejected the concept of partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, as set out by the League of Nations, and announced that the country would instead be turned into a binational state with an Arab majority. It also severely curtailed Jewish immigration, allowing for only 75,000 Jews to migrate to Palestine from 1940 to 1944. Afterwards, further Jewish immigration would depend on consent of the Arab majority, and sales of Arab land to Jews was restricted.\n\nZionist groups in Palestine immediately rejected the White Paper and began a [campaign of attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_insurgency_in_Palestine) on government property and Arab civilians which lasted for several months. In May 1939 a Jewish labour strike was called in protest.\n\nWhen in December 1942 the mass murder of European Jewry became known to the Allies, the British continued to refuse to change their policy of limited immigration, or to admit Jews from Nazi controlled Europe in numbers outside the quota imposed by the White paper. To enforce this, the Royal Navy actively blockaded ships with Jewish refugees, preventing them from reaching Palestine.\n\nPost war from 1945 to 1948, more than 80,000 illegal Jewish immigrants attempted to enter Palestine. Some 49 immigrant ships were seized and 66,000 people were detained, with 1,600 others drowned at sea. Having known for some time that they would be unable to contain Jewish immigration, the British established internment camps on the island of Cyprus to detain all illegal immigrants. More than 50,000 Jews, mostly Holocaust survivors, passed though these camps.\n\nIn 1945, Lehi, Haganah and other independence groups formed the \"Jewish Resistance Movement\", an underground anti-British network, and set about a campaign of bombings and terrorist activities against the British occupation. The insurgency was coupled with a local and international propaganda campaign to gain sympathy abroad. Yishuv publicised the plight of Holocaust survivors and British attempts to stop them from migrating to Palestine, hoping to generate negative publicity against Britain around the world.\n\nDavid Ben-Gurion, the future Israeli Prime Minister, publicly stated that the Jewish insurgency was \"nourished by despair\", that Britain had \"proclaimed war against Zionism\", and that British policy was \"to liquidate the Jews as a people\". Of particular significance was the British interceptions of ships carrying Jewish immigrants. After the [SS Exodus incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Exodus), which became a major media event, propaganda against the British over their treatment of the refugee passengers was disseminated around the world, including claims that the Exodus was a \"floating Auschwitz\". In one incident, after a baby died at sea aboard an Aliyah Bet ship, the body was publicly displayed to the press after the ship docked in Haifa for transfer of the passengers to Cyprus, and journalists were told that \"the dirty Nazi-British assassins suffocated this innocent victim with gas.\"\n\nIn 1946, Irgun carried out the [King David Hotel bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing), an attack on the building where the central branches of the civil and military administration of Palestine were based, killing 91 people. The British response was swift and severe, instituting nationwide curfews on Jews, public floggings and executing convicted insurgents.\n\nThe commander of the British forces in Palestine, General Sir Evelyn Barker, who was having an affair with the wife of the late George Antonius (a leading Arab Nationalist), responded to the bombing by ordering British personnel to \"Boycott all Jewish establishments, restaurants, shops, and private dwellings. No British soldier is to have social intercourse with any Jew.... I appreciate that these measures will inflict some hardship on the troops, yet I am certain that if my reasons are fully explained to them they will understand their propriety and will be punishing the Jews in a way their race dislikes as much as any, by striking at their pockets and showing our contempt of them \"\n\nThe Jewish Agency was issuing constant complaints to the British administration about antisemitic remarks by British soldiers: \"they frequently said \"Bloody Jew\" or \"pigs\", sometimes shouted \"Heil Hitler\", and promised they would finish off what Hitler had begun. Churchill wrote that most British military officers in Palestine were strongly pro-Arab.\n\nIn 1947, all non-essential British civilians were evacuated from Palestine. In February, Bevin informed the House of Commons that the Palestine question would be referred to the United Nations. Meanwhile, a low-level guerrilla war and campaigns of terrorism continued through 1947 and 1948. Eventually, Jewish insurgency against the British was overshadowed by the Jewish-Arab fighting of the 1947\u201348 Civil War, which started following the UN vote in favour of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine.\n\nIn 1948, after almost 30 years or British occupation, the UK formally withdrew from Palestine and handed responsibility to the UN. Although the insurgency played a major role in persuading the British to quit Palestine, other factors also influenced British policy. Britain, facing a deep economic crisis and heavily dependent on the United States, was facing a massive financial burden over its many colonies, military bases, and commitments abroad. At the same time, Britain had also lost the centrepiece of the rationale of its Middle East policy after the end of the British Raj in Colonial India. Britain's Middle East policy had been centred around protecting the flanks of its sea lines of communication to India. After the British Raj ended, Britain no longer needed Palestine.\n\nIn the resulting power vacuum left by the British withdrawal, the Jews and Arabs were left to punch it out over the fate of Palestine. After a brief war lasting 10 months, the Jews emerged as victors and they declared Israel a free state shortly after. The rest, as the saying goes, is a clusterfuck.", "score": 57, "subreddit": "soccer", "date_year_month": "2018-02", "created_utc_converted": "2018-02-02 13:38:20", "score_overall": 24, "words": "conspiracy jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish holocaust jewish holocaust jewish jewish jewish jew jewish jew jewish jewish", "shared_words": "conspiracy jewish holocaust jew", "socre_distint": 4}

Plus the various dictators in Middle Eastern countries have been scapegoating Jews/Israel as a distraction from abuses in their own countries since its founding in 1948. Added to that Israel has made a lot of enemies by being very aggressive in proactive self defense. Their idea of self defense is somewhat paranoid, pretty much what you would expect from a country whose identity as a state was formed during a time of historic genocide. Their treatment of the Palestinians has been in line with that attitude of aggressive self defense and has not done them any favors either. \n\nTo top it all off, Israel is now a mostly prosperous European standard of living country, after starting off with small groups of indigenous Jews, a rag tag collection of early 20th century idealists (many of whom were literally teenagers from Europe living in communes) plus refugees from the Holocaust and Jews expelled from Middle Eastern countries in a backwater country not attractive enough to be colonized by European powers. Its prosperity, especially contrasted with the Palestinians poverty, plays into many historic prejudices. \n\nBecause there are legitimate criticisms of Israel, it can sometimes be difficult to see whether it is prejudices or reasonable criticism for those who are not deeply versed in the history.

To give you an idea, intermarriage in the American Jewish community is around 50%, and the overwhelming majority of those intermarried partners are white. Most American Jews are not Orthodox and largely assimilated into generic white American culture. When it comes to Jews on the left, it is true that a majority are democrats, but it's unclear whether this is really so extremely disproportionate for generally affluent coastal city dwellers (ie. archetypal 'blue tribe' in SSC parlance) which we mostly are. Most of the recent social justice activism, far from being some evil conspiracy by us against whites, equally targets Jews - when people talk about reducing the proportion of white men in Hollywood, guess what - Jeffrey Katzenberg, JJ Abrams and so on are all counted as white in that calculation. And that's not to even touch on specific stuff like BDS. \n\n&gt;that Jews have been at the forefront of opposing any attempts to keep the United States as a majority-white nation. \n\nSo have Irish - in fact arguably Irish activism and an Irish Catholic president were far more important to the 1965 bill than Jews, yet of course modern white nationalists have no problem with Irish people. \n\n&gt;white nationalists and orthodox Zionists are united by a common thread of thought. \n\nMost Orthodox Zionists, for all their problems, don't want to remove all Jews from America, which appears to be the present 'alt right' position. Unsurprisingly, that's not really negotiable from our perspective. \n\n&gt;The \"antisemitism\" of white nationalism comes not from any inherent disdain for Jews as a people\n\nIt does, though. It's right there in their frequent use of nazi-era terminology and propaganda, in their repurpose of old-school blood libel, in their language of us as parasites and leeches, in their desire for expulsion or extermination, in their painting of us as secret masterminds of mass immigration, rapacious capitalism, all-powerful socialism/welfare and 'white genocide', in their vicious and unrelenting caricature of us as a 'race', and in their visceral hatred of our religion (inc. especially, for some reason, talmud). That is hatred, and it's far stronger and deeper than any opposition to our support for some twentieth century immigration policy. \n\n---\n\nPersonally, as a right wing, somewhat reactionary (in the Moldbug sense) Jew, I sympathise with some of these people on the american right. However, they should realise that, while mass immigration is problematic and I personally oppose it myself, their struggle and suffering comes much more from the loss of their own religious, cultural and ethnic traditions over the last century or so, than it does from recent demographic change. Most WN's solely define themselves in opposition to other racial, ethnic or religious groups, and that's both unhealthy for them and dangerous for everyone else around them.

You have a scenario where religious Jews do come into town, build Jewish utilities (synagogue, mikvah, eruv), attract more Jews because those features are there, and then in a lot of cases take over local governments and local school boards to drain the school districts of funding (because the Jews aren't sending kids to those schools anyway, except for special ed which costs a ton), and really do change the tenor of the town.  Towns are really scared, not because they hate Orthodox Jews, but because this is happening all over Jersey.  Sure, housing values are going up, but as places to live (if you are not an Orthodox Jew) the community itself changes a great deal. \n\nTo some extent, I think this breeds strange anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and odd hatred.

I do not intend to influence others. If it was not clear already from my initial post, I'm definitely not a holocaust denier, nor do I sympathize with the Nazis in regards to their atrocious conduct. Please don't accuse me of misconduct for simply attempting to educate myself.\n\nI know that the US entry into the war was instrumental at ending the war, but would you agree or disagree that the German Revolution was also instrumental in ending the war? I know, for instance, that Wilson dropped pamphlets via plane throughout Germany. The pamphlet's contained a German translated version of Wilson's Fourteen points. I've also heard mention that when the Germans came to the Paris Conference they were expecting from Wilson a return on the promises made by his Fourteen Points, specifically self-determination for the German people. The Fourteen Points might have been one aspect that increased the efforts and the hopes of the German revolutionaries.\n\nI'd like to hear your thoughts on the above. Are these beliefs incorrect? Again, I'm not claiming to know everything, nor am I trying to influence others, I'm just trying to make discoveries and am attempting to educate myself. If you refute my claims I'm happy to revise any of my views. You know more than I do.\n\nI personally do not believe in any Jewish conspiracies. I'm more curious as to how so many intelligent German people were so easily manipulated into thinking that there was. Remember, the Germans were certainly not dumb, they were highly educated. Infact, prior to the shift in power resulting from the wars, most people would move from countries like America to Germany and France in order to study.\n\nI've heard that there were pacifist gatherings at Switzerland during the war and that Lenin was influenced to conduct his revolution while he was at Switzerland. I think I also heard that one of the leaders of Switzerland attempted to aid negotiations between the Russian monarchy and the revolutionaries. When this was found out, people were upset because it violated Switzerland's neutrality and he had step down. In a possibly unrelated note, I've heard that the Zionist Congress used to regularly hold meetings in Switzerland prior to the war.\n\nWhether or not the Swiss pacifist gatherings had any impact on the Jewish-German revolutionaries, I'm not entirely sure. It is a fact though that most of the revolution leaders were Jewish, the most famous being Rosa Luxemburg. Now, I personally don't think that this has anything to do with a Jewish conspiracy. But, at the same time I can see how Germans could easily be manipulated into thinking that there was a Jewish conspiracy if someone pointed out that the revolution leaders Rosa Luxemburg et al. were all Jewish. Note that tensions were already high during the post war, pre-WWII period thanks to the German economy crumbling due to reparation debt and the people needed some kind of scapegoat.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the above? Do you agree or disagree? What are your suspicions as to why so many intelligent Germans were so easily convinced of a Jewish conspiracy?\n", "score": 1, "subreddit": "AskHistory", "date_year_month": "2018-02", "created_utc_converted": "2018-02-11 08:48:16", "score_overall": 12, "words": "holocaust jewish jewish jewish jewish conspiracy jewish conspiracy jewish scapegoat jewish conspiracy", "shared_words": "holocaust jewish conspiracy scapegoat", "socre_distint": 4}
{"author": "Trubbles", "body": "Continued:\n\n---\n\nThe foreman was a Sephardic Jew. At Passover, 1942, he invited me and a friend of mine to his Seder. The Hagada was the same, but they cooked rice, which for us was forbidden. The foreman had two sons fighting at the front, and two little boys at home. His wife had a small hand mill that she used to grind wheat into flour. She prepared special flour for matzos, so it was truly kosher for Passover. For my friend and me, it was just unbelievable that we were at what seemed like the end of the world, and were invited to a seder. It was a seder I will never forget.\nAbout a month later, we got yet another call to the Polish army. This time, we went to a place called Guzar, also in Uzbekistan. Again we were too late. We were free to go. \n\nI had heard of a city in Kazakhstan where there was food and work. I organized a group of fifty Jews, and got a document to allow us to travel, and to get bread and hot meals like demobilized soldiers did. \n\nWe went on a 2,000 kilometer journey to Kazakhstan, which took nearly a month. Conditions were very bad. By the time we arrived in Kazakhstan, there were only ten of us remaining, as most had given up and abandoned the journey.\n\nIn Kazakhstan, we went to the Polish representative, who referred us to a state farm, where you worked for wages. We all accepted. \n\nI started in the farm\u2019s machine shop. We worked 7 days a week, 12 hours a day, non-stop. This was war production. No one in the Soviet Union could take a day off to rest. Either you worked seven days a week, or you risked your life as cannon fodder in the army.\n\nThe chairman of the farm was a brutal beast who gladly would have sent everyone to jail. \n\nWe had to walk 6 kilometres to work. I had no shoes, only rags for my feet. So I committed the crime of absenteeism when I went to the Polish centre to ask how to get a proper pair of shoes. For this I was sentenced to prison, but because my job was necessary, instead of sending me to jail, they just reduced my pay by 25%. \n\nThere was a shortage of gasoline. Without gasoline, of course, the tractors could not function and the farm could not meet its quotas. I knew how to adapt a motor to work on kerosene, which there was plenty of. I told this to the chairman, who replied that we needed permission from the Communist Party, because if my idea did not work, we would be executed for sabotage. We got permission. I successfully adapted the tractor motors for kerosene. For this, I was branded a suspicious character by the local authorities. I later found out that with this label I could have been sent to prison for ten years with no trial. This happened because they believed that I was better educated than I had declared. \n\nAt that time, in the summer of 1944, a KGB colonel came on horseback through our farm and his horse lost a shoe. As the local blacksmith had been drafted into the army, they went to the city and got me.\n\nAs a young boy in Poland, a blacksmith living on my street showed me how to make a horseshoe. So I now was able to make the horseshoe, and put it on the KGB colonel\u2019s horse. I could never have realized what this meant to my future. I later learned that the colonel checked my personnel file, and found that I was under great suspicion of being an educated man who had lied about his education. The colonel did not believe that a well educated man could possibly make a horseshoe and put it on a horse, so he tore up my file. A woman who witnessed this later told me about it.  I was now a citizen in good standing, instead of an enemy of the people.\n\nIn 1945, the war ended, with Hitler\u2019s Germany destroyed. But my war did not end, I was still in remote Kazakhstan.\n\nIn January 1946, I received a letter from the US embassy in Moscow, that a visa for me to enter the USA had been approved by the State Department. I should come to Moscow to get a permit to leave the USSR. But in March 1946, we got the news that we could return to Poland. On the eve of Passover, we were loaded into a freight train which was to take all the Polish citizens in the area back to Poland. In the end, there were about 80 cars, each holding about 60 men. \n\nI became friendly with some Jews from Ukraine. One told me something I will never forget: \u201cYou are going to the USA. Please tell our Jewish brothers there these words: \u201cOur ancestors were slaves to Pharoah in Egypt. They had a good deal. They were slaves to a king. We here are slaves, enslaved to slaves.\u201d\n\nAt Passover 1946, our train started toward Poland. In the freight car we said this was just like the exodus from Egypt. It took six weeks to reach Poland. At the border, we stopped at Brest-Litovsk, the last city on the Russian side. It was a famous Jewish city, we went to find the Jewish sector, which was destroyed. \n\nWhen we crossed the border into Poland, people threw stones at us, thinking we were all Jews. The train\u2019s destination was Szczecin, a former German city. I and some other Jews got off the train near Warsaw. I arrived in Warsaw on May 8, 1946 in Warsaw, one year after the war\u2019s end. The city was destroyed. There was only a remnant left of the Jewish community. So I returned to my hometown. I found one Jewish family: an old woman, her daughter who was my former school teacher, and the teacher\u2019s little son. They let me stay with them. There was no one else \u2014 everyone had disappeared. My mother, my brother and the twins were gone. All my other friends and relatives were gone.\n\nI returned to Warsaw to find out how to get my visa to the USA. Around this time, there were anti-Jewish riots in Warsaw, even though only a few thousand Jews remained in Poland out of the three million that lived there before the war.\n\nNone of my immediate family had survived the war. All I learned was that in November 1941, all the Jewish community from my hometown was moved to the ghetto in Warsaw, and from there to the extermination camp Treblinka. In Leni Yahil\u2019s exhaustive book \u201cThe Holocaust \u2013 the Fate of European Jewry,\u201d there is the following story: \u201cRabbi Israel Shapira, who had been the Admor of Grodzisk for close to 50 years, declined to make use of the immigration papers his disciples in the United States had obtained for him. Instead, he was sent to Treblinka with the rest of the community and according to eye witness evidence, \u201che preached to them at the entrance to the gas chamber, singing Ani Ma\u2019amin (\u2019I Believe\u2019) with them.\u201d\n\nI visited my Polish friends in my hometown. They treated me well. One elderly Polish woman showed me some things from our home and told me I can have everything I want. My mother had asked her, if her older son survived, to give him all her prayerbooks. I have these today.\n\nI heard that some of my cousins had given their small children to a convent in Sochachew, so I went to the Catholic priest in our home town and asked him for a letter to let me into the convent, maybe I would recognize some of my cousin\u2019s children. I was not allowed in. But this priest told me that before my mother was sent to the Warsaw ghetto, she gave a Torah to the priest. This Torah had been written decades earlier by my mother\u2019s father. He had been childless, and had vowed to God to write a torah if a child was born. He began the torah when my mother was born and completed it before her wedding, and so her wedding was a double simcha. \n\nThe priest had given the torah to some other Jews, survivors from my home town. They left for the city of Lodz, and took the Torah with them. I tried to find the Torah but never did. \n\nIn June 1946, I finally connected with my wife in Brooklyn. She arranged for me to go to New York. On January 2, 1947, I flew from Warsaw to Paris. After 7 years of life under Hitler\u2019s and Stalin\u2019s tyranny, I was in the free world. I sat down and wrote my wife a long letter of my stories. My wife responded that I should not talk about that any more.\n\nOn February 19, 1947, I departed on a liberty ship for the USA. My wife met me at the port in Manhattan. What I felt then is difficult to put into words. My wife asked me where I want to go, to a hotel, maybe to Florida. I said I would like to go to where I would be away from the public. \n\nThe house where my wife and her mother were living was behind a barber shop. I went in with my uncle to get a haircut. At that time, the Soviet Union was viewed by many as a workers paradise. My uncle told people who I was, and they started to ask me questions. They did not like my stories about the Soviet Union, believing that I was simply repeating the words of the anti-communist newspapers. My uncle defended me, saying I had just gotten off the boat that morning, my experiences were first-hand. \n\nIt was now Passover. I went to a Mizrachi shul across the street. When I told them the message from our brothers in the Soviet Union that slaves in Egypt had a bargain, they also didn\u2019t believe me. The fact was that Americans at that time had no idea what life was like in the Soviet Union.\n\nI went to work in New York, and attended school at night to learn English.\n\nMy wife died from hepatitis at the end of 1947. I felt like I had reached the end of my life. One day I stood on a bridge over the river in New York, contemplating jumping. What changed my mind was the thought that by doing such a thing, I would be giving Hitler one more victim. I remembered the words of my rabbi when I was 12 years old, \u201cas long as I could help other people, I would always find a way to survive and I should not feel sorry for myself.\u201d I went home.\n\nAt night school, I met Carol %^&amp;&amp;$. We were married in New York, and had two children. We moved to Toronto in 1958. I had a long and successful career in the hosiery business in Toronto. My son Sammy died in 1977 and my wife Carol in 1999. Today I am blessed with my daughter Marla, my son-in-law $%#@, my three beautiful grandchildren, my dear friend Helen $%%#, and a healthy and happy life.\n", "score": 17, "subreddit": "todayilearned", "date_year_month": "2018-02", "created_utc_converted": "2018-02-12 05:29:44", "score_overall": 10, "words": "jew kosher jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish holocaust", "shared_words": "jew kosher jewish holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "pizzashill", "body": "A number of reasons. The hatred of Jews wasn't some new development in Europe.\n\n\nJews have always been the convenient minority to scapegoat during times of decadence in Christian countries.\n\nFrom the book suspicious minds:\n\n&gt; Superstition and prejudice toward Jews dates back to the earliest years of Christianity. Saint John Chrysostom, a fourth-century preacher widely admired for his eloquence, eloquently denounced Jews as baby-killing devil worshipers. In 1215, Pope Innocent III was concerned that Christians might find themselves unwittingly having relations with Jews. His solution was to make Jews wear distinguishing clothing, leading to the yellow \u201cbadge of shame\u201d that many Jewish people around Europe were required to wear throughout the Dark Ages\u2014and again under the Nazis. A couple of decades later, Pope Gregory IX established the Inquisition, a formalized effort to prosecute heresy against the Roman Catholic Church, which eventually led to mass executions of Jews, among other accused heretics, and mass burnings of their holy books.\n\n&gt; According to the pious logic of some medieval theologians, the Jewish Talmud was both blasphemous and, paradoxically, a testament to the truth of Christian teaching. Just as the Devil knows the truth of Christianity but is determined to deny it and destroy those who believe it, so too, Christian scholars argued, do the Jews. People came to see Jews as being in league with Satan, possessing arcane knowledge and black magic, and harboring an unquenchable hatred for Christianity. Allegations that Jewish people were plotting against Christians became commonplace.\n\n&gt; One popular theory had it that Jews were in the habit of poisoning Christian drinking wells. When the Black Plague ravaged fourteenth-century Europe, outbreaks were often blamed on the international Jewish well-poisoning conspiracy. In some cases, torturers coerced confessions from a handful of Jewish suspects, on the basis of which thousands more were burned alive. The worst of the pogroms was in Strasbourg. Fear-stricken locals, desperate to prevent the plague from reaching them, decided to preemptively slaughter the town\u2019s Jews. (Some of the town\u2019s nobility were also in debt to Jewish money-lenders, and may have seen an opportunity to clear their tab.) City authorities attempted to intervene but couldn\u2019t hold the mob at bay. All told, around nine hundred Jewish people were burned alive, and the rest were baptized or banished. The plague soon swept through town regardless, leaving sixteen thousand people dead in its wake.\n\n&gt; There was also the \u201cblood libel\u201d\u2014the allegation that Jewish people routinely murder Christians and drain them of their blood, which they allegedly used to make the Passover meal, to make medicine to heal their physical defects, or to perform unholy rituals. The myth was invented in the twelfth century, when a young Christian boy was found dead on the outskirts of Norwich, England, the day before Easter Sunday. Thomas of Monmouth, a Benedictine monk turned amateur detective, offered a convoluted explanation. Jewish teaching, he claimed, asserts that Jews must spill Christian blood in order to regain their homeland. Thus, a secret council of Jewish elites convenes once a year to select a sacrificial Christian child. Monmouth\u2019s idea caught on. For centuries thereafter, whenever a Christian child went missing or turned up dead, local Jews were often the first suspects.\n\n&gt; These religiously motivated fears circulated for centuries. Meanwhile, Jews in many regions were denied citizenship and property rights, confined to ghettos, or banished from Christian society altogether. This began to change in the wake of the French Revolution, when many Jewish people were granted basic human rights and began to emerge from isolation. They naturally tended to favor liberal and democratic political policies that represented their best hope of increasing liberty. Still sidelined from traditional occupations, many migrated to the cities and pioneered inventive new ways of making a living. While most remained impoverished and out of sight, a few became extremely wealthy.\n\n&gt; This all led to new social tensions. A lot of people weren\u2019t thrilled about the radical changes taking place around them. For some, the newly integrated Jews became a defining symbol of the modern world. The age-old prejudice that had given rise to the blood libel and well-poisoning myths was reinvigorated and updated to reflect modern anxieties and resentments. Jews were no longer enemies of God, but enemies of man. In 1879, a new word, antisemitism, was coined to reflect the fact that what was once a collection of primitive medieval superstitions had become a fully-fledged political ideology.\n\nBut it took a racial turn in the mid 1800s, due to the rise of Racial hygiene.\n\nEvans, in the third Reich trilogy, talks about the ideas that went into Nazism:\n\n&gt; The death of democracy in Germany was part of a much broader European pattern in the interwar years; but it also had very specific roots in German history and drew on ideas that were part of a very specific German tradition. German nationalism, the Pan-German vision of the completion through conquest in war of Bismarck\u2019s unfinished work of bringing all Germans together in a single state, the conviction of the superiority of the Aryan race and the threat posed to it by the Jews, the belief in eugenic planning and racial hygiene, the military ideal of a society clad in uniform, regimented, obedient and ready for battle\u2014all this and much more that came to fruition in 1933 drew on ideas that had been circulating in Germany since the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Some of these ideas, in turn, had their roots in other countries or were shared by significant thinkers within them - the racism of Gobineau, the anticlericalism of Schonerer, the paganist fantasies of Lanz von Liebenfels, the pseudo-scientific population policies of Darwin\u2019s disciples in many countries, and much more. But they came together in Germany in a uniquely poisonous mixture, rendered all the more potent by Germany\u2019s pre-eminent position as the most advanced and most powerful state on the European Continent. In the years following the appointment of Hitler as Reich Chancellor, the rest of Europe, and the world, would learn just how poisonous that mixture could be.", "score": 1, "subreddit": "worldnews", "date_year_month": "2018-02", "created_utc_converted": "2018-02-21 08:14:10", "score_overall": 15, "words": "scapegoat jewish jewish jewish jewish conspiracy jewish jewish jewish libel jewish jewish jewish jewish libel", "shared_words": "scapegoat jewish conspiracy libel", "socre_distint": 4}

for example, so they have a choice, either you are against healthcare and you are pro-gun or you are pro-healthcare but against guns (it's a lose-lose situation used commonly in politics to play to the base for easy points), the measure is passed or rejected (depending on the donors who lobbied) and the poiltican recieves an unmarked slip with their reward (metaphor).\n\nDirty money/dark money. \n\nSoros may be just as guilty of lobbying (yet to confirm), but he is donating to causes that typically do alot of good, as a rule I am distrusting of polticians and donors, soros might seem a tad shady on a bad day, but there are FAR WORSE doing much more than him.", "score": 1, "subreddit": "politics", "date_year_month": "2018-02", "created_utc_converted": "2018-02-23 23:20:31", "score_overall": 7, "words": "scapegoat jewish jewish illuminati conspiracy scapegoat conspiracy", "shared_words": "scapegoat jewish illuminati conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

Below is a post I made regarding the possibility that Jews are just as individualistic as Liberalism teaches us to be and just happen to be gifted intellectually.\n\n&gt;There are about 750 million Europeans in the world and about 15 million Jews.\n\n&gt;Do you genuinely believe that there are more intelligent Jews than 'whites'?\n\n&gt;If you think the average Ashkenazi IQ being 110-115 compared to the average European being 100 is the sole reason you are beyond stupid. Not to mention not all Jews are Ashkenazi the other Jewish ethnicities are lower IQ which is why Israel's average IQ isn't high (Also 25% of their population is arab which probably drags it down a lot too)\n\n&gt;Let's say there are 10 million Ashkenazi (according to google) and they have an average IQ of 115, do you really think there aren't 10 million Europeans with IQs above 115?\n\n&gt;115 is the 84th percentile according to https://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/iqtable.aspx meaning 16% of people are above it\n\n&gt;16% of 750 million people = 120 million people\n\n&gt;Due to the nature of 115 being the mean IQ for ashkenazi Jews that means many of them will have an IQ lower so we will say 60% of them are 115 or above, this makes 6 million\n\n&gt;So there are about 20 times as many Europeans that are part of this 'high IQ' club that many Jews are in\n\n&gt;How do you explain Jews being so powerful according to this? Are there SUPERJEWS that have 10,000,000 IQ and they are the small elite that run everything? Or perhaps there are reasons beyond IQ?\n\n\nI don't doubt that Jews are intelligent, but they do have a very sketchy history. There is nothing wrong with the ethnocentrism and togetherness they display, in fact I actually quite admire it. I just don't like the way they screw over other people to become successful, I have much more respect for industriousness and military might than I do for 'shystering'. There's a common adage in the business world that many people know, and that is to never do a deal with a Jew. \n\n", "score": 14, "subreddit": "DebateAltRight", "date_year_month": "2018-02", "created_utc_converted": "2018-02-24 01:40:08", "score_overall": 10, "words": "jewish goyim goyim jewish jew conspiracy jewish jewish jewish jew", "shared_words": "jewish goyim jew conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

I am sure these some were truthful hundreds of years back, but then again, what were other ethnicities up to in those days? \n\nWell everyone already knows about the Jews since the 1700s, I was simply showing you that Jewish subversive behaviour didn't start when they amassed massive financial power through the advent of Central Banks, which most people familiar with the Jewish Question seem to believe.\n\n&gt;I want to discuss Jews 50-80 years back at most, not how they weren\u2019t willing to pay taxes back in the days of Rome. I want to know how they control today\u2019s western countries for the reasons I wrote bold above.\n\nI'm not an expert on 20th century Jewry but the things I mentioned were obviously continued. You see examples of it in books from the 'anti-semites' that fought back against Jewish behaviour in their countries such as in For My Legionaries. (great book btw)\n\nI know that Jews were the ones pushing communism, owned most the newspapers etc. This is pretty much the sole reason Fascism and other third position ideologies shot up so rapidly. Jews had a stranglehold on everything, people saw that the communists were doing in the East and feared that would happen to their country too. The students and the workers were looking like they were going to revolt, there were strikes across European countries and such, wealthy Jews that were connected to the newspapers were connected with the police and politicians, this meant they could suppress those that fought back against the revolutionaries. Jews/Bolsheviks were gaining a lot of momentum in Europe and the Nationalists saw that communism really wasn't what it was advertising itself as. It was not something for the workers to rise up and improve their quality of life, it was just a way of overthrowing the government and replacing it with a Jewish one, then you have all the starvation and shit but you know I don't really need to teach you about how cancerous communism is. If you research Fascist and other third position movements you see many of them came from previously leftist/socialist backgrounds, but were vehemently opposed to bolshevism. Something that's interesting to note is that Jews simultaneously were hugely prevalent in International Capitalism/Finance as well as being the driving force of Bolshevism/Communism which is supposedly anti-bourgeoisie. This shows that Jews aren't monolithic, or that they were simply using Communism as a means to the end of consolidating more power, I think it's the former but many argue the latter. Specifically when discussing the Rothschilds the topic of playing both sides comes up a lot, since they have a history of funding both sides in wars and things of that nature.\n\n&gt;I want you to show me evidence of them working againts the interest of the host\u2019s country\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeeFvoUHUYw is an example. You can find a bunch of examples daily if you keep your eye on the media and journalists. Type 'fellow white' into twitter and you'll find hundreds, if not thousands of Jewish individuals that pretend to be white whilst saying 'Hey we should do *this thing that hinders white people and/or benefits non-whites*'.\n\nFor today's world, you can find examples extremely easily literally everywhere you look, it's up to you to open your eyes, I can't spoonfeed you everything. You will simply reject specific examples because I haven't shown to you that there's a secret conglomeration of every Jew ever coming together and plotting in a conspiracy. There probably isn't a massive conspiracy, it's just simple biology really. **All humans have ingroup preference, groups are opposed to each other, an outgroup having power in a country means the natives' interests will not be prioritised, thus the 'JQ' is born.**\n\nThere are so many seemingly small things but once you notice how many there are and how common they are you begin to realise something is a bit odd. How come if only 2% of the population is Jews anti-semitism is such a massive concern? Why are the US giving billions in aid to Israel? What's up with all the tax-exempt Jewish organisations? What's with the near endless supply of Jewish organisations for Jewish interests? What's with the near endless Jewish organisations for non-white interests? What's with organisations for white interests being deemed racist and evil and not being able to exist? Why are the US bombing the shit out of every country that Israel doesn't like? Why are we constantly reminded every day about a genocide of an outgroup, what about the genocides of our own people such as the Holodomor? (which was more people than the Jews in the holocaust even by the largest estimate of 6 million) Why is there such a massive prevalence of Kosher food in America? Why are almost all American men circumcised? Why is America so semito-centric? Ever heard of the term judeo-christian values and other such things? If you don't realise America is pretty much fully controlled by Jews, you have to be blind. \n\nThere isn't really one concrete thing that proves Jews are subversive, it's just a massive pile up of many different Jewish groups working for their own interests which is naturally at the expense of white people. Then at the highest levels such as hollywood, in the media, banking etc there probably is some dodgey shit going on but we can't really know what exactly so it's mostly speculation and connecting dots from what they give us, which is a lot of anti-white media.

I was born in the US, but so I would not lose contact with my ancestral land my parents sent me to family in Poland for some time. The first time was to do a year of primary school as I knew no Polish. The second time they suggested I visit for gap year before college. As I'm 30 now, all of this was quite a long time ago.\n\nThe governments in Poland were pro-EU back than and the future was looking bright. Still, I have memories like \"ty Zydzie\" (\"you Jew\") being the insult of choice when I did my year or primary school in Poland. And it was a private school for middle/upper class. Those kids and their parents are actually not anti-Semitic in real life. It's just the \"insult\" seemed popular at the time and it was repeated by all. I told this to my parents and grandma (who was taking care of me in Warsaw). The family was shocked so my Grandma went to the school to object. She was met with indifference, as in \"so? what's the problem, it doesn't mean anything\". But it does mean a lot it shows how deep it goes.\n\nMy gap year was an experience like all later shorter visits since than up to 2015. I was shocked by how many believe all the worst conspiracy theories about Jews. I mean it was like the Jews were some sort of Illuminati reptilians. The Jewish greed theory is a great example of that. The most shocking thing I found was different. Liberals (of Jewish and not of Jewish decent) are \"given\" supposedly real Jewish names and often called by them, think all Poles from the liberal Gazeta Wyborcza. Those are used to mock them at far right media like Niezalezna, Gazeta Polska, wPolityce or Sieci (the Sieci or as it was called some time ago \"W Sieci\" is nice to put in Google Images with the world \"okladka\" - which means cover - no other tabloid has used such images anywhere, yes the one in light of the crisis is anti-Semitic). Well since PiS came to power people from those outlets replaced liberals at state media, often very high up. So this was a warning sign a year before the law controversy.\n\nFrom 2015 when PiS took power the facade was dropped. I mean all other Polish governments from 1990 till 2015, apologized for say the Jedwabne pogrom and agreed with the realistic narrative. Sociologist/historian Jan Gross, author of the \"Neighbors\" book about the subject got state rewards etc. Now the facade is gone. Gross is a prime example. He is now ridiculed by Polish right wing and state media. IPN fired most normal historians and employ far right ones like Nowak, who attributes the Polish made pogrom specifically to Germans. He disregards all witnesses and bases his research on... a single German bullet found near the barn (not even sure if from the pogrom). Which of course is absurd reasoning for normal historians, as this means nothing in war times, when weapons changed hands, were stolen etc. That is why the \"as opposed to facts\" is so dangerous in the new law, as the government is re-writing facts.\n\nOK, sorry to bore you as you are all tired of the subject, but I wanted to get it off my chest and show someone how it is. I'm genuinely scarred when I come to Warsaw now, to voice my opinions (which are basically the worldwide consensus).

Late in the nineteenth century Joseph Judah Chorny reported hearing from the Jews of Georgia, among whom he had traveled, of their ancestral tradition that the Armenians were descendants of the Amalekites, and **another Jewish traveler reported a bizarre practice in eastern Galicia, whereby the Armenians that did business with the local Jews would mourn Haman\u2019s death every Purim, and light candles in his memory.\u201d** \n\nWho the hell would MOURN Hamans death every Purim?

{"author": "sbot_crafter", "body": "The core of the Alt-Right might enjoy being called Nazis, but the vast majority of moderates won't go anywhere near Nazism.  Without the ability to draw upon the sea of moderates, the Alt-Right can't gain followers.  \n\n\nThe Alt-Right radicalization engine has a few major parts:\n\n*The Nozzle\n\nThe Nozzle is made up of so-called 'classical liberals' and anti-SJWs.  They pick and choose ridiculous-looking college students, clickbait headlines, and out-of-context quotes, and stuff them into a giant straw man scapegoat.  Through selective, even valid (though still one-sided and unrelenting) criticisms, they give momentum to the new Red Scare.  They even pick up Nazi-style propaganda words, like 'cultural Marxism' (a slightly reworded version of the Nazis' 'cultural Bolshevism', a supposed Jewish conspiracy to erode 'Western values').  The Nozzle serves to ramp-up paranoia towards the Left and liberalism.  For example, in the Gamer-Gate craze, they turned mild feminist criticism of video games into \"Feminists are taking our games!!!\"  Their primary role is to make young white males feel angry and threatened.\n\n\nIt's important to remember that the majority of the Nozzle is **not, itself, part of the Alt-Right**.  Some even make feeble attempts to denounce the Alt-Right, or even call themselves 'left-wing'.  But, nevertheless, they continue to focus on SJWs, especially feminists, almost exclusively.  They push 'both sides' rhetoric.  They believe Antifa is either as bad as or worse than the Alt-Right.\n\n\nCase study: Thunderf00t.  Doesn't like the Alt-Right, and has made this clear.  He even supports Stephen Colbert, who is extremely anti-Trump.  Still, he almost has a fetish for bashing feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian, and feminists in general.  They even appear in his more grounded scientific videos as memes.  Net negative effect.\n\n\nCase study: King Crocoduck.  Makes reasonable science videos, too.  However, the main attraction to his channel is a never-ending stream of fear mongering over 'feminist epistemology'.  He's stated that he believes Donald Trump and the Alt-Right are a lesser threat than feminists in the education system and academic community.  He genuinely believes that there is a wide-reaching feminist agenda to influence the conduct of 'hard science'.  In addition, he pushes the 'Frankfurt School' conspiracy theory, which is closely tied in with the 'cultural Marxism' scapegoat.\n\n\nIt's not just YouTubers, either.  People like Jordan Peterson also feature in the Nozzle.  I don't know how people who stay in the Nozzle without moving on to the Throat vote, but, regardless, they help push people further and further right.\n\n\n*The Throat\n\n\nAs the moderates travel down the Nozzle, they end up in the throat.  Here, you reach minor-scale racists, sexists, and other right-wingers.  Moderates go from being critical of the methods of feminists and SJWs to actual sexism and discrimination.  They go from saying things like \"The wage gap is due to the choices of women, and not necessarily systematic sexism\" to \"The wage gap is justified because it is based on the natural order of society\".  They go from saying things like \"Crime statistics show minorities are more likely to be dangerous\" to \"Minorities are inherently dangerous\".  They stop being 'SJW skeptics' and start being racial and sexual 'realists'.  You can find these people in The Red Pill subreddits, or in the I'm Going to Hell For This subreddit.  People continue to blame their problems on social justice movements.  They become outright hostile towards college campuses, and blame feminism for their inability to get girlfriends.  They start to believe communists and other left-wing 'globalists' are deliberately controlling the mainstream media to make their lives worse.\n\n\nThe leading thinkers in this area are people like Steve Bannon, a man who believes radical Islam is the greatest threat to 'Western Civilization' ever, and wants to militarize the USA and other countries against it.\n\n\nI suspect these people vote almost exclusively far-right.  They are no longer moderates, and they rarely escape.\n\n\n*The Reservoir \n\n\nIn the Reservoir, you get the explicitly Alt-Right people.  These are casual 4chan-ers agreeing with racist crap on /pol/, and The_Donald members.  They buy all of the rhetoric and propaganda hook, line, and sinker.    This is where most people stay.  They won't respond to any amount of convincing, as they're prepared to believe that any information opposed to their world view is leftist propaganda from the globalists.  They aren't, however, part of the ideological center....\n\n\n*The Core\n\n\nFew make it this far.  This is the ideological center.  Here, you'll find Holocaust deniers, KKK members, Nazis, and other far-right groups.  It's occupied by Richard Spencer, and others like him.  They generate buzzwords and talking points for those at the surface level.  They constantly re-label themselves to avoid the stigma surrounding Nazism and fascism.  Most of the Alt-Right find them unpalatable, and won't directly associate with them, but they would probably choose them over anything left-wing.  This is the source of the most vehement trolls, people with Pepe avatars who half-ironically support gassing minorities and liberals.  They peddle 'The Great Replacement' and 'White Genocide' to radicalize 'normies'.  These are the hard-core Redcaps.\n\n\nRecently, it's come to light that they like to hang around depression and loneliness subreddits to guide vulnerable men through the apparatus, and finally to the 'big reveal' of a mythical utopian racially pure ethnostate.

{"author": "Fuknmods", "body": "&gt;It just seems to me that the simpler explanation is just Jewish people are exceptional.  \n\nIt still doesn't make sense numbers wise. What makes them exceptional? If its IQ the overrepresentation cannot be explained by this since white geniuses outnumber jews of all intelligence bracket. If its not IQ then its a talent from practice then youd have to explain why dedication at something only affects jews more extremely than others when it comes to success. The simpler explanation is an in group preference and its even observable in your daily life. How many friends of yours got a job because they knew someone who could get it for them? Theres no merit or exceptional skill involved there, just some competence and a connection.\n\n&gt;If what you say is true, then in the context of capitalism, wouldn't Jewish hyper inherent desire to favor their own kind result in lost profits? \n\nYour list of applicants will be relatively similar in competence. You're not gonna have women studies graduates applying for jobs in the hospital as a doctor, you're going to have a bunch of people who are qualified vying for the position. When all things are equal or similar though, who are you likely to choose? The one who best appeals to you personally. Race is one instant appeal that can skew your position, especially if you have to work with them all day. \n\nYour argument isnt even solid on its own. An all male construction company can be more peofitable than all female or mixed sex companies. The fact that they only select their own sex does not lead to lost profits, it can even lead them to a higher market share.\n\n&gt;Assuming white gentiles are fairer, won't the genius white capitalist who hires the best be better off leaving jewish capitalist less fit? \n\nFrankly we dont know because we cant perform that experiment due to anti discrimination laws. You can go to abstract what ifs and possibles but in reality most businesses do not function on rationality. Furthermore how do you quantify \"the best\"? You cant require IQ tests for employment so you have no measure that is stable. Between a harvard and yale graduate who has better credentials? Between people that have many similar qualifiers how do you differentiate which is the best? Even if you do hire the best, how is your company somehow shielded from external market factors? A new bank with a rising market share doesnt get bailed out in 2008, did hiring the best save him from loss?\n\n&gt;I don't have figures but I think Jewish exogamy among smart jewish men is high.  Just look around Jewish men marry chinese women. \n\nJewish virtual library puts intermarriage rates at 7.2% for the US and even mentions that in the US they are the least likely to intermarry so no its not as high as you think it actually is. Even so genius will not last forever since there is always an observed return to the mean.\n\n&gt;Your theory if true would not have this happening at such a (high?)rate. \n\nBut its not happening at a high rate and the rate itself is for all jews in the US not just the very top. Even if they are mixed race, a jewish woman giving birth to a black or chinese males offspring still leaves a jewish person since jewishness is determined through the mother. If you want to go denial of race and maternal inheritance of jewishness (as stated in talmud or torah) then even still a jewish father provides jewish heritage and likely a jewish community for the child to grow up in. Your jew chink hybrid is likely to grow up exposed to jewish theocracy and traditions alongside jewish heritage which remains the common link between various dominating companies in different financial sectors. \n\n&gt;Progressive ideals are usually not held by people who are fiercely in-group oriented. If anything Jews are the MOST delusional and in denial about race and IQ.\n\nYou can claim all you want that they are in denial but as jews they are taught that by their holy books that goyim are cattle, that they are not like us. They believe their religion but they also believe race and IQ arent real? Give me a break. Leftist jews recognize jews as a group distinct fron whites when good (muh anti semitism) and as white when bad (white hollywood rapists!) for them. Even jewish lefties typically are against open borders for israel despite being for open borders for the US ot Europe. \n\n&gt;Yes I agree that jews are endogamous and clannish but there is a large portion of them that are the complete opposite. My theory is that high IQ can enable the best and worst behaviors, if money is what you want and you happen to have exceptional IQ, then you will dominate economically.  But if social justice is your cup of tea, then you will dominate in that area as well.  \n\nSo you recognize their clannish tendency and their high avg iq. You also recognize that they are overrepresented in media, politics, finance, entertainment, pornography, banking, etc. You then recognize that in the world of today rather than your hypothetical free market, that there is a huge overlap of all these sectors with the only thing tying them all together being jewish heritage. Yet despite acknowledging all of this, its just IQ and any sort of innate clan preference is completely surpressed and all the relations between these fields are pure coincidence? Do you have any idea how much your argument sounds like denial of reality? \n\n&gt;So I don't this its a favoritism thing...its just a really high IQ thing, it seems to me, but I'll remain open minded.   \n\nIts not a favoritism thing if you intentionally misrepresent your average non jewish applicant for a job and thats what your argument relies on. When you realize that selecting the 130 iq jew over the 138 iq chinese doesnt lead to significant reductions in worker potential, favoritism explains the success, overrepresentation and even the relations among different sectors of the economy. When its the jews vs the goys and the goys versus jews and themselves its easy to see who wins and how that victory would establish itself in the real world, a jewish dominance despite not being numerous enough to dominate.

There is an anti-Semitic streak on the hard left. There always has been, Galloway disbanded Respect and told them to all join Labour, Loach did the same with Left Unity. \n\nIt's not so much the new members but the old ones coming back. It really wasn't this much of an issue before Corbyn - Ed is Jewish ffs, could you really see us electing a Jewish leader now without it coming up that they're Jewish? \n\nAlso there are plenty on the left that believe the Jews control everything or any other such bullshit conspiracy theories. I wish there wasn't but I've unfortunately met a few. \n\n\n&gt;If Corbyn was actually anti-semitic surely he could start crticising Israel a lot, while tolerating rising anti-semitism, allowing him to dismiss worries about anti-semitism in a way that would convince lots of people that the anti-semitism accusations were just slander. \n\nLiterally no-one is arguing Corbyn is anti-Semitic, just that he is very ignorant of it in his own circles, whether it be on Facebook, his lifelong friendships with Galloway and Livingstone, his Press TV appearance when he stood silently as a caller referred to Israel as 'a disease.' He only seemed to get serious about tackling it  towards the election. \n\n&gt; Standard anti-semitic tactics. Instead he had an enquiry I think was genuinely fair which found anti-semitism does happen in the party but just isn't institutional. And there is a probe into this facebook group and the people involved, and we'll have to see what comes of that. \n\nYou think it was fair but many Jews did not. In fact the rule about anti-Semites being allowed back in  is why we're in  the current mess, with the new 'left slate' NEC deciding Holocaust deniers like Mike Silver and Tony Greenstein should be sent on courses and not kicked out - luckily for us their desire for victimhood outweighed their desire to be in the party. It is institutional, the idea it isn't is laughable. \n\nCorbyn did nothing about anti-Semitism in the party for the first year and a half of his leadership, now it's a bigger problem than him. The favourite for general secretary has a mark of blatant anti-Semitism against her name ffs. \n\nit you who said Jews were biased by their experience of being Jewish in regards to anti-Semitism?

It's down to the hypocrisy that the hard left has survived on for all these years. \n\nThey abhor all abuse but won't condemn abuse of their opponents, they want internationalism but pursue isolationist socialism in one country.

First of all they were sold as slaves by other blacks and were then treated as such, same as any other slaves. Secondly they weren't dispelled en masse from over a hundred different countries/cities. Thirdly they weren't getting rounded up enough to justify inventing a new word for it (pogroms), the lynchings were bad but from what I understand very few actually took place (a lot less than a 1000 IIRC). Fourth if you look at the black communities in the US or the African countries they generally don't make the best of neighbors, so it would have been justified to try to drive them away to keep the neighborhood safe and prosperous (I don't think I need to pull up crimerates, poverty and IQ disparities, do I?), which disqualifies them as a an example.\n\n&gt; If you don't mind could you please give me an example of one other group who would have been a visible minority in Christian dominated Europe, and thus the perfect scapegoat?\n\nThroughout most of history Europe has been very pure without much so-called diversity so I can't give you any great examples.

If only they could have gotten more out.\n\nWas the anti-semitism unfounded though? Jews tried to [stage a communist revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Revolution_of_1918%E2%80%9319) in Germany a bit before Hitler rose to power so of course people are going to be suspicious of them. [International jewry declared war on Germany](https://socioecohistory.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/judea_declares_war_on_germany.jpg) as well (they didn't have a nation, so just economic war via boycotts, but still). And on top of this German jews were also accused of being the ones who brought in the Americans into WW1 against them which resulted in the poor state the Weimar Republic was in at the time. I admittedly don't know much about the last one so it might not be true, but if a group (mostly consisting of jews) had tried to at least stage a revolution once already it made sense to imprison them when you were sending the army away.\n\n&gt;A: There's a massive conspiracy of global Jewry (who are Luciferians that pray to Saturn and worship circles) who bake using the blood of gentiles, faked the Holocaust, caused the Black Plague and all the other ills of the world and wish for nothing more than world domination where every gentile is a slave. When I walk past a Jew in the street, we give each other a wink and tap on the side of our nose. ;)\n\nAm I wrong when I'm saying that a lot of jews are very openly advocating for policies that are overwhelmingly negative towards white people (like the aforementioned open borders, race-mixing, feminism etc.)? I don't think literally all jews do it, but they are overwhelmingly over-represented when it comes to these things. Do you do it consciously because you're evil satanists (your words, not mine) or is it more unconsciously because there's less risk of you being thrown out again (for the hundredth-something time) the less homogenous a society is (I.E more negative things to focus on fixing first) or is it all merely a cohencidence that your tribe is so over-represented?

{"author": "ValuableJackfruit", "body": "&gt; Halal food;kosher food \n\nWell one of the problems with halal food is that in the UK for example there has been a rise of animals being killed without being stunned first. This pisses off some people. The proceeds of halal food often go to Islamic organisations. This also pisses off some people. The fact that people are  demanding halal food in school in certain countries (France) which are very secularist and anti-displays of religion even Christianity, so special demands like these are met with hostility. In the UK, over a 100 Subway stores have removed pork from their menu because Muslims complained about it... these are legitimate issues, I don't know how people used to react to kosher food though, but Jews don't make demands like these today    (since the number of Orthodox Jews is very small both in Europe and US anyway).\n\n&gt;Most of the tenets of Islam are identical to the tenets of Judaism. \n\nThe problem isn't this, really. Orthodox Jews are not really anymore pleasant than the average religious Muslim, and I don't think people should have a problem with anybody criticizing religious teachings. However Jews were prosecuted for being ethnically Jewish during WWII, not for being religious. And even today the far right always brings up Talmudic irrelevancies to explain how Jews exploit gentiles or whatever, but this is a very stupid assumption because they are made based on Jews ethnicity, not their actual religious beliefs. Most of the Jews who are accused of engaging in things like Talmudic supremacy, like George Soros, are actually atheists and he has even spoken out against Israel and has supported Palestinian causes... trying to pin Judaism on someone just because they are an Ashkenazi Jew is like trying to assume that a random non-religious white person does something because it's in the Bible. \n\n&gt;  The \"kosher tax\" theory is identical the 'halal tax' theory.\n\nExplanation above explains why this is a ridiculous assumption about Jews since most of them are secular, liberal and don't read religious texts in the US or in Europe... Muslims on the other hand.... can't say the same thing about them. \n\n&gt; The 'dual loyalty' of Muslims and Jews \n\nBy dual loyalty I guess you mean to both Israel and the US. Yeah this is an American Jew thing, although I dont know how widespread this really is. But this is not religiously or ideologically based, it is ethnically based. When your grandparents were exterminated a few decades ago you probably do care that your ethnic group survives. I do not see this as a problem comparable to that of Muslims... I am not saying that Jewish interests groups cannot harm the interests of America, but it's a very different issue than the problem with Muslims having 'dual loyalties'. Because the problem with Muslims is that they don't have dual loyalties, they only have only loyalty: Islam. They don't have a loyalty to an ethnic group, or a country, the foundation of Islamic societies is not ethnicity, it's Islam. 'Muslim' is not a largely secular ethnic group like Ashkenazi Jews are,  it's not an ethnic group in any way, it is a religious group which tries to enforce things like sharia and bring problems such as honor killings, FGM, ultraconservatism, gang rape etc wherever they pop up in the West... \n\nThe problem with comparing Jews vs Muslims all comes down to the fact that one is a secular ethnic group who are often accused for being too liberal and spreading 'degeneracy' while Muslims are a religious group who have completely different ideas... these issues are not comparable in any way, and people who try to shut down criticism of Muslims by shouting about 'they used to say the same about Jews%%%%!!!!' are just too lazy to think and resort to false equivalancies instead. If we were dealing with a religious group like Orthodox Jews consisting a large percentage of the US elite etc, then yeah, that would probably lead to serious problems. \n\nA lot of those things in the link you posted are not really 'accusations' or false. Just a few examples. \n\nAccusations of usury and profiteering - this is true, Christians were forbidden from lending money and Jews were forbidden from respectable professions so they took to lending money and profiteering. This is why lots of Jewish families have become rich and still are today (Rothchilds)\n\nAccusations of anti-Christian bias - Well this is a reasonable assumption to make, pretty much all religious groups have biases against anybody who isn't a part of them \n\nAccusations of plotting to control the world - Well a lot of them do control the world but it's highly unlikely its a plot. Those conspiracy theory books that are listed have been confirmed to be fake. On the other hand, the ISLAMIC STATE is planning to take over the world, that is not an accusation or a conspiracy theory against Muslims, they openly state their aim. \n\nCan't be bothered to go through the rest but you get my point, Jews were an insular religious group in foreign nations for centuries, they most likely did engage in behavior that pissed off Christians. It's just called human nature... \n\n&gt; Because pork isn't really something tolerated in Judaism either.\n\nBut most Jews don't practice Judaism.\n\n&gt; I think you're bieng overly pedantic in an attempt to deflect.\n\nThat was really not my intention. I suggest you seriously start thinking about whether your perception is skewed because you are seeing things you want to see. It is possible that users on that site use Jews to attack Muslims but that doesn't stop others on there from saying anti semitic things either.\n\n", "score": 4, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "JordanPeterson", "date_year_month": "2018-03", "created_utc_converted": "2018-03-12 00:36:28", "score_overall": 10, "words": "kosher kosher jewish jew kosher jew jewish jewish conspiracy conspiracy", "shared_words": "kosher jewish jew conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "Bodark43", "body": "I am not aware of Ford actually handing out copies of the *Protocols* to his employees,  couldn't verify it easily.  But it may be someone is thinking of the *Dearborne Independent*.  It was a newspaper Ford acquired in 1919, and it quickly became a platform for his views and was widely distributed, even nationwide. By 1920, Ford had started to become quite famous: he had introduced a new technology,  affordable automobiles, very modern production methods, and was paying decent wages to his workers. He was the image of an American hero: self-made , self-educated , unpretentious , clever, hard-working, and wealthy. Some people wanted him for President, many wanted to hear what he had to say, and the *Independent* became a way for him to do that.\n\nFord was anti-Semitic, but not in the sense of being a Nazi: he had Jews working in his factories, and had a Jewish architect design them. When Jewish refugees were trying to flee Germany in the 1930's, he advocated letting them into the US ( unlike most US politicians) and when he later saw some of the film footage of the concentration camps, after WWII, it very probably hastened his decline and death.\n\nIf this seems contradictory, it is somewhat: Ford had many contradictions.  But some of it was the fairly common anti-Semitism found in the rural US.  The US currency was based on the gold standard.  This was felt ( perhaps justifiably) to be hindering available credit to farmers , and giving Wall Street bankers and financiers greater leverage.  When William Jennings Bryan campaigned for President on a Free Silver platform he gained great support from farmers, especially in the midwest and places like Michigan.\n\nAlthough bankers like J.P. Morgan were anything but Jewish, the  notion that there was an international Jewish conspiracy to control the world gold supply therefore had a ready audience in the rural US, and Ford was a Michigan farm boy who believed it  ( another famous rural Michigander, Charles Lindbergh, had similar views). He also was very much focused his entire life on helping farmers ( both the tractor and the soybean industry can be credited to him).  Fairly soon after Ford bought the *Independent*, he started talking about how the Jewish conspiracy was hindering the common man.  He  published  the Protocols of the Elders of Zion in the paper and discussed them.\n\nAlmost immediately , in 1920, one of the paper's editors left in disgust.  The other, William Cameron, would continue on.  Ford's name didn't appear attached to the articles, but it is inconceivable that , given Ford's management style, anything in the paper wouldn't be written without his approval.  The result was what we would now call a shit-storm, but not initially  as big as you would think.  Many of his Jewish employees must have been first and second generation Americans, and must have had plenty of experience , heard real stories, of real bigotry, if not pogroms, in Eastern Europe. Today, you would expect massive protests from the workers: his architect protested, but there were no strikes.  It was before the Holocaust, and small-scale anti-Semitism was common enough: for example,  landlords would often offer rooms only to \"Christian\" lodgers. Probably many recent Jewish immigrants simply shrugged it off. But the reaction did come: both Jewish newspapers like the Forward but also the New York Times ( Dec. 1, 1920) mocked and denounced it. Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish Supreme Court Justice, wrote  against it: ex-Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Howard Taft signed petitions against it.  An actual libel suit was filed by activist Aaron Sapiro in 1924, and though it was dodged by Ford lawyers for some time, eventually there was  a trial and Cameron was forced to take the hit, testifying in court that Ford had nothing to do with the content of the paper.  From this, and when  the Anti-Defamation League started a Ford boycott , in 1927, Ford surrendered and closed the paper.  He would  disavow his views after the trial- but it's not clear how sincerely. *The International Jew* was much later given  a second life in the Middle East, long after Ford's death,  published for anti-Zionist readers.\n\nFord experienced the same repercussions for being opposed to the War as the other millions of people in the US did for being opposed: none. When it started, like them he pitched in. If anyone doubted he was sincere in the war effort, perhaps the Willow Run plant turning out a new B-24 bomber every hour allayed their fears.\n\nFord had, as I said, a lot of contradictions.  He wanted to pay a living wage but was willing to employ a thug to run a goon squad to beat-up union organizers or anyone who might become one. He had a great deal of ingenuity and imagination when it came to creating his Model T, but became a barrier to innovation in his plants later, when the technology and markets changed. He created a lot of urban problems with his high-impact industrial plants, but seemed to feel that his workers only needed to pretend that they were all living in a small Michigan farm town.\nSteven Watt's *The People's Tycoon* is the best recent book on him, and offers perhaps the best approach to understanding him: thinking of him as various people, all named Henry Ford.", "score": 54, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "date_year_month": "2018-03", "created_utc_converted": "2018-03-13 18:15:03", "score_overall": 14, "words": "jewish jewish jewish jewish conspiracy jewish conspiracy jewish holocaust jewish jewish jewish libel jew", "shared_words": "jewish conspiracy holocaust libel jew", "socre_distint": 5}
{"author": "GuillotinesNOW", "body": "Fair warning, this is a lot to take in, and it's still fresh to me, so it's not as neat and tidy as I'd like, but it's too compelling to keep to myself.\n\nBackstory: I love Browning's poems, and years ago, I wanted to understand one called Porphyria's Lover. I looked into it, and found the disease in the poem, porphyria, or the Royal Disease, has a huge incidence among Ashkenazi Jews, as do a huge number of other genetic disorders. The historic cure for porphyria was drinking blood. From there, I found this disease called Tay-Sachs which only affects them, and there is no cure, but thought nothing of it.\n\nYears after finding that, I read a novel that had a character with Tay-Sachs, who was taken from her family to be with people who cured her with blood, and it was written in a way that I have come to associate with hidden meaning - not to mention the link between porphyria, blood drinking, and Tay-Sachs - so I looked in earnest in to Tay-Sachs, and it turns out that there is a cure, only to be found in Israel, and the kids who are diagnosed with the disease are taken from their families to Israel to get treatment. It's hard as hell to find what that treatment is, but.... It's blood, and marrow. It has been cured with a transfusion of pure umbilical blood, a full replacement of all blood within the child, though historically, it was done through, again, bibens sanguinum (which is the Hebrew translation of the word \"Damascus\", because it was where Cain slayed Abel), or literally, drinking blood, done every so often. This has been a theme since Canaanites came into existence.\n\nOk so, yeah, I'm a crazy person, right? I have to be making this up, and no one else in history might have stumbled upon this imagined trail of bread crumbs. Turns out that the time in which Jews migrated to Europe, there also happened to arise the mythos of vampirism. You can escape a vampire if you drop a coin on the ground. Bram Stoker's Dracula was a Jew. Elizabeth Bathory was a Jew. Motzah balls, traditional ones served at passover, call for the blood of gentile children, and it is a well-kept secret that this practice continues in some circles today. Hemophilia (love of blood) is a typically Ashkenazi disease (Factor XI deficiency).\n\nI should say that I don't think all Ashkenazi are literally vampires, but that the myth of vampirism arose from them. Speaking of, look at Marina Abramovic, the Spirit Cooking lady. She's fucking 70. She is quite obviously a Jew, but her wikipedia page has been scrubbed of any mention of her heritage, though it still lists it in search engines.  From there, I found out about \"blood libel\" and that Ashkenazi Jews have been responsible for the Jews expulsion from 350+ nations over the past few hundred years. 100+ of those were for blood rituals involving the murder of gentile male Christian children under the age of 7 (NSFL)................................. Here's a very suppressed book, written by a Rabbi, chronicling the history of Jewish blood ritual.\n\nIf the Ashkenazi don't interbreed with the races around them, their DNA breaks down within 3 generations, as if there were no \"glue\" to hold them together, but also, it seems to me, in a symbolic sense, that there is no growth, no evolution, no negentropy. It seems they are always dying, never growing.\n\nThe kicker is that these Jews, the evil ones who engage in this practice, are not even Jews, and it has been proven. You won't find anything but the typical apologetics that occur when an individual or group accidentally expose them, but the popular genetics website 23andme concluded the link between the Ashkenazi and the Khazars, who are Caucasian Babylonian Talmudic practitioners who infiltrated and took over Judaism. This renders their claim to Israel moot, and proves that the Jews who appear white are Jews in name only. Those same Jews are the ones who infiltrate positions of power in order to pervert them.\nJust................................................................................................................................................................................................................... I know what it sounds like, but I think that there might be people without the inborn life-giving spirit of God, who must then steal it from others, and who use God's \"chosen\" people to hide behind (I know many very good Jews).. The bible speaks of Satan and his host being cast to earth in the form of man, during which time they mated with man and created the Nephilim, or \"golems\" as some call them. Many Rabbis say this themselves.\n\nSo yeah ok just typing that out makes me feel bad, but I got here from a love of Browning's poetry, and I did not want to believe this at all. I just sat down and did my research, and it's by no means complete, but here are the threads I'm trying to tie together. There's so much, and it's seemingly been a fascination with great artists and heads of state and authors throughout history, yet we have never heard of it.. Benjamin Franklin said something like \"Gentlemen, were we to gift the Jew with Palestine, they would immediately conjure reasons for not returning, for they are a race of vampires, and they cannot feed among themselves.\" He was talking about their economic and social proclivities, but I use it to suggest that they mythos of vampirism is linked with Jewishness, or, derogatory perceptions of Jewishness.\n\nSo, there it all is.

{"author": "islammuslims", "body": "&gt;You\u2019re making the mistake of assuming that the quality of schools doesn\u2019t go up when you have slightly or significantly higher IQ populations present to build and maintain those institutions. I\u2019m sure there are colleges in South Africa that are filled with a ridiculous amount of white people, enough to make blacks there jealous of Afrikaners, but it would be a mistake for them to deport white people to Norway.\n\nYou're making the mistake of not proving your claim about schools getting \"better\". Schools are as good as the students there. Will schools get better average standardized test results if Jews and Asians go there- yes, IF they wouldn't otherwise have been replaced by whites with equivalent IQs. But does it really matter? Who cares if standardized test scores go down a bit if it means whites are getting more opportunities for higher education. And what would likely happen is that whites would replace Jews and Asians at top tier schools and everyone would sort of filter up to \"better\" schools and there would be no drop in test scores. There might be less people in higher education, but again who cares? More job opportunities for whites when they get out. \n\nIf Norway would accept Afrikaner refugees, that would be a great solution. Those n****** won't be deporting anyone- they'll be decapitating them. But let's be honest- is getting the Afrikaner students out of higher education in their perceived ethnic interest? Yes. The difference is they can't keep the power on without whites. Whites can do anything without Jews and Asians, the only difference is who's getting the paycheck at the end of the day. \n\n&gt;You should also consider what happens when you, by virtue of raising the student body\u2019s average IQ, increase the benefits that those people bring to the natives. Ultimately genius whites will be genius whites no matter if they are at the top or upper middle of their class. With competition from higher IQ demographics, as a result, you get the best of those people and the best of Asians and Jews as your public workforce. White people benefit as a whole economically speaking even if it means they take an ego boost.\n\nIf the economy was the only thing that mattered I wouldn't be a white nationalist. Although the current demographic trends will surely wreck our economy. \n\n&gt;Now, that doesn\u2019t take into account social strife and internal ethnic conflict, nor does it mean you need to bring these people into your community or attempt to \u201clearn and tolerate their culture\u201d. But in the case of Jews, it\u2019s much easier to understand why they would integrate a lot more than say, Asians, given how many don\u2019t even intend to raise their children as Jews this next generation and how hard and tedious it is to try and train your eye for surnames and nose types.\n\nWhat does it actually mean to raise your child as a Jew? Because over 70% of Jews said that the most important thing about being Jewish is remembering the Holocaust. Aka this is the one thing above all others that sets me ethnically apart from the goyim. As long as Jewish children are still being raised along these lines it doesn't matter much if they have barmitzvahs.

I never said he's trash, I stated that he wasn't at the same level lyrically which is undeniable.\n\n\n&gt; It's not simplifying anything, you're trying way too hard to discredit what he's saying by your narrow analysis.\n\nA lot in that quotation yet little substance. You didn't actually attempt to tell me how I was wrong or even how my analysis was \"narrow\". Instead, because you were unable to refute my points you resorted to childish name calling. Keep it on the playground.\n\n\n&gt; Yes, but the key phrase here is \"drug money.\"\n\nSo I'm not his \"specific audience\" (terminology you used earlier, too specific would be more apt in my opinion however) unless I already have a substantial amount of \"drug money\". It seems like that is quite a limiting factor for a song that is meant to be giving **me the listener** \"a million dollars worth of game for $9.99\".\n\n&gt; And the \"rinse\" lyric clearly alludes to some form of laundering so there probably would be some established system down that line.\n\nGreat so Jay is encouraging me to carry out a criminal offence that can result in **35 years in prison** and fines of **twice what I earned**. Really a great positive message, it's always great to encourage criminal activity. (Also note he doesn't even explain how to do it, so I have to find out how myself. Just like everything else in this song.)\n\n\n&gt; Jay is using his experiences to outline his regrets and he hopes others would learn from it.\n\nYes because we can all learn from not buying a **2 million dollar house** and instead purchasing a **v12 engine sports car**. The problem that I'm highlighting here is that this is not relatable **at all**.\n\n\n&gt; You don't have to buy million dollar paintings, but you can be more aware of investing wisely and building your credit.\n\nSo wouldn't it make far more sense to focus on investments the average person can make? If it is your true intention to highlight the importance of investing surely you could help people to start by offering some usable tips. To me this entire song functions better as a humble brag than actually educating the masses, sorry I meant the \"distinct audience\" of well established drug dealers.\n\n\n&gt; Thinking it's bigoted is different from your initial retort of \"and Jewish people don't own all the property in America.\"\n\nBecause when someone in Jay's position says ignorant things like this, people believe him. Jay wasn't making a point that this is a poor view to hold, no instead it appears this was meant as a compliment but rather it simply showed that he isn't informed enough to make these comments.\n\n\n&gt; And that's the point, these exaggerations are also present in the video.\n\nI never criticised the use of formally offensive images used to belittle the black race because he is reclaiming and re-purposing them.\n\n\n&gt; This isn't Jay saying \"the Jews are ruining everything\"\n\nRead my past point to get my view on this. Jay clearly intended it as a compliment but instead he just put forward a dangerous stereotype associated with numerous anti-semitic conspiracy theories.\n\n\n&gt; It's him outlining another disenfranchised group and attempting to instil certain values in the black community.\n\nA brief look at history will show you that these \"values\" are a result of Christian nations in Europe being against charging interest and so Jews were painted as devils for doing so. Characters like Shakespeare's Shylock in *the Merchant of Venice*, portray a greedy Jew fixated on money and this view was common at the time. Now interest isn't frowned upon but the legacy of these assertions still remain. To ignore this is to ignore history. You can \"instil certain values\" but you don't need to link it to an anti-semitic stereotype, there's no need for that.\n\n\n&gt; It was through both and to say otherwise is ignoring facts.\n\nTell me honestly whether you believe Jay's rapping or business acumen was more important in getting him into a position of wealth, **not his current position**. If this song is about bridging the gap between relative poverty and wealth, we should judge how Jay crossed this gap. It was by rapping. How he got to the level he is now is through business, but he built a foundation from which he was able to go to the next level by rapping. Unless the \"distinct audience\" is now all of a sudden is **upper class** then his experiences are irrelevant.\n__________________________________________________________________\nedit:\n\nTo fully prove my final point I'll state this logical proof. Jay states that he regrets buying v12 engine sports cars when he could buy a 2 million dollar house. This implicitly states that **he wasn't following these tips on his own come up**. You cannot tell me that you aren't wealthy if you can afford 2 million dollar houses with cash to spare and if he wasn't following these *genius* business strategies, then surely this proves his initial wealth came from rap. **He bridged the gap, not through these \"tips\" but through his rap career**.\n\n\n\nedit 2:\n\nTypos", "score": 0, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Kanye", "date_year_month": "2018-03", "created_utc_converted": "2018-03-18 03:23:41", "score_overall": 4, "words": "jewish conspiracy merchant jew", "shared_words": "jewish conspiracy merchant jew", "socre_distint": 4}

I guess if you wanted to you could technically try to argue that his antisemitism might be justified if he's right (lol) but it'd still be antisemitism\n\n&gt;Says nothing about genetic variables\n\nisn't relevant, because it's still antisemitism if it's not based on genetics (but it probably is considering who we're talking about). JF is in fact open about the fact that he thinks that t\n\n&gt;says nothing about hating jews. \n\nit is by the dictionary definition antisemitic to make such claims about the jewish people. if you want to argue that while JF is an antisemite who loves to hang out with people who deny the holocaust (but wish it really *did* happen), he might not technically **hate** jews - and consider that a win because we can't exactly prove what his innermost beliefs are, then... yeah, knock yourself out with that one. big win for the marketplace of ideas\n\n&gt;Like this isn't even a debate, this is like you getting repeatedly stomped while you're trying to figure out where you are.\n\nhmm, yes\n\n&gt;I go by logic\n\nhe might think jews are inferior creatures with no moral backbone, but I bet he doesn't hate them!

In the past I wanted all of this land without any Israelis. Today, I also accept the Israelis.\"\n\nSo in the past, he wanted to ethnically cleanse the Israelis, but now he is fine with them living there provided they don't get national self-determination.\n\n[A Time Magazine article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/magazine/is-this-where-the-third-intifada-will-start.html) about Bassem documents how \"In 1993, Bassem told me, his cousin Said Tamimi killed a settler near Ramallah. Eight years later, another villager, Ahlam Tamimi escorted a bomber to a Sbarro pizzeria in Jerusalem. Fifteen people were killed, eight of them minors. Ahlam, who now lives in exile in Jordan, and Said, who is in prison in Israel, remain much-loved in Nabi Saleh.\"\n\nAhlam has since been released from prison and is adamant that she doesn't regret the suicide bombing that killed seven children. [Her wiki page is well source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahlam_Tamimi)\n\nThe Time piece says, \"a pilgrimage to Nabi Saleh has achieved a measure of cachet among young European activists, the way a stint with the Zapatistas did in Mexico in the 1990s.\"\n\nThe Zapatistas were armed rebels, by the way. You've done what others have done every week for years, go hang out with Bassem and his regularly scheduled confrontations with the Israelis.\n\nI could go on, but I think I proved my point. Bassem doesn't support two states living in peace. He wants an end to Israel's existence with a Greater Palestine built in its place.\n\n&gt; So when we went to a desolate spring and held signs for a demonstration\n\nDesolate? It is far from the Palestinian town, but is close to the Israeli one. As I showed in my NPR link from my original comment, the spring was turned into a well and picnic area by the Israelis, they are the ones who use it. Your group went there (was led there) looking for trouble. Knowing that Israelis would show up to use the spring.\n\n&gt; The fact that you're so concerned with the Tamimi's reactions to the occupation, RATHER THAN THE OCCUPATION, is telling. \n\nI want the occupation to end.

That it was obvious satire only highlights the absurdity of it all. However, hate speech laws are not the product of some vast Jewish conspiracy theory; they are a reflection of most countries' disdain for free speech, and an overcorrection in response to the Holocaust. They are sometimes used against anti-semites, but quite often used to attack anybody who dares speak offensive truths, like that Muhammad was a genocidal pedophile. The sad fact is that the US is one of the only countries that believes mere hate speech without action deserves legal protection. And we Jews are far too few in number to set the policy of every other developed nation in the entire world that has this anti-liberty policy.

Is it hyperbolic? Yes, in that they weren't being mass-murdered yet. However, Jews had been stripped of all rights as German citizens a year earlier with the Nuremberg laws.\n\n* One is from 1941, and is presumably arguing about American intervention in the war, specifically about \"avoid[ing] the likelihood of another holocaust.\" Whether this is specifically talking about Jews, civilians, or American soldiers dying en masse is unclear.\n\n* The third is from a speech by a Rabbi in 1942 about Hitler's mass murder, the first instance in the article you linked of using the word 'holocaust' to describe the Nazis' murders: \"Authenticated reports point to 2,000,000 Jews who have already been slain by all manner of satanic barbarism, and plans for the total extermination of all Jews upon whom the Nazis can lay their hands.

{"approved_by": null, "author": "commiespaceinvader", "banned_by": null, "body": "**Part 1**\n\nOh man, this is neither a particularly simple question, nor will this most likely be a particularly short answer but here it goes:\n\nSo, as I mentioned in the original answer you linked, Moishe Postone is (or rather was unfortunately since he died recently) an adherent of a Marxist tendency called value criticism. Value Critics want to shift the focus in Marxian theories from class relations and struggle to a focus on Marx's analysis of commodity fetishism. Commodity Fetishism posits that the social relations between people are not understood as relations between people but as relations between economic objects in the sense that Capitalism transforms them into relations understood as economic. It reduces human interaction to relations between objects and their value. As Marx writes: \n\n&gt; the commodity-form, and the value-relation of the products of labour within which it appears, have absolutely no connection with the physical nature of the commodity and the material relations arising out of this. It is nothing but the definite social relation between men themselves which assumes here, for them, the fantastic form of a relation between things. In order, therefore, to find an analogy we must take flight into the misty realm of religion. There the products of the human brain appear as autonomous figures endowed with a life of their own, which enter into relations both with each other and with the human race. So it is in the world of commodities with the products of men's hands. I call this the fetishism which attaches itself to the products of labour as soon as they are produced as commodities, and is therefore inseparable from the production of commodities.\n\nCapitalism according to value critics is a form of indirect rule of the abstract relationship of value production that pervades both how society is organized as well as reproduced in the way we subjectively perceive the world. As long as our economic production process is focused on producing abstract value \u2013 a subjective aspect transformed into an objective one and a phenomenon different from the use-value of a commodity \u2013 we will never be free for we are only able to perceive ourselves and others in terms of their economic worth, of their value within the sphere of Capitalist circulation. Human needs according to the value critics need to be met not via a system of value, money, and production but in different forms that are oriented along the lines of real needs of the people and take into account human relations that are not based upon their position in the value production process.\n\nThis is important for Postone in as far as in his article [*Anti-Semitism and National Socialism*](https://libcom.org/library/anti-semitism-national-socialism-moishe-postone), which has become something of a classic among certain parts of especially the German Left, he tries to understand Nazi anti-Semitism with the help of the analytical tools set forth by value criticism.\n\nWhen he sets out to do so he identifies a set of characteristics unique to modern anti-Semitism: Its nature as a conspiracy theory, the fact that the Jew as the other is at the same time powerful as well as inferior, the perceived heightened danger that originated not just from Jews' alleged barbarity but also from their supposed control of both Capitalism, Communism, and Social Democracy. So far so good, this all being rather standard stuff when trying to grasp the phenomenon of modern anti-Semitism. Postone then sets out to explain these elements in a comprehensive fashion because according to him, other theories from Horkheimer to George Mosse have insufficiently explained how the Nazis' anti-Semitism is able to perceive the Jews as the dangerous forces behind modernity \u2013 Capitalism, Communism \u2013 and yet be so affirmative of modernity and a continuation of capitalist modes of production itself. In essence, how can the Nazis on the one hand reject modernity as a Jewish-driven scheme and romanticist certain elements of an imagined pre-modern life and at the same time be so affirmative of modernity and capitalism.\n\nHis answer is, naturally, because of commodity fetishism. Taking the distinction of use-value of a commodity (literally the value of its use realized upon consumption) and abstract value of a commodity (how much it is worth within the sphere of circulation), Postone posits that the Nazis' specific conception of the commodity fetish sees industrial capital as the continuation of use- and labor-value, writing:\n\n&gt; On the logical level of capital, the \u201cdouble character\u201d (labor process and valorization process) allows industrial production to appear as a purely material, creative process, separable from capital. The manifest form of the concrete is now more organic. Industrial capital then can appear as the linear descendent of \u201cnatural\u201d artisanal labor, as \u201corganically rooted,\u201d in opposition to \u201crootless,\u201d \u201cparasitic\u201d finance capital.\n&gt;\n&gt; The organization of the former appears related to that of the guild; its social context is grasped as a superordinate organic unity: Community (Gemeinschaft), Volk, Race. Capital itself\u2014or what is understood as the negative aspect of capitalism\u2014is understood only in terms of the manifest form of its abstract dimension: finance and interest capital. In this sense, the biological interpretation, which opposes the concrete dimension (of capitalism) as \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201chealthy\u201d to the negativity of what is taken to be \u201ccapitalism,\u201d does not stand in contradiction to a glorification of industrial capital and technology. Both are the \u201cthingly\u201d side of the antinomy. This relationship is commonly misunderstood.\n\nWith this glorification of Industrial capital as natural and artisanal comes the opposition to the \"unnatural\" and \"parasitic\" industrial capital of which Postone writes:\n\n&gt; This form of \u201canticapitalism,\u201d then, is based on a one-sided attack on the abstract. The abstract and concrete are not seen as constituting an antinomy where the real overcoming of the abstract\u2014of the value dimension\u2014involves the historical overcoming of the antinomy itself as well as each of its terms. Instead there is the one-sided attack on abstract reason, abstract law, or, at another level, money and finance capital. In this sense it is antinomically complementary to liberal thought, where the domination of the abstract remains unquestioned and the distinction between positive and critical reason is not made.\n&gt;\n&gt; The \u201canticapitalist\u201d attack, however, did not remain limited to the attack against abstraction. On the level of the capital fetish, it is not only the concrete side of the antinomy which can be naturalized and biologized. The manifest abstract dimension was also biologized\u2014as the Jews. The fetishized opposition of the concrete material and the abstract, of the \u201cnatural\u201d and the \u201cartificial,\u201d became translated as the world-historically significant racial opposition of the Aryans and the Jews. Modern anti-Semitism involves a biologization of capitalism\u2014which itself is only understood in terms of its manifest abstract dimension\u2014as International Jewry.\n\nMeaning that Jews were not only identified with money, in Nazi ideology they became the biological manifestation of capitalism \u2013 int he Nazis' conception sans industrial capital and technology \u2013 but the the personifications of the intangible, destructive, immensely powerful, and international domination of capital as an alienated social form. Overcoming \"negative\" Capitalism for the Nazis hence involved overcoming the Jews as concrete people.\n\nThis according to Postone is manifest in Auschwitz about which he writes:\n\n&gt; A capitalist factory is a place where value is produced, which \u201cunfortunately\u201d has to take the form of the production of goods, of use-values. The concrete is produced as the necessary carrier of the abstract. The extermination camps were not a terrible version of such a factory but, rather, should be seen as its grotesque, Aryan, \u201canticapitalist\u201d negation. Auschwitz was a factory to \u201cdestroy value,\u201d that is, to destroy the personifications of the abstract. Its organization was that of a fiendish industrial process, the aim of which was to \u201cliberate\u201d the concrete from the abstract. The first step was to dehumanize, that is, to rip away the \u201cmask\u201d of humanity, of qualitative specificity, and reveal the Jews for what \u201cthey really are\u201d\u2014shadows, ciphers, numbered abstractions. The second step was to then eradicate that abstractness, to transform it into smoke, trying in the process to wrest away the last remnants of the concrete material \u201cuse-value\u201d: clothes, gold, hair, soap.\n\nSo, this is in essence Postone's conception of anti-Semitism: Nazi anti-Semitism ascribes in the Jews the same characteristics that are ascribed to abstract value \u2013 abstraction, invisibility, automation, impersonal domination \u2013 while it celebrates the characteristics ascribed to concrete value \u2013 being natural, sound, true \u2013 in the non-Jewish races. For Postone, the opposition between the concrete and the abstract determined by social forms pervades all forms of subjectivity and thus the Holocaust becomes a project in destroying the abstract \u2013 technology being used to set up factories for the destruction of the people perceived as the embodiment of abstract value.\n\n\n\n\n", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh man, this is neither a particularly simple question, nor will this most likely be a particularly short answer but here it goes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, as I mentioned in the original answer you linked, Moishe Postone is (or rather was unfortunately since he died recently) an adherent of a Marxist tendency called value criticism. Value Critics want to shift the focus in Marxian theories from class relations and struggle to a focus on Marx&amp;#39;s analysis of commodity fetishism. Commodity Fetishism posits that the social relations between people are not understood as relations between people but as relations between economic objects in the sense that Capitalism transforms them into relations understood as economic. It reduces human interaction to relations between objects and their value. As Marx writes: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the commodity-form, and the value-relation of the products of labour within which it appears, have absolutely no connection with the physical nature of the commodity and the material relations arising out of this. It is nothing but the definite social relation between men themselves which assumes here, for them, the fantastic form of a relation between things. In order, therefore, to find an analogy we must take flight into the misty realm of religion. There the products of the human brain appear as autonomous figures endowed with a life of their own, which enter into relations both with each other and with the human race. So it is in the world of commodities with the products of men&amp;#39;s hands. I call this the fetishism which attaches itself to the products of labour as soon as they are produced as commodities, and is therefore inseparable from the production of commodities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Capitalism according to value critics is a form of indirect rule of the abstract relationship of value production that pervades both how society is organized as well as reproduced in the way we subjectively perceive the world. As long as our economic production process is focused on producing abstract value \u2013 a subjective aspect transformed into an objective one and a phenomenon different from the use-value of a commodity \u2013 we will never be free for we are only able to perceive ourselves and others in terms of their economic worth, of their value within the sphere of Capitalist circulation.

Not all of evolution is a slow biological process. Entire tribes or villages can die off due to lack of resources, or disease, changing the genetic makeup of a group of people overnight. Do you think it took millions of years for sickle-cell anemia to become prominent in Africa? No, malaria happened and everyone without the sickle-cell gene just died off. These things can happen VERY quickly, over a few generations. Just to give you one example, who do you think got killed in the holocaust? The poor Jews or the wealthy Jews?\n\nOn the \"rapid rise in African America I.Q.\"... First of all, this rise doesn't exist. You are maybe referring to the Flynn effect, which is a \"rapid\" rise in the I.Q.s of everyone. The black-white I.Q. gap hasn't closed a significant amount. But I guess you are trying to say that this is due to environmental factors, which is a valid hypothesis, but that increase in I.Q. is going to be inherited by the children of whoever got smarter. Culture is heritable.\n\n&gt;because it's not their jewishness that's the relevant variable here..? he's saying that because of cultural reasons jews are more likely to end up in that category. if you have any understanding of statistics at all you understand that if a group is moderately overrepresented in a certain variable on average, that the extremes tend to be dominated by those groups. in other words, your average black person might only be a bit taller than your average hispanic person, but if you look at the top 0.1% tallest people on earth, there are going to be a ton more black people in there because of how statistical distributions are laid out. I'm sure you're familiar with the bell curve - in this case I'm talking about the statistical model and not the book though.\n\nI have already explicitly acknowledged this so I don't know what you are rambling on about. I know perfectly well how normal distributions work. By the way, the tallest people are white. the top 0.1% tallest people are going to be mostly white (per capita anyway).\n\nBut my point is that a lot of these problems are specific to Jews. If the Zionists didn't exists you'd have trillions of dollars NOT spent on jerking off Jews in the middle east that you could have used for whatever other shitty policies you support.\n\n&gt;conspiracies require active cooperation, you know that right?\n\nDo you think all of the 10s of thousands of people who work for google get together every morning and go \"alright guys, let's work together to make the corporation more money\"? Or do they just kind of know what they have to do to further the goals of their group?\n\n&gt;you're now comparing a conspiracy that a few dozen, maybe few hundred people were in on, to a conspiracy that spans across millions of people that don't know each other. the latter is patently insane, and the former still leaked despite its infinitesimal size relative to that of the jewish population\n\nThe AIPAC has 100,000 members yet no one gives a shit about them. They circumvent all rules that other nations have to adhere to as far as lobbying goes. And their entire purpose is to funnel YOUR tax dollars into Israel. And what do they spend the money on? More lobbying power. It's a vampiric scheme that only serves to extract money out of your pockets and into theirs. This isn't some \"conspiracy\". That's literally what this is.\n\nHow about the fact that 98-ish percent of black Americans voted for Obama? Is that a conspiracy too? Oh shit, how didn't whitey find out, how could these 10s of millions of black people come together to conduct a power-grab on the most powerful nation on earth?\n\n&gt;this is a really dumb argument though. what does the average jew have to do with this policy? literally nothing, they have zero say in it. so right off the bat, if you hate \"jews\" as a group for this, your brain doesn't work. it's akin to hating North Korean citizens (might as well call them hostages) because the North Korean government is fucked up\n\nWho said I hate Jews? You know, I bet if I was droning on and on about how the Russians were influencing American politics, you would have said \"right on\", and not \"not all Russians!\". I \"hate\" the elites who orchestrate these things and exploit the American taxpayers they control just as much regardless of what race they are. It just so happens that a lot of them are Jewish, and that the Jewish problem is distinct, and bigger than other problems as far as this whole thing goes. Think of the worst policy matter that's relevant and being talked about in the media right now. Maybe steel tariffs or something? Oh no, the U.S. economy might shrink by a few billion over a decade or two at worst. It's not even on the same scale as all of the middle east shit the Jews drag us into. The U.S. gives Israel 3 billion in direct military aid each year.

Not all of evolution is a slow biological process. Entire tribes or villages can die off due to lack of resources, or disease, changing the genetic makeup of a group of people overnight. Do you think it took millions of years for sickle-cell anemia to become prominent in Africa? No, malaria happened and everyone without the sickle-cell gene just died off. These things can happen VERY quickly, over a few generations. Just to give you one example, who do you think got killed in the holocaust? The poor Jews or the wealthy Jews?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the &amp;quot;rapid rise in African America I.Q.&amp;quot;... First of all, this rise doesn&amp;#39;t exist. You are maybe referring to the Flynn effect, which is a &amp;quot;rapid&amp;quot; rise in the I.Q.s of everyone. The black-white I.Q. gap hasn&amp;#39;t closed a significant amount. But I guess you are trying to say that this is due to environmental factors, which is a valid hypothesis, but that increase in I.Q. is going to be inherited by the children of whoever got smarter. Culture is heritable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;because it&amp;#39;s not their jewishness that&amp;#39;s the relevant variable here..? he&amp;#39;s saying that because of cultural reasons jews are more likely to end up in that category. if you have any understanding of statistics at all you understand that if a group is moderately overrepresented in a certain variable on average, that the extremes tend to be dominated by those groups. in other words, your average black person might only be a bit taller than your average hispanic person, but if you look at the top 0.1% tallest people on earth, there are going to be a ton more black people in there because of how statistical distributions are laid out. I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;re familiar with the bell curve - in this case I&amp;#39;m talking about the statistical model and not the book though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have already explicitly acknowledged this so I don&amp;#39;t know what you are rambling on about. I know perfectly well how normal distributions work. By the way, the tallest people are white. the top 0.1% tallest people are going to be mostly white (per capita anyway).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But my point is that a lot of these problems are specific to Jews. If the Zionists didn&amp;#39;t exists you&amp;#39;d have trillions of dollars NOT spent on jerking off Jews in the middle east that you could have used for whatever other shitty policies you support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;conspiracies require active cooperation, you know that right?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you think all of the 10s of thousands of people who work for google get together every morning and go &amp;quot;alright guys, let&amp;#39;s work together to make the corporation more money&amp;quot;? Or do they just kind of know what they have to do to further the goals of their group?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;you&amp;#39;re now comparing a conspiracy that a few dozen, maybe few hundred people were in on, to a conspiracy that spans across millions of people that don&amp;#39;t know each other. the latter is patently insane, and the former still leaked despite its infinitesimal size relative to that of the jewish population&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The AIPAC has 100,000 members yet no one gives a shit about them. They circumvent all rules that other nations have to adhere to as far as lobbying goes. And their entire purpose is to funnel YOUR tax dollars into Israel. And what do they spend the money on? More lobbying power. It&amp;#39;s a vampiric scheme that only serves to extract money out of your pockets and into theirs. This isn&amp;#39;t some &amp;quot;conspiracy&amp;quot;. That&amp;#39;s literally what this is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How about the fact that 98-ish percent of black Americans voted for Obama? Is that a conspiracy too? Oh shit, how didn&amp;#39;t whitey find out, how could these 10s of millions of black people come together to conduct a power-grab on the most powerful nation on earth?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;this is a really dumb argument though. what does the average jew have to do with this policy? literally nothing, they have zero say in it. so right off the bat, if you hate &amp;quot;jews&amp;quot; as a group for this, your brain doesn&amp;#39;t work. it&amp;#39;s akin to hating North Korean citizens (might as well call them hostages) because the North Korean government is fucked up&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who said I hate Jews? You know, I bet if I was droning on and on about how the Russians were influencing American politics, you would have said &amp;quot;right on&amp;quot;, and not &amp;quot;not all Russians!&amp;quot;. I &amp;quot;hate&amp;quot; the elites who orchestrate these things and exploit the American taxpayers they control just as much regardless of what race they are. It just so happens that a lot of them are Jewish, and that the Jewish problem is distinct, and bigger than other problems as far as this whole thing goes. Think of the worst policy matter that&amp;#39;s relevant and being talked about in the media right now. Maybe steel tariffs or something? Oh no, the U.S. economy might shrink by a few billion over a decade or two at worst. It&amp;#39;s not even on the same scale as all of the middle east shit the Jews drag us into. The U.S. gives Israel 3 billion in direct military aid each year. And that&amp;#39;s not even mentioning all the indirect money that America spends there, like the, literally trillions, of dollars spent on Iraq.

For instance, someone who claims to have had an encounter with a supernatural being or alien may present a very vivid story, but this is not falsifiable. This phenomenon can also happen to large groups of people through subjective validation.\n\n&gt;&gt;Anecdotal evidence is also frequently misinterpreted via the availability heuristic, which leads to an overestimation of prevalence. Where a cause can be easily linked to an effect, people overestimate the likelihood of the cause having that effect (availability). In particular, vivid, emotionally charged anecdotes seem more plausible, and are given greater weight. A related issue is that it is usually impossible to assess for every piece of anecdotal evidence, the rate of people not reporting that anecdotal evidence in the population.\n\n&gt;&gt;A common way anecdotal evidence becomes unscientific is through fallacious reasoning such as the Post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, the human tendency to assume that if one event happens after another, then the first must be the cause of the second. Another fallacy involves inductive reasoning. For instance, if an anecdote illustrates a desired conclusion rather than a logical conclusion, it is considered a faulty or hasty generalization.[11] For example, here is anecdotal evidence presented as proof of a desired conclusion:\n\n&gt;&gt;There's abundant proof that drinking water cures cancer. Just last week I read about a girl who was dying of cancer. After drinking water she was cured.\n\n&gt;&gt;Anecdotes like this do not prove anything. In any case where some factor affects the probability of an outcome, rather than uniquely determining it, selected individual cases prove nothing; e.g. \"my grandfather smoked 40 a day until he died at 90\" and \"my sister never went near anyone who smoked but died of lung cancer\". Anecdotes often refer to the exception, rather than the rule: \"Anecdotes are useless precisely because they may point to idiosyncratic responses.\"\n\n&gt;&gt;More generally, a statistical correlation between things does not in itself prove that one causes the other (a causal link). A study found that television viewing was strongly correlated with sugar consumption, but this does not prove that viewing causes sugar intake (or vice versa).\n\n&gt;&gt;In medicine anecdotal evidence is also subject to placebo effects:[14] it is well-established that a patient's (or doctor's) expectation can genuinely change the outcome of treatment. Only double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials can confirm a hypothesis about the effectiveness of a treatment independently of expectations.\n\n&gt;&gt;By contrast, in science and logic, the \"relative strength of an explanation\" is based upon its ability to be tested or repeated, proven to be due to the stated cause, and verifiable under neutral conditions in a manner that other researchers will agree has been performed competently, and can check for themselves.\n\nEspecially when that's all the evidence you have.\n\n&gt;Multiple examples of Labour members,\n\nThere's over 500,000 Labour members. Even if there's 1000 examples from 1000 different members do you understand what a tiny number that is in the scheme of the entire Labour Party?\n\n&gt; some that their leader appears with or supports\n\nSuch as?\n\n&gt; being incredibly anti-Semitic (denying the Holocaust, 9/11 &amp; Jews being money-obsessed or controlling the world-type conspiracies) is evidence that you cannot simply ignore.\n\nI know people hold these views but it's not exactly mainstream is it?\n\n&gt;you're clutching at straws. To say that Hitler supported Zionism because of that is deeply wrong and offensive.\n\nMy only point is that it's not conspiracy it's undeniable that Hitler did have a view for a homeland for Jewish people. \n\n&gt;What are you even on about? I'm not suggesting we go all Nuremberg on Livingstone...\n\nWas in reply to your comment saying \n\n&gt;&gt;If your red line for doing something about these people is that they have to be explicitly screaming that they hate Jews, then you should probably take a long look at yourself and your prejudices.\n\n&gt;So? This is just whataboutism. I'll call out this kind of behaviour in any party. Labour claim to be better, but not taking action about these things does little to support that.\n\nIt's not whataboutism at all hahahah. I swear 99% of people use the phrase don't know what that means. You made a claim about Labour being a party \"rife\" with bigotry. I point out evidence to show it's actually the least bigoted party there is. Very much on subject. So not whataboutism. You're probably just annoyed that I provided proof to ruin your whole argument.\n\n&gt;Don't bother. I'm not wasting any more of my time on you.\n\nI wonder why? ", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh come on, a bunch of men with exaggerated large noses under an Illuminati symbol?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Noses are large, but that alone doesn&amp;#39;t scream anti-semitism to me. The illuminati symbol isn&amp;#39;t an anti-semitic symbol. So the only thing you&amp;#39;re telling it screams anti-semitism to you is large noses and a symbol that isn&amp;#39;t anti-semitic?

There&amp;#39;s nothing inherently wrong with anecdotal evidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you have issues with reading? I told you I looked up the account. It was nothing but retweeting but the same story over and over again but this time with a snarky tory commenting on it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anecdotal evidence is the worst kind of evidence there is. It&amp;#39;s known as a logical fallacy for a reason. There&amp;#39;s 570,000 Labour members and they received 12.7 million votes last year. I&amp;#39;m sure some people who are either Labour members or voters are bigoted people. But until you come up with statistical proof that shows that bigotry is &amp;quot;rife&amp;quot; in the Labour Party I&amp;#39;m just going to assume you&amp;#39;re wrong about your claim. Some old cunt from Rotherham who came from a working class Labour voting background with a hatred of some people isn&amp;#39;t going to influence my mind on all of Labour. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind as well unlike you I&amp;#39;ve provided statistical evidence to show that Labour voters are the least bigoted amongst all the major parties.

Corbyn, Seumas Milne and Andrew Murray do not enthusiastically endorse the gangsters in the Kremlin as their predecessors in the communist movement endorsed Lenin and Stalin. Corbyn did not say the Russians were innocent of the charge of using nerve agents to attempt murder in Salisbury. Instead, he gave Russian propagandists and his supporters in the world of Internet cranks just enough to work with when he opined that although Russia might have done it, \u2018Russian mafia-like groups that have been allowed to gain a toehold in Britain cannot be excluded\u2019.*\n\n*A few months ago, a friend who is also a successful stand-up told me that he was one of only four comedians on the circuit who did not support Corbyn. In  universities and the left-wing press those of us who have spoken out against the far left have grown used to being met with \u2013 how can I put this mildly? \u2013 a cool response from our colleagues. The assumption among right-thinking, left-leaning people is that they are good and wickedness is confined to the right. By this reasoning the worst charge that can be thrown at the far left is that is naively idealistic, a charge which, when you think about it, is no charge at all. By this reasoning, Corbyn is an amiable old buffer rather than a dirty old man.*\n\n*Such thinking can predominate because, until now, no one in British history has had to confront the reality of the far left in control of the Labour party, and perhaps soon the country. Most comedians have not satirised it, most academics, dramatists and journalists have not exposed it because until now there has been no need to take it seriously; no need to understand that the far left is not merely an extension of the centre left but a malign force that, as Momentum is proving, regards the centre-left as its avowed enemy.*\n\n*Perhaps as more is revealed about its darkness respectable opinion will change. Whether it will change in time is another matter. Maybe I am being pessimistic but it looks to me that the politics Corbyn represents are \u2018the left\u2019 now and will remain so for a generation.*", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joseph Goebbels said fascists should not worry about their propaganda being too rough or too mean. \u2018It ought not be decent nor ought it be gentle or soft or humble; it ought to lead to success.\u2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No one could accuse the anti-Semitic propaganda in London\u2019s East End of being \u2018soft\u2019.

Corbyn, Seumas Milne and Andrew Murray do not enthusiastically endorse the gangsters in the Kremlin as their predecessors in the communist movement endorsed Lenin and Stalin. Corbyn did not say the Russians were innocent of the charge of using nerve agents to attempt murder in Salisbury. Instead, he gave Russian propagandists and his supporters in the world of Internet cranks just enough to work with when he opined that although Russia might have done it, \u2018Russian mafia-like groups that have been allowed to gain a toehold in Britain cannot be excluded\u2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few months ago, a friend who is also a successful stand-up told me that he was one of only four comedians on the circuit who did not support Corbyn. In  universities and the left-wing press those of us who have spoken out against the far left have grown used to being met with \u2013 how can I put this mildly? \u2013 a cool response from our colleagues. The assumption among right-thinking, left-leaning people is that they are good and wickedness is confined to the right. By this reasoning the worst charge that can be thrown at the far left is that is naively idealistic, a charge which, when you think about it, is no charge at all. By this reasoning, Corbyn is an amiable old buffer rather than a dirty old man.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Such thinking can predominate because, until now, no one in British history has had to confront the reality of the far left in control of the Labour party, and perhaps soon the country. Most comedians have not satirised it, most academics, dramatists and journalists have not exposed it because until now there has been no need to take it seriously; no need to understand that the far left is not merely an extension of the centre left but a malign force that, as Momentum is proving, regards the centre-left as its avowed enemy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perhaps as more is revealed about its darkness respectable opinion will change. Whether it will change in time is another matter. Maybe I am being pessimistic but it looks to me that the politics Corbyn represents are \u2018the left\u2019 now and will remain so for a generation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "likes": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "saved": false, "score": -2, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "user_reports": [], "date_year_month": "2018-03", "created_utc_converted": "2018-03-24 18:42:39", "score_overall": 7, "words": "jewish jewish jewish holocaust libel conspiracy jewish", "shared_words": "jewish holocaust libel conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

We must stamp this out from our party and movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe recognise that anti-Semitism has occurred in pockets within the Labour Party, causing pain and hurt to our Jewish community in the Labour Party and the rest of the country. I am sincerely sorry for the pain which has been caused.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wes Streeting, the Labour MP, said: \u201cTo those who say there\u2019s no problem with anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, or that\u2019s it\u2019s being handled well, please ask why Britain\u2019s leading Jewish organisations are demonstrating to the Parliamentary Labour Party.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe should be ashamed that it\u2019s come to this.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gideon Falter, the chairman of the Campaign Against anti-Semitism, said: \u201cUnder Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party has been seized by racists. Jeremy Corbyn is at home amongst them, having spent his political career seeking out and giving his backing to Holocaust deniers, genocidal anti-Semitic terrorist groups, wild anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists and Jew-haters.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Karen Pollock, the chief executive of the Holocaust Education Trust, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Westminster Hour on Sunday night: \u201cAn apology about anti-Semitism within the Labour Party is important.

First of all, Gaius is closely linked to the practice of idolatry. The Roman writer Suetonius reports how Gaius \u201cset up a special temple to his own godhead, with priests and with victims of the choicest kind.\u201d Another Roman writer, Dio Cassius, comments negatively on how Gaius was the only emperor to claim to be divine and to be the recipient of worship during his own lifetime. Gaius also tried at one point to erect a statue of himself in the Temple in Jerusalem; he was dissuaded only by a delegation from Herod Agrippa. Hence the link between Gaius and idolatry would have been well-known indeed, particularly in Jewish circles. But Gaius also serves as \u201cExhibit A\u201d for out-of-control lust. Suetonius reports how Gaius \u201clived in perpetual incest with all his sisters, and at a large banquet he placed each of them in turn below him, while his wife reclined above.\u201d He records gruesome examples of Gaius\u2019s arbitrary violence, vindictiveness, and cruelty. Later, Suetonius chronicles Gaius\u2019s sexual liaisons with the wives of dinner guests, raping them in an adjoining room and then returning to the banquet to comment on their performance. Various same-sex sexual encounters between Gaius and other men are similarly recounted. Finally, a military officer whom he had sexually humiliated joined a conspiracy to murder him, which they did less than four years into his reign. Suetonius records that Gaius was stabbed through the genitals when he was murdered. One wonders whether we can hear an echo of this gruesome story in Paul\u2019s comments in Romans 1: 27: \u201cMen committed shameless acts with men and received in their own person the due penalty for their error.\u201d Gaius Caligula graphically illustrates the reality of which Paul speaks in Romans 1: the movement from idolatry to insatiable lust to every form of depravity, and the violent murderous reprisal that such behavior engenders.\n\n\n\nThe problem is, people have horrifically misunderstood two simple words in this ancient letter that St. Paul wrote to an early Christian community in the trade city of Corinth.\n\nThe words are: malakoi and arsenkoitai.\n\nMatthew goes on to define malakoi as \u201ceffeminate.\u201d It\u2019s a Greek word that literally means \u201csoft\u201d and is used to describe fine clothing elsewhere in the New Testament. In a moral context, this word is actually more about \u201clack of self-control, weakness, laziness, or cowardice.\u201d My friend David, a pastor who got kicked out of his church for false accusations, told me over nachos recently that this word is actually about people who were \u201cspineless.\u201d Soft to the point that they wouldn\u2019t stand up for injustice or what truly matters. Irony of ironies, huh?\n\nThere were sexual connotations for \u201cmalakoi\u201d as well, but again, it always points backs to uncontrolled acts of lust or misused sexuality\u200a\u2014\u200ano matter the gender or act. The word was not understood to reference same-sex behavior in the church until after the 20th century, when Bible translations adopted a new slant.\n\nArsenkoitai is more bizarre and hard to grasp. Many believe that St. Paul actually invented the word, as it is extremely rare in ancient Greek literature.\n\nThe word literally is a combination of two other words in Greek: arsen (male) and koites (bed). So, arsenkoitai could be translated literally as \u201cmale-bedders.\u201d And this word was understood by Bible translators before the 20th century to mean male-male sexual intercourse.\n\nBut when the word is used elsewhere in ancient Greek literature, it references the abuse of the poor (as in the Sibylline Oracles) or \u201ceconomic exploitation and power abuses (as in a 2nd century text called the Acts of John).\u201d The Acts of John lists arsenkoitai amongst a list of sins separate from a catalog of other sexual sins. Many believe (as Vines so cogently breaks down) that arsenkoitai is about economic abuses and exploitation.\n\nWhich is why the ancient act of \u201cpederasty\u201d is often brought up in relation to passages like this\u2014 the practice of Greek elite elder men who would adopt young men to use as sexual objects. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee how fun it is to examine historical context?\n\n\n_______________\n\n\n&gt;The Bible does not support slavery except as an act of war.\n\n\nNot even in act of war it's moral, you know what we do with people we capture during war? We don't keep them as slaves!\n\n&gt;The alternative was death to every person in a city that was wicked and went against God\n\nOr release them?\n\n\n&gt;Other than that, the Bible mediates slavery because it was an aspect of the culture, but it does not condone it\n\n\nOh really? What does the \"You can hold your slave's wife and child hostage and blackmail them to serving you forever with that\", why would a non condoning God give loopholes on how to enslave people further?\n\n&gt; Also, slavery as mentioned in the Bible was much different from what we think of today.\n\n\nNot this terrible excuse again, people were to take people as slaves and were allowed to buy them.\n\n&gt; Slavery, or bond servitude in first century Palestine was a voluntary way to get food and housing when one couldn't afford it.\n\n\nWrong, God said the people are their property.\n\n\n&gt;It was a voluntary alternative to being homeless and hungry.\n\n\nAgain, people were told they can buy slaves and keep them as property.\n", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;No, Paul does not condemn homosexuality because of any historical context.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you know?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Paul calls men who have sex with men wrongdoers&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idolatry, promiscuity and shrine prostitution are what Paul is addressing in Romans 1\u200a\u2014\u200anot same-sex relationships between faithful and committed partners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neil Elliott has called attention to the striking similarities between Paul\u2019s language and the incredible greed, violence, and sexual excesses of Gaius Caligula, an emperor who reigned in a period not too long before Paul wrote Romans.

The word was not understood to reference same-sex behavior in the church until after the 20th century, when Bible translations adopted a new slant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arsenkoitai is more bizarre and hard to grasp. Many believe that St. Paul actually invented the word, as it is extremely rare in ancient Greek literature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The word literally is a combination of two other words in Greek: arsen (male) and koites (bed). So, arsenkoitai could be translated literally as \u201cmale-bedders.\u201d And this word was understood by Bible translators before the 20th century to mean male-male sexual intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when the word is used elsewhere in ancient Greek literature, it references the abuse of the poor (as in the Sibylline Oracles) or \u201ceconomic exploitation and power abuses (as in a 2nd century text called the Acts of John).\u201d The Acts of John lists arsenkoitai amongst a list of sins separate from a catalog of other sexual sins. Many believe (as Vines so cogently breaks down) that arsenkoitai is about economic abuses and exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is why the ancient act of \u201cpederasty\u201d is often brought up in relation to passages like this\u2014 the practice of Greek elite elder men who would adopt young men to use as sexual objects. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See how fun it is to examine historical context?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Bible does not support slavery except as an act of war.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not even in act of war it&amp;#39;s moral, you know what we do with people we capture during war? We don&amp;#39;t keep them as slaves!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The alternative was death to every person in a city that was wicked and went against God&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or release them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Other than that, the Bible mediates slavery because it was an aspect of the culture, but it does not condone it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh really? What does the &amp;quot;You can hold your slave&amp;#39;s wife and child hostage and blackmail them to serving you forever with that&amp;quot;, why would a non condoning God give loopholes on how to enslave people further?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also, slavery as mentioned in the Bible was much different from what we think of today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not this terrible excuse again, people were to take people as slaves and were allowed to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Slavery, or bond servitude in first century Palestine was a voluntary way to get food and housing when one couldn&amp;#39;t afford it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wrong, God said the people are their property.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was a voluntary alternative to being homeless and hungry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, people were told they can buy slaves and keep them as property.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "likes": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "saved": false, "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Christianity", "user_reports": [], "date_year_month": "2018-03", "created_utc_converted": "2018-03-26 18:16:29", "score_overall": 4, "words": "greed jewish conspiracy cowardice", "shared_words": "greed jewish conspiracy cowardice", "socre_distint": 4}

In order to fully 'draw out' the blood, animal flesh is treated with a thick layer of salt after slaughter (hence, \"Kosher Salt\" at supermarkets). This... isn't very nice for beef, but acts something like a brine for poultry.\n\nI suppose it's an interesting historical question (which almost certainly could never be answered) if this curious gap in Shylock's contract drafting reflects Shakespeare's own lack of knowledge about the matter (certainly possible, I should doubt he had much cause to be familiar with Jewish customs), or is an intentional error meant to reflect Shylock's debasement as he seeks to emulate the 'villainy' he feels has been visited upon him. It's certainly worth pointing out that, though I make quibbles about moral differences, contract interpretation and that Shylock is getting screwed, Shylock's contract would be *expressly* forbidden under not just Jewish tradition, but under *Biblical law* (I think I mentioned, but perhaps did not emphasize, this previously). \n\nIn any case, I'm more interested in the differences between the Christian and Jewish moral structure, which you give an example of here;\n&gt;Leaving the play aside for a moment, I think this is a good way to approach the law. **There is no moral difference between an attempted murderer and an actual murderer**.

Let me address the ones I think I can.\n\n&gt; We're probably just ignorant\n\n\"Unaware\" would be my choice of word :) I feel \"ignorant\" might be a bit harsh.\n\n&gt; The issue arises if the artist doesn't disclose their identities, should it be considered antisemitic if we can't even tell if they're Jewish?\n\nIf they were intended to portray Jews as evil, then it *is* antisemitic. But if the artist doesn't tell us that (in the art or in any other way), we cannot know that.\n\nSo no: we cannot consider something antisemitic if there is no evidence that it might be.\n\nBut of course, the artist may let his clique know the true identities. Rumours would circulate. Antisemites would love it. Classic dogwhistling.\n\n&gt; What if the richest person in the world was Jewish, they were included in the imagery, but they were the only Jewish person there, included because they were the world's wealthiest individual. Would that also be considered antisemitic?\n\nIf there is a large group of other wealthy people of diverse backgrounds, I think the message is \"wealthy people\". Especially if the Jewish guy isn't portrayed with nazi-style stereotypes.\n\n&gt; What about if that person was Christian, Muslim, Hindu, no religion? Is it bigoted against any of those religions? \n\nIt absolutely could be, depending on the intended meaning. The main thing is that the art has to portray an *untrue* and *bad* thing about the group being represented. Claiming (for example) that Muslims advocate violence would be a comparable example, and certainly bigoted.\n\n&gt; If they're white is it racist against white people?\n\nCould be. Again, is the art casting that group into a demonising stereotype? If most rich businessmen are white then art showing white rich businessmen is not necessarily bigoted but just accurately portraying rich businessmen. It can even criticise this situation without being bigoted. It crosses the line when it becomes \"white men are\" or \"all businessmen are\" or \"the evil in the world is controlled by these few people despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary\".\n\nThe big difference with antisemitic art in particular is that there aren't so many traditional myths about other ethnic groups (at least in Europe). The Blood Libel, the International Jewish Conspiracy and so forth have led to violence against Jews for centuries. With the Holocaust still within living memory, I think that people might be more sensitive to anitsemitism. \n\n\n&gt; You're correct, people are going to make it as difficult as possible to identify bigotry. It's going to be a tough road ahead.\n\nYes, it is. Thank you for taking the time to read and engage.

Let me address the ones I think I can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re probably just ignorant&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Unaware&amp;quot; would be my choice of word :) I feel &amp;quot;ignorant&amp;quot; might be a bit harsh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The issue arises if the artist doesn&amp;#39;t disclose their identities, should it be considered antisemitic if we can&amp;#39;t even tell if they&amp;#39;re Jewish?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they were intended to portray Jews as evil, then it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; antisemitic. But if the artist doesn&amp;#39;t tell us that (in the art or in any other way), we cannot know that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So no: we cannot consider something antisemitic if there is no evidence that it might be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But of course, the artist may let his clique know the true identities. Rumours would circulate. Antisemites would love it. Classic dogwhistling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What if the richest person in the world was Jewish, they were included in the imagery, but they were the only Jewish person there, included because they were the world&amp;#39;s wealthiest individual. Would that also be considered antisemitic?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there is a large group of other wealthy people of diverse backgrounds, I think the message is &amp;quot;wealthy people&amp;quot;. Especially if the Jewish guy isn&amp;#39;t portrayed with nazi-style stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What about if that person was Christian, Muslim, Hindu, no religion? Is it bigoted against any of those religions? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It absolutely could be, depending on the intended meaning. The main thing is that the art has to portray an &lt;em&gt;untrue&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; thing about the group being represented. Claiming (for example) that Muslims advocate violence would be a comparable example, and certainly bigoted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If they&amp;#39;re white is it racist against white people?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be. Again, is the art casting that group into a demonising stereotype? If most rich businessmen are white then art showing white rich businessmen is not necessarily bigoted but just accurately portraying rich businessmen. It can even criticise this situation without being bigoted. It crosses the line when it becomes &amp;quot;white men are&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;all businessmen are&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the evil in the world is controlled by these few people despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The big difference with antisemitic art in particular is that there aren&amp;#39;t so many traditional myths about other ethnic groups (at least in Europe). The Blood Libel, the International Jewish Conspiracy and so forth have led to violence against Jews for centuries. With the Holocaust still within living memory, I think that people might be more sensitive to anitsemitism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re correct, people are going to make it as difficult as possible to identify bigotry. It&amp;#39;s going to be a tough road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is. Thank you for taking the time to read and engage.

{"approved_by": null, "author": "Crypto_To_The_Core", "banned_by": null, "body": "Here's the full article ....   just in case the site goes down again:\n\n\nExclusive to Davidicke.com: Street artist Mear One responds to 'anti-Semitic' painting hysteria\n  Mear One\n15 hours ago\n\n    Political Manipulation UK News Guest Content \n\n\nBy Mear One.\n\nI\u2019ve received nearly a dozen msm interview requests over the past several days. After falling into one of their traps early on, I decided the only platform, apart from my own, that I will choose to speak through is this one. I thank David Icke and Gareth Icke and their team for allowing me this opportunity to offer my side of the story, uncut and uncensored, for those who are awoken.\n\nIn October 2012 I travelled to London to paint a mural that has, once again, become the center of controversy and condemnation. I had just gone through the cypher of Occupy LA 2011 all the way to its violent end the night the LAPD rolled through to dismantle the protest. Over the course of this year-long movement my experiences helped to crystallize my post 9/11 thinking on global politics and the economic slave system, deepening my knowledge of fractional reserve lending and other banking schemes that led to the collapse of the markets in 2008. These facts began to find design in my mind and while on the flight to London I sketched out my plans for a mural inspired by these recent real world events. Art has always been my tool of communication to describe reality as I\u2019m living it, delving into politics, science and philosophy. Given the times we are living in today - rich getting richer, poor getting poorer - I felt the need to speak out about these crimes against humanity.\n\nMayer Amschel Rothschild once said, \u201cGive me control of a nation\u2019s money and I care not who makes the laws.\u201d Using this as my ideological starting point, I chose to depict the likenesses of such early turn of the century Robber Barons, specifically Rothschild, Rockefeller, Morgan, Carnegie, Warburg, as well Aleister Crowley who was a kind of philosophical guru to the ruling elite of that time and a well-known Satanist. These men and their dynasties, whom I believe don't subscribe to any reasonable human code of morality, have put parameters around what our reality consists of and are destroying our planet, indebting us in the trillions, profiting in the billions, while displacing millions, financing wars through illegal taxation. These wicked banksters have indeed been playing a game of monopoly on the backs of the working class. My mural evolved into a dark vision of an apocalyptic reality fueled by their greed, filling our skies with coal, nuclear and chemtrail pollution. I pulled further visual inspiration from the U.S. Dollar bill, which holds sacred Freemason iconography, such as the \"all seeing eye\", accompanied by cryptic Latin inscriptions like \u201cnovus ordo seclorum\u201d or \u201cnew order of the ages\u201d. There are several other hidden symbols, which some may argue have Jewish influences, such as the star configuration that rises above the eagle crest forming a two-dimensional tetrahedron, considered by some as the star of David, I always wondered why?\n\n\nDavid Icke's Sensational New Book\n\n\nThough there are strange iconographic images like the pyramid and stars, that doesn\u2019t mean I believe the system is Egyptian, anymore than I believe there is some Jewish conspiracy creating and controlling our money either. So to conflate my anti-capitalist message with anti-semitic rhetoric, as the UK politicians and their msm puppets have so adeptly accomplished, is very ill-intended and manipulative. Critics took liberty to pick and highlight my written words, which were based in actual fact, about how some of the older folk in the community who claimed to be Jewish came upon me while I was painting my mural and asked me who these characters were and when I replied they were aghast at how I could portray someone like Rothschild in such a wicked manner. They expressed to me all of the good deeds Rothschild had done for the Jewish community and the world at large. That\u2019s what they said! Also, for the record, I have never said anything about these characters representing anything more than greedy old European and American men in power. JP Morgan carried the look that interested me the most, that of a fat cat who perhaps had too much fine wine and rich food in his time. The cartoonish way these characters are depicted was inspiration I took directly from the monopoly game itself, knowing that I would only have but 3 days to gather supplies and complete my mural on a very limited personal budget before needing to continue on with my travels, which affected the degree to which I could execute these very complex men.\n\nIt was also their interpretation, and never mine, to point out \u201chook noses\" \"crooked noses\u201d and other vile Nazi, Third Reich anti-Semitic propaganda, even concocting cuckoo ideas like how the naked figures under the monopoly board depicted \"starving holocaust victims\u201d when they actually represent the multi-races of humanity! As a thinking feeling human being to hear such stuff makes me sick to my stomach. It is because fundamentally I see humans as a species, is that so hard to accept? I believe that our religious choices do not define us. These religions are like clothing and it is the choice of the wearer to wear what he or she wants. That should not separate us as humans who breathe the same air and bleed red. It is the financial division that I take issue with and feel its unnatural effects on those who should be family due to species. This is one planet and we are one people, Earth People. The fact is that some are highly uncomfortable with others and would use divisive acts to keep us separated, arguing over nonsense as they continue to rob and pillage the earth. This is the world I painted, it is the world we live in now, and this conversation is most important if we as a species are to make it to the next level of our evolution. But this conversation was halted, my mural vandalized live on the BBC by a businessman in a suit who spray painted the word haganah (a now defunct Jewish paramilitary organization) over it, the mural was eventually buffed, and the rest is history.\n\n\n\nI really don\u2019t have too much opinion on the labor party. Their recent decision to dig up this 6 year old controversy and violently drag my name and art through the mud was theirs to make and only time will tell if karma is ever something they\u2019ll have to deal with. All politicians are scum for all I care. With that said, I also have the utmost respect for the working class. My family is working class and artists and I have become self-reliant because of it. Growing up on welfare with a single mom in the seedy backlots of Hollywood throughout the Reagan/Thatcher years, getting my education in economics 101 from the streets of LA to Tokyo as a graffiti writer throughout the 90s, vandalizing city walls to find my voice, I have chosen my own path of freedom. I am an anarchist and over the past couple of years I have worked ardently to free myself from these statist shackles, radically disassociating from ideas that no longer serve their purpose. Change is coming and as a self-defense mechanism I believe that the new Crypto reality and blockchain technologies may be providing some answers. How do we get out from under the tyrannical grip of the banking globalists and corporations ruling our world? I believe it exists in the decentralization of our monetary system, but could we apply a bit of that thinking to our state of humanity as well? Can we decentralize humanity?

After falling into one of their traps early on, I decided the only platform, apart from my own, that I will choose to speak through is this one. I thank David Icke and Gareth Icke and their team for allowing me this opportunity to offer my side of the story, uncut and uncensored, for those who are awoken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In October 2012 I travelled to London to paint a mural that has, once again, become the center of controversy and condemnation. I had just gone through the cypher of Occupy LA 2011 all the way to its violent end the night the LAPD rolled through to dismantle the protest. Over the course of this year-long movement my experiences helped to crystallize my post 9/11 thinking on global politics and the economic slave system, deepening my knowledge of fractional reserve lending and other banking schemes that led to the collapse of the markets in 2008. These facts began to find design in my mind and while on the flight to London I sketched out my plans for a mural inspired by these recent real world events. Art has always been my tool of communication to describe reality as I\u2019m living it, delving into politics, science and philosophy. Given the times we are living in today - rich getting richer, poor getting poorer - I felt the need to speak out about these crimes against humanity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mayer Amschel Rothschild once said, \u201cGive me control of a nation\u2019s money and I care not who makes the laws.\u201d Using this as my ideological starting point, I chose to depict the likenesses of such early turn of the century Robber Barons, specifically Rothschild, Rockefeller, Morgan, Carnegie, Warburg, as well Aleister Crowley who was a kind of philosophical guru to the ruling elite of that time and a well-known Satanist. These men and their dynasties, whom I believe don&amp;#39;t subscribe to any reasonable human code of morality, have put parameters around what our reality consists of and are destroying our planet, indebting us in the trillions, profiting in the billions, while displacing millions, financing wars through illegal taxation. These wicked banksters have indeed been playing a game of monopoly on the backs of the working class. My mural evolved into a dark vision of an apocalyptic reality fueled by their greed, filling our skies with coal, nuclear and chemtrail pollution. I pulled further visual inspiration from the U.S. Dollar bill, which holds sacred Freemason iconography, such as the &amp;quot;all seeing eye&amp;quot;, accompanied by cryptic Latin inscriptions like \u201cnovus ordo seclorum\u201d or \u201cnew order of the ages\u201d. There are several other hidden symbols, which some may argue have Jewish influences, such as the star configuration that rises above the eagle crest forming a two-dimensional tetrahedron, considered by some as the star of David, I always wondered why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;David Icke&amp;#39;s Sensational New Book&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though there are strange iconographic images like the pyramid and stars, that doesn\u2019t mean I believe the system is Egyptian, anymore than I believe there is some Jewish conspiracy creating and controlling our money either. So to conflate my anti-capitalist message with anti-semitic rhetoric, as the UK politicians and their msm puppets have so adeptly accomplished, is very ill-intended and manipulative. Critics took liberty to pick and highlight my written words, which were based in actual fact, about how some of the older folk in the community who claimed to be Jewish came upon me while I was painting my mural and asked me who these characters were and when I replied they were aghast at how I could portray someone like Rothschild in such a wicked manner. They expressed to me all of the good deeds Rothschild had done for the Jewish community and the world at large. That\u2019s what they said! Also, for the record, I have never said anything about these characters representing anything more than greedy old European and American men in power. JP Morgan carried the look that interested me the most, that of a fat cat who perhaps had too much fine wine and rich food in his time. The cartoonish way these characters are depicted was inspiration I took directly from the monopoly game itself, knowing that I would only have but 3 days to gather supplies and complete my mural on a very limited personal budget before needing to continue on with my travels, which affected the degree to which I could execute these very complex men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was also their interpretation, and never mine, to point out \u201chook noses&amp;quot; &amp;quot;crooked noses\u201d and other vile Nazi, Third Reich anti-Semitic propaganda, even concocting cuckoo ideas like how the naked figures under the monopoly board depicted &amp;quot;starving holocaust victims\u201d when they actually represent the multi-races of humanity! As a thinking feeling human being to hear such stuff makes me sick to my stomach. It is because fundamentally I see humans as a species, is that so hard to accept? I believe that our religious choices do not define us. These religions are like clothing and it is the choice of the wearer to wear what he or she wants. That should not separate us as humans who breathe the same air and bleed red. It is the financial division that I take issue with and feel its unnatural effects on those who should be family due to species. This is one planet and we are one people, Earth People. The fact is that some are highly uncomfortable with others and would use divisive acts to keep us separated, arguing over nonsense as they continue to rob and pillage the earth. This is the world I painted, it is the world we live in now, and this conversation is most important if we as a species are to make it to the next level of our evolution. But this conversation was halted, my mural vandalized live on the BBC by a businessman in a suit who spray painted the word haganah (a now defunct Jewish paramilitary organization) over it, the mural was eventually buffed, and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really don\u2019t have too much opinion on the labor party. Their recent decision to dig up this 6 year old controversy and violently drag my name and art through the mud was theirs to make and only time will tell if karma is ever something they\u2019ll have to deal with. All politicians are scum for all I care. With that said, I also have the utmost respect for the working class. My family is working class and artists and I have become self-reliant because of it. Growing up on welfare with a single mom in the seedy backlots of Hollywood throughout the Reagan/Thatcher years, getting my education in economics 101 from the streets of LA to Tokyo as a graffiti writer throughout the 90s, vandalizing city walls to find my voice, I have chosen my own path of freedom. I am an anarchist and over the past couple of years I have worked ardently to free myself from these statist shackles, radically disassociating from ideas that no longer serve their purpose. Change is coming and as a self-defense mechanism I believe that the new Crypto reality and blockchain technologies may be providing some answers. How do we get out from under the tyrannical grip of the banking globalists and corporations ruling our world? I believe it exists in the decentralization of our monetary system, but could we apply a bit of that thinking to our state of humanity as well? Can we decentralize humanity? I think we can and it has already begun and the usage of my mural, which is mirroring reality, is a perfect example of how wacko the media, the politicians, and their financiers are becoming in their attempt to regain control over a society who is waking up.

For what it's worth, I am the son of a Hungarian Jew born in 1944. My grandfather was sent to Mauthausen shortly after my dad's birth. I enjoy Jewish art and culture. Basically, I'm not an antisemite (although I have been accused of it on reddit in recent days).\n\nFirstly, the mural. The artist himself admits that two of the bankers are Jewish. They are Rothschild and Warburg. The other four are other famous non-Jewish bankers, including JP Morgan (depicted with a big nose) and Rockefeller. So it's a group of white men who are united by wealth and power, not religion.\n\nThe symbolism in the mural is that of the illuminati and Freemasons. It isn't Jewish, although some wacky people have linked Freemasons to a Jewish conspiracy called the Elders of Zion in the past. This is very much a minority view in the small minority that believe in a global conspiracy of this kind.\n\nSo in a nutshell, we have a mural linking famous wealthy people - who happen to be Jews and non-Jews - to a global conspiracy. Somehow this has been construed as \"clearly antisemitic\" with people identifying most or all of the people at the table as Jews. I think this says more about the cognitive bias of the people viewing the mural. I didn't see what the fuss was all about until I read some comments about it.\n\nNow, we are supposed to believe that a message of support from Corbyn's facebook account to the artist 6 years ago somehow endorses blatant antisemitism, and that this is of great importance right now. It's conceivable that Corbyn didn't even see the picture, as most MPs' social media is run by advisers. As for the picture being blatantly antisemitic, I'd disagree. I didn't see it, and frankly, the mean banker goblin things in Harry Potter look far more stereotypical of antisemitic propaganda.\n\nThe story first surfaced 3 years ago, around the time Corbyn was getting elected leader for the first time. It then resurfaces when one of his own MPs - Luciana Berger - apparently sees it on Twitter and sends him a message. She then goes public with the story at 3pm having waited since \"this morning\". Why the urgency for a response about a six year old comment? Could it be timed to coincide with Owen Smith's sacking?\n\nLuciana Berger is a former director and current member of Labour Friends of Israel. LFI is an organisation whose purpose was to \" promote the interests of Israel\" until it was rebranded (but not fundamentally changed in 2003). It has close ties with the Israeli government. The majority of Labour MPs at the protest and in the media speaking about antisemitism are LFI members (Berger, Streeting, Umunna etc.). They are also opposed to the direction in which Corbyn is taking the party.\n\nThe two organisations (BoD and JLC) that sent the letter to Corbyn and called the protest also have close ties with Israel. JLC is a charity and as such does not have to reveal its donors. The leadership of both organisations are very sympathetic to the Israeli regime and the Conservative party.\n\nI could go on about media coverage for hours, but I won't. Needless to say, all the main media outlets have run with the narrative as framed by LFI, BoD and JLC. This is just a continuation of the reporting of antisemitism in Labour that mysteriously started the moment Corbyn became leader (despite many of the incidents, including this one, happening while Miliband was leader).\n\nThe most disturbing thing about this story is the repurposing of language and the chilling effect of antisemitism on debate. Any shorthand, such as saying \"Israel\" instead of \"the government of Israel\" when critical is now antisemitic. To question whether something is actually antisemitic is antisemitic, if someone else has deemed the thing antisemitic. Criticism/caricaturing of individuals who happen to be Jewish (e.g. Rothschild) is now antisemitic. It's bananas, and obviously plays to the interests of \"the government of Israel\".\n\nNow BoD and JLC are making demands about expulsions from the Labour party. Both organisations are part of the Israel lobby. Let that sink in. The government of another state indirectly demanding changes to the democratically elected opposition in this country.\n\nWould we stand for a Labour Friends of Russia? A Conservative Friends of Iran? A Lib Dem Friends of North Korea? OK, that last one's a bit extreme, but you get the idea. We are dealing with an apartheid state that is guilty of multiple human rights abuses, after all. Why the hell should any other state be allowed to lobby parliament? It's an affront to democracy.", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest episode in the Labour antisemitism saga has really wound me up. For what it&amp;#39;s worth, I am the son of a Hungarian Jew born in 1944. My grandfather was sent to Mauthausen shortly after my dad&amp;#39;s birth. I enjoy Jewish art and culture. Basically, I&amp;#39;m not an antisemite (although I have been accused of it on reddit in recent days).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the mural. The artist himself admits that two of the bankers are Jewish. They are Rothschild and Warburg. The other four are other famous non-Jewish bankers, including JP Morgan (depicted with a big nose) and Rockefeller. So it&amp;#39;s a group of white men who are united by wealth and power, not religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The symbolism in the mural is that of the illuminati and Freemasons. It isn&amp;#39;t Jewish, although some wacky people have linked Freemasons to a Jewish conspiracy called the Elders of Zion in the past. This is very much a minority view in the small minority that believe in a global conspiracy of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in a nutshell, we have a mural linking famous wealthy people - who happen to be Jews and non-Jews - to a global conspiracy. Somehow this has been construed as &amp;quot;clearly antisemitic&amp;quot; with people identifying most or all of the people at the table as Jews. I think this says more about the cognitive bias of the people viewing the mural. I didn&amp;#39;t see what the fuss was all about until I read some comments about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, we are supposed to believe that a message of support from Corbyn&amp;#39;s facebook account to the artist 6 years ago somehow endorses blatant antisemitism, and that this is of great importance right now. It&amp;#39;s conceivable that Corbyn didn&amp;#39;t even see the picture, as most MPs&amp;#39; social media is run by advisers. As for the picture being blatantly antisemitic, I&amp;#39;d disagree. I didn&amp;#39;t see it, and frankly, the mean banker goblin things in Harry Potter look far more stereotypical of antisemitic propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The story first surfaced 3 years ago, around the time Corbyn was getting elected leader for the first time. It then resurfaces when one of his own MPs - Luciana Berger - apparently sees it on Twitter and sends him a message. She then goes public with the story at 3pm having waited since &amp;quot;this morning&amp;quot;. Why the urgency for a response about a six year old comment? Could it be timed to coincide with Owen Smith&amp;#39;s sacking?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luciana Berger is a former director and current member of Labour Friends of Israel. LFI is an organisation whose purpose was to &amp;quot; promote the interests of Israel&amp;quot; until it was rebranded (but not fundamentally changed in 2003). It has close ties with the Israeli government. The majority of Labour MPs at the protest and in the media speaking about antisemitism are LFI members (Berger, Streeting, Umunna etc.). They are also opposed to the direction in which Corbyn is taking the party.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two organisations (BoD and JLC) that sent the letter to Corbyn and called the protest also have close ties with Israel. JLC is a charity and as such does not have to reveal its donors. The leadership of both organisations are very sympathetic to the Israeli regime and the Conservative party.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could go on about media coverage for hours, but I won&amp;#39;t. Needless to say, all the main media outlets have run with the narrative as framed by LFI, BoD and JLC. This is just a continuation of the reporting of antisemitism in Labour that mysteriously started the moment Corbyn became leader (despite many of the incidents, including this one, happening while Miliband was leader).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most disturbing thing about this story is the repurposing of language and the chilling effect of antisemitism on debate. Any shorthand, such as saying &amp;quot;Israel&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;the government of Israel&amp;quot; when critical is now antisemitic. To question whether something is actually antisemitic is antisemitic, if someone else has deemed the thing antisemitic. Criticism/caricaturing of individuals who happen to be Jewish (e.g. Rothschild) is now antisemitic. It&amp;#39;s bananas, and obviously plays to the interests of &amp;quot;the government of Israel&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now BoD and JLC are making demands about expulsions from the Labour party. Both organisations are part of the Israel lobby. Let that sink in. The government of another state indirectly demanding changes to the democratically elected opposition in this country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would we stand for a Labour Friends of Russia? A Conservative Friends of Iran? A Lib Dem Friends of North Korea? OK, that last one&amp;#39;s a bit extreme, but you get the idea. We are dealing with an apartheid state that is guilty of multiple human rights abuses, after all. Why the hell should any other state be allowed to lobby parliament?

I actually made a whole bunch of Hamentacsh cookies for my crew while underway during Purim, a celebratory Jewish holiday.\n\n2. Strictly speaking, no.  Heaven and Hell as the world knows it is actually a Christian invention, especially Hell, which has no actual mention whatsoever in any of the old texts. And Heaven is no crazy cloud palace of gold harps, angel wings, and (presumably) AI that doesn't cheat in Mario Kart. Jewish afterlife isn't even truly a place, really.  It's a simple, yet deeply complex state of being that is hard for others to grasp if you are not raised on it, and even then it is still hard to conceptualize.  To be in Heaven is to be \"close\" to God's light. A good person who dies living a good life will rest in warmth, nuzzled up with the souls of their family who passed before them, and connected with the souls of all other good people.  And that's all it is. A comfortable rest. Nothing more. Nothing less.  And those who do not live a good life? Well. They just... fade, really. It is not an eternal suffering of fire and brimstone, it is just a...coldness. Nothing more. Nothing less. And To live a good life doesn't mean you are a perfect person. On the contrary, one of the tenets of being Human is making mistakes. In fact, you're technically not allowed to start learning about the teachings of the Kabbalah until you are in your 40's, when you get most of your impulses and hot headedness out of your system.\n\n3. The orthodoxy and \"mainstream\" Judaism recognize each other as family, but other than that, we leave each other to our own devices unless we must convene for something.  Hasidim in particular is especially irreverent and it makes many other Jews uncomfortable, because we are not supposed to brag about being Jewish or \"Chosen People\".  But what can you do? We all still went through the motions of growing up Jewish, we all still know the traditions and philosophies. We are a people of an ancient bloodline that predates most everything, of ancient wisdom from an ancient time.  Our \"Jewish Identity\" as a culture is very unique in how closely and strongly we are bonded. It's what makes things like Israel and surviving shit like the Holocaust as a tight knit people possible.\n\nWhile there is a notable division of the house between the Orthodox and Modern sects, if you asked any of us what we were, we will all say \"Jew.\"  The sect is secondary.\n\n...we do make fun of how goofy they are though.

It is near impossible on a boat to do this.  My grandmother did though, as do a few other family members, and boy oh boy do I love Kosher foods and Jewish recipes.  I actually made a whole bunch of Hamentacsh cookies for my crew while underway during Purim, a celebratory Jewish holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, no.  Heaven and Hell as the world knows it is actually a Christian invention, especially Hell, which has no actual mention whatsoever in any of the old texts. And Heaven is no crazy cloud palace of gold harps, angel wings, and (presumably) AI that doesn&amp;#39;t cheat in Mario Kart. Jewish afterlife isn&amp;#39;t even truly a place, really.  It&amp;#39;s a simple, yet deeply complex state of being that is hard for others to grasp if you are not raised on it, and even then it is still hard to conceptualize.  To be in Heaven is to be &amp;quot;close&amp;quot; to God&amp;#39;s light. A good person who dies living a good life will rest in warmth, nuzzled up with the souls of their family who passed before them, and connected with the souls of all other good people.  And that&amp;#39;s all it is. A comfortable rest. Nothing more. Nothing less.  And those who do not live a good life? Well. They just... fade, really. It is not an eternal suffering of fire and brimstone, it is just a...coldness. Nothing more. Nothing less. And To live a good life doesn&amp;#39;t mean you are a perfect person. On the contrary, one of the tenets of being Human is making mistakes. In fact, you&amp;#39;re technically not allowed to start learning about the teachings of the Kabbalah until you are in your 40&amp;#39;s, when you get most of your impulses and hot headedness out of your system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The orthodoxy and &amp;quot;mainstream&amp;quot; Judaism recognize each other as family, but other than that, we leave each other to our own devices unless we must convene for something.  Hasidim in particular is especially irreverent and it makes many other Jews uncomfortable, because we are not supposed to brag about being Jewish or &amp;quot;Chosen People&amp;quot;.  But what can you do? We all still went through the motions of growing up Jewish, we all still know the traditions and philosophies. We are a people of an ancient bloodline that predates most everything, of ancient wisdom from an ancient time.  Our &amp;quot;Jewish Identity&amp;quot; as a culture is very unique in how closely and strongly we are bonded. It&amp;#39;s what makes things like Israel and surviving shit like the Holocaust as a tight knit people possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While there is a notable division of the house between the Orthodox and Modern sects, if you asked any of us what we were, we will all say &amp;quot;Jew.&amp;quot;  The sect is secondary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...we do make fun of how goofy they are though.

Salah was arrested by British police in 2011 when he was due to speak at an event in the House of Commons \u2013 alongside Corbyn. In 2012 Corbyn called Salah \u2018a very honoured citizen\u2019.\n\n2. Labour Students at Oxford University Labour Club mocked the Jewish victims of the Paris kosher supermarket attack, called Auschwitz a \u2018cash cow\u2019, and used the Neo-Nazi slur \u2018Zio\u2019, according to extensive testimony from Jewish students. After months of obfuscation, including an NEC decision to not publish a party report that concluded there had been \u2018some incidents\u2019 of anti-Semitic behaviour, Labour\u2019s NEC decided not to discipline the key perpetrators.\n\n3. A Jewish Labour MP, Ruth Smeeth, was sent a 1,000 word death threat from a Corbyn-supporter calling her a \u2018yid c\u2013t\u2019.

Jeremy Corbyn was an active member of an \u2018anti-Semitic\u2019 Facebook group, \u2018Palestine Live\u2019. The group included Holocaust denial, 9/11 conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic slurs. He said he did not see the offensive posts and left in 2015.\n\n6. A former Labour parliamentary candidate in Witham, John Clarke, shared a Neo-Nazi meme saying the Rothschild family has used money lending and Israel to \u2018take over the world\u2019. He said the meme \u2018contained a great deal of truth\u2019 and was later suspended.\n\n7. Jeremy Corbyn had a ten-year association with a group which denied the Holocaust.

Jackie Walker, formerly vice-chair of Momentum, said Jews were the \u2018chief financiers of the sugar and slave trade\u2019, criticised security for Jewish schools, and said Holocaust Memorial Day was not \u2018inclusive\u2019 enough. After the comments were made and widely condemned, Corbyn shared a platform and campaigned alongside Walker.\n\n9. Jeremy Corbyn hosted an Islamic cleric in Parliament in 2009, who in 2006 wrote that \u2018Europe has made political correctness, the cult of the Holocaust and Jew-worshipping its alternative religion\u2019.\n\n10.

Two Jewish Labour councillors in Haringey resigned, saying it is impossible to be a Jewish Labour councillor due to overwhelming anti-Semitic abuse. Joe Goldberg and Natan Doron reported that \u2018many members have repeated to me assertions about Jews having big noses, controlling the media and being wealthy\u2019, and that a fellow councillor accused Goldberg of \u2018bagel-barrel politics\u2019. On his resignation, a Haringey Momentum activist tweeted to Goldberg: \u2018At least [you] will have more time to count your money.\u2019 Mr Goldberg said complaints he made to party officials were dismissed.\n\n13. Andrew Slack, a councillor in Chesterfield, was suspended after sharing an anti-Semitic meme of a blood-smeared, hook-nosed Israeli soldier. The meme said \u2018Israel was created by the Rothschilds\u2019.\n\n14. Bethany Barker, a student activist who introduced Jeremy Corbyn at a 2017 local elections campaign event, described a Kippah as a \u2018Jew cap\u2019 and said Andres Breivik, the Norwegian far-right terrorist, should \u2018get forced to live in a synagogue\u2019.\n\n15.

Bromley is still a Labour councillor and no disciplinary action has been taken.\n\n16. Ken Livingstone reportedly said a Jewish journalist was \u2018just like a concentration camp guard\u2019, that Jews vote Tory because they are rich and that Hitler supported Zionism. Despite his attempt to draw a parallel between those who fought for Jewish freedom and those who perpetrated a Jewish genocide, Livingstone was only given a temporary suspension from a party disciplinary panel \u2013 a decision Corbyn supported, despite 100 Labour MPs calling for Livingstone\u2019s expulsion.\n\n17. Terence Flanagan, a member of Hampstead and Kilburn CLP, compared a Jewish councillor to Josef Goebbels and, when calling for his expulsion, referred to former Labour donor Michael Foster allegedly as \u2018the Jewish millionaire\u2019. Flanagan was suspended, but then readmitted to the party after formal written warning.\n\n18. Tim Lezard was offered a job to work at Labour\u2019s Southside HQ, despite tweeting \u2018I\u2019m thinking of setting up another new campaign group. Either Conservative Friends of Nazis, or Nazi Friends of Israel.\u2019 When his tweets were revealed the job offer was rescinded.\n\n19. Labour Party member and Momentum Teesside activist Bob Campbell has shared an image of a rat marked with a Star of David and claimed Israel controls ISIS. Campbell denied to the press that he had been suspended by the party.\n\n20. Mike Sivier, author of the far-left Vox Political blog, has claimed there is a \u2018conspiracy\u2019 between Jews and those who defend them in the UK, saying: \u2018We are being told that agents of a foreign country have infiltrated our institutions\u2019. He was due to stand as a Labour candidate in council elections in 2017 but was suspended before the ballot took place.\n\n21. Labour Councillor and former Labour Mayor of Blackburn, Salim Mulla, called Zionist Jews a \u2018disgrace to humanity\u2019, endorsed a video which blamed Israel for school shootings in the USA, and said \u2018Zionism\u2019 was orchestrating ISIS. After an initial suspension he was reinstated as a Labour member.\n\n22. In 2016, Aysegul Gurbuz, a Labour councillor in Luton, resigned after tweet surfaced where she said Hitler was \u2018the greatest man in history\u2019.\n\n23. The chair of Manchester Labour Students, Tayyib Nawaz, resigned after tweets surfaced where he claimed \u2018Hitler was Jewish\u2019 and Israel was comparable to ISIS.\n\n24. A Labour Council candidate in Great Yarmouth claimed \u2018it\u2019s the super rich families of the Zionist lobby that control the world. Our world leaders sell their souls for greed and do the bidding of Israel.\u2019 He was then dropped as a candidate.\n\n25. Far-left activist Gerry Downing, a Labour member who claimed the existence of a \u2018Jewish question\u2019, said \u2018elements of the Jewish-Zionist bourgeoisie\u2026 have played a vanguard role for the capitalist offensive against the workers\u2019, was expelled after then Prime Minister David Cameron brought his case up at PMQs.\n\n", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corbyn came to the defence of Sheikh Raed Salah, who revived the medieval anti-Semitic \u2018blood libel\u2019 slur that Jews cook with children\u2019s blood.

He said he did not see the offensive posts and left in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former Labour parliamentary candidate in Witham, John Clarke, shared a Neo-Nazi meme saying the Rothschild family has used money lending and Israel to \u2018take over the world\u2019. He said the meme \u2018contained a great deal of truth\u2019 and was later suspended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Corbyn had a ten-year association with a group which denied the Holocaust. Mr Corbyn was a \u2018stalwart\u2019 supporter of Deir Yassin Remembered, attending events in 2013, with the group\u2019s founder, Paul Eisen, a self-professed Holocaust denier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackie Walker, formerly vice-chair of Momentum, said Jews were the \u2018chief financiers of the sugar and slave trade\u2019, criticised security for Jewish schools, and said Holocaust Memorial Day was not \u2018inclusive\u2019 enough. After the comments were made and widely condemned, Corbyn shared a platform and campaigned alongside Walker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Corbyn hosted an Islamic cleric in Parliament in 2009, who in 2006 wrote that \u2018Europe has made political correctness, the cult of the Holocaust and Jew-worshipping its alternative religion\u2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasreen Khan, a Labour council candidate subsequently barred from standing, asked: \u2018What have the Jews done good in this world?\u2019. She said schools were \u2018brainwashing us and our children into thinking the bad guy was Hitler\u2019 and said \u2018Jews have reaped the rewards of playing victims\u2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Labour councillor in Birmingham, Zafar Iqbal, shared a David Duke video on Facebook entitled \u2018CNN Goldman Sachs and the Zio Matrix\u2019. The Labour party accepted Mr Iqbal\u2019s apology and claim that he had have no recollection of sharing this video\u2019 \u2013 no disciplinary proceedings were enacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two Jewish Labour councillors in Haringey resigned, saying it is impossible to be a Jewish Labour councillor due to overwhelming anti-Semitic abuse. Joe Goldberg and Natan Doron reported that \u2018many members have repeated to me assertions about Jews having big noses, controlling the media and being wealthy\u2019, and that a fellow councillor accused Goldberg of \u2018bagel-barrel politics\u2019. On his resignation, a Haringey Momentum activist tweeted to Goldberg: \u2018At least [you] will have more time to count your money.\u2019 Mr Goldberg said complaints he made to party officials were dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Slack, a councillor in Chesterfield, was suspended after sharing an anti-Semitic meme of a blood-smeared, hook-nosed Israeli soldier. The meme said \u2018Israel was created by the Rothschilds\u2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bethany Barker, a student activist who introduced Jeremy Corbyn at a 2017 local elections campaign event, described a Kippah as a \u2018Jew cap\u2019 and said Andres Breivik, the Norwegian far-right terrorist, should \u2018get forced to live in a synagogue\u2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pam Bromley, a Labour Councillor in Lancashire, posted links to an antisemitic article entitled \u2018World War 3: Trump Begins Paying His Homage to Rothschilds,\u2019 commenting \u2018we must remember that Rothschilds are a powerful financial family (like the Medicis) and represent capitalism and big business\u2019. Bromley is still a Labour councillor and no disciplinary action has been taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ken Livingstone reportedly said a Jewish journalist was \u2018just like a concentration camp guard\u2019, that Jews vote Tory because they are rich and that Hitler supported Zionism. Despite his attempt to draw a parallel between those who fought for Jewish freedom and those who perpetrated a Jewish genocide, Livingstone was only given a temporary suspension from a party disciplinary panel \u2013 a decision Corbyn supported, despite 100 Labour MPs calling for Livingstone\u2019s expulsion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terence Flanagan, a member of Hampstead and Kilburn CLP, compared a Jewish councillor to Josef Goebbels and, when calling for his expulsion, referred to former Labour donor Michael Foster allegedly as \u2018the Jewish millionaire\u2019. Flanagan was suspended, but then readmitted to the party after formal written warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Lezard was offered a job to work at Labour\u2019s Southside HQ, despite tweeting \u2018I\u2019m thinking of setting up another new campaign group. Either Conservative Friends of Nazis, or Nazi Friends of Israel.\u2019 When his tweets were revealed the job offer was rescinded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour Party member and Momentum Teesside activist Bob Campbell has shared an image of a rat marked with a Star of David and claimed Israel controls ISIS. Campbell denied to the press that he had been suspended by the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Sivier, author of the far-left Vox Political blog, has claimed there is a \u2018conspiracy\u2019 between Jews and those who defend them in the UK, saying: \u2018We are being told that agents of a foreign country have infiltrated our institutions\u2019. He was due to stand as a Labour candidate in council elections in 2017 but was suspended before the ballot took place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour Councillor and former Labour Mayor of Blackburn, Salim Mulla, called Zionist Jews a \u2018disgrace to humanity\u2019, endorsed a video which blamed Israel for school shootings in the USA, and said \u2018Zionism\u2019 was orchestrating ISIS. After an initial suspension he was reinstated as a Labour member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Aysegul Gurbuz, a Labour councillor in Luton, resigned after tweet surfaced where she said Hitler was \u2018the greatest man in history\u2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chair of Manchester Labour Students, Tayyib Nawaz, resigned after tweets surfaced where he claimed \u2018Hitler was Jewish\u2019 and Israel was comparable to ISIS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Labour Council candidate in Great Yarmouth claimed \u2018it\u2019s the super rich families of the Zionist lobby that control the world.

{"archived": false, "author": "rosickyboi", "body": "Let\u2019s start with the mural. I assume you\u2019ve all seen it by now. Not just because it has provoked the present, perhaps climactic row about anti-semitism in the Labour Party, but also because it\u2019s \u201cstreet art\u201d. It\u2019s by Mear One, a graffiti artist who defines himself as underground and anti-war. (His real name is Kalen Ockerman.) I probably didn\u2019t need to tell any reader with progressive politics these qualifiers \u2014 to paraphrase Jerry Maguire, I had you at street art. Clearly, this is a man fighting the good fight.\n\nAnd yet his mural is racist. Or, at least, Jews seem to think so. How can this be? To put it stupidly, how can someone so apparently left-wing be accused of something so apparently right-wing?\n\nLet\u2019s look at Mear One\u2019s own justifications. In 2015, after the Muslim mayor of Tower Hamlets, in east London, had the mural removed, Mear said that \u201csome of the older white Jewish folk in the local community had a problem with me portraying their beloved #Rothschild or #Warburg\u201d.\n\nIgnore the patronising, Goebbels-like, insinuating tone \u2014 one that would never be used by anyone with progressive politics towards any other ethnic minority that felt under attack. Instead, consider why Mear (I\u2019m going to call him that, as One sounds a bit odd) decided to add hashtags to those names. It was posted on his Facebook page and thus these names can be clicked on. This means Mear is not saying: \u201cI have painted Rothschild, the Jewish banking dynasty\u201d, but: \u201cI have painted Rothschild, the Jewish banking dynasty whose name you can now follow into the darkest corners of the internet, which will help you understand how this Jewish banking dynasty controls the world\u201d.\n\nI think more important, however, is Mear\u2019s deliberate use of the loaded word \u201cwhite\u201d. As we know, almost any attack on the status quo these days comes with the assumption that the enemy is white \u2014 and straight and a man, but white is the high point of the trilogy. I agree with that. I agree that being white does bring with it enormous privilege, a lot of which the white person isn\u2019t even aware of.\n\nBut Jews are not white. Or not quite. At least, they don\u2019t always feel it. I don\u2019t mean just that Jews are of Middle Eastern descent and their melanin can follow suit. (Although they are: one of my first jokes on starting stand-up was, \u201cI\u2019ve been beaten up twice in my life, once for being Jewish, once for being a Pakistani\u201d.)\n\nWhat I mean is that being white is not, at heart, about skin colour, but security. It means you are protected because you are a member of the majority culture. Protected, that is, from prejudice, discrimination, second-class citizenship, dispossession and genocide. Which Jews \u2014 as perhaps you\u2019ve guessed I was about to say \u2014 have not always been.\n\nSo what Mear was doing by ignoring that historical truth about Jews \u2014 by calling them \u201cwhite\u201d \u2014 is reinforcing his credentials as Fighter for the Oppressed. He\u2019s saying, \u201cYes, I\u2019m caricaturing Jews, but that\u2019s OK because they are privilege and power and control and all the other things contained in the word \u2018white\u2019. Jews are The Man, and my job as a street artist is Sticking It to The Man.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where Jeremy Corbyn comes in. Here\u2019s Jeremy, in 2012, with not even a sniff of his oncoming destiny yet, seeing the street artist\u2019s work being taken down. So Jeremy\u2019s rebel radar is up: he spots, of course, the old Marxist historical parallels with the names Lenin and Rockefeller and Diego Rivera, and he weighs in behind Mear on Facebook.\n\nWhat he doesn\u2019t spot is the anti- semitism. He doesn\u2019t even spot other historical parallels you might have thought he would: between the mural and the depictions of hook-nosed Jewish bankers holding the world to ransom that were published weekly in the Nazi newspaper Der St\u00fcrmer. He doesn\u2019t spot that the mural could be a cover of a reprint of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the anti-semitic text from 1903 that purports to show a Jewish plot for world domination.\n\nThat\u2019s not because Jeremy is an anti-semite. Jeremy, like Mear, is a rebel, a champion of the oppressed. Which is why there is a video of him speaking emotionally at a demonstration to remember the 1936 Battle of Cable Street, which saw Oswald Mosley\u2019s fascists driven back from their march in the East End. The Jews whose houses Mosley\u2019s Blackshirts painted \u201cyid\u201d on are clearly oppressed. Jeremy can speak passionately for them, his voice breaking. Ordinary middle- income Jews upset about the depiction of Jewish bankers on those same streets \u2014 not so much.\n\nI don\u2019t think, however, that Corbyn even knew the mural was meant to depict the Rothschild and Warburg dynasties. All he will have seen is a rebel gesture against power. But there is, on both left and right, an awfully long history of capitalist power being represented as Jewish power, something that developed out of an aesthetic far older than capitalism, in which Jews were routinely painted and sculpted as gargoyles and devils throughout western culture.\n\nThis is where the invisibility to people such as Corbyn of these anti-semitic tropes becomes complicated. Jeremy has many bedfellows for whom these remain the primary way to portray the scheming, evil, capitalist enemy. And if you just think, \u201cWell, that\u2019s how our enemy looks\u201d, you are accepting it. It\u2019s a default.\n\nThat history is getting even longer as the present becomes overtaken by conspiracy theory. Conspiracy theory, I have said before, is how idiots get to feel like intellectuals. One idiot idea advanced by conspiracy theory is that the world, rather than being a complex place where good and bad things happen multifariously, randomly and for many reasons, is actually controlled by a shadowy elite for its own benefit. (Twenty-eight per cent of Labour members who voted for Corbyn in his first election as leader believe this to be true.) And whether you\u2019re David Icke, Mear One or Piers Corbyn (Jeremy\u2019s brother), it is not even a small jump from this shadowy elite being \u201clizards\u201d and \u201cIlluminati\u201d to being Jews.\n\nAnti-semitism \u2014 what I prefer to call anti-Jewish racism \u2014 is the only racism that casts the object of its hate with a dual status, both low and high. Although they can be considered stinking, cheating vermin, and all the other unlovely epithets racists use to describe minorities, only Jews possess this extra, subtle spin of being secretly in control, pulling the strings and forever conspiring to promote their own global agenda. This makes them a perfect fit for those \u2014 and they are legion \u2014 whose ego and sense of identity are served by the idea that they have spotted some cracks in the \u201cmatrix\u201d that no one else has (except all their conspiracy-theory mates).\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s all about money. A few years ago, I made a short film, The Y-Word, trying to raise awareness about the word \u201cyid\u201d being chanted at football matches. One of its points was that the y-word might be considered as unacceptable as the n-word. A progressive friend of mine said: \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d I asked why. He said: \u201cBecause Jews are rich.\u201d\n\nIt was an amazing thing for a person who was avowedly anti-racist to say (not least because of its implicit assumption that black people can never be rich). Yet that\u2019s the basic issue here: because Jews are thought of as comfortable, privileged and moneyed, they don\u2019t need the protections of anti-racism \u2014 the ones most promoted by the left. This is wrong, even if you think \u2014 which you should not, because it\u2019s not true \u2014 that all Jews are rich. My grandparents were: they were industrialists in East Prussia. They owned a brick factory. They had servants. By the time they were fleeing to England with my mother as a baby in 1939, however, that had all been robbed from them. And by the end of the war, most of their family \u2014 and therefore a large section of mine \u2014 had been murdered. It doesn\u2019t matter how rich you are, because racists will smash in the door of your big house that they know you don\u2019t deserve anyway.\n\nThis is why Jews don\u2019t always feel \u201cwhite\u201d, if by white you mean, to put it bluntly, safe. I didn\u2019t feel white as a 12-year-old at a new school when one teacher was overheard to say of me, venomously, \u201cJew\u201d, and another replied: \u201cOf course.\u201d I didn\u2019t feel white when, loving TS Eliot as a teenager, I turned a page to discover that his poem Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar includes the lines: \u201cThe rats are underneath the piles. / The jew is underneath the lot.\u201d I didn\u2019t feel white when I was actually being beaten up in London in the 1970s, however much I might later convert it to comedy. I didn\u2019t feel white when \u2014 and this is what led to the Y-Word campaign \u2014 a man behind me at Stamford Bridge, the Chelsea stadium, started shouting repeatedly, \u201cF*** the f****** yids! F*** the f****** Jews\u201d, while stewards told to operate a zero-tolerance culture for racism ignored it. And I don\u2019t feel white now when a Corbynista \u2014 one of hundreds \u2014 tweets me to say that the Mear One mural isn\u2019t anti-semitic, it\u2019s justifiably showing up \u201cZionist greed\u201d.\n\nBut, unlike a person of colour might, nor do I feel at present as if the political party I might look to in order to feel safe \u2014 the party of the left and social justice \u2014 would defend me, either.\n", "score": 21, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "LabourUK", "date_year_month": "2018-04", "created_utc_converted": "2018-04-01 08:54:45", "score_overall": 18, "words": "jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy illuminati jewish conspiracy jew jew greed", "shared_words": "jewish conspiracy illuminati jew greed", "socre_distint": 5}
{"archived": false, "author": "kieslowskifan", "body": "Modified from an [earlier answer of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3g64o0/how_did_the_nazi_propaganda_machine_spin_germanys/?limit=500#ctvf772) \n\n&gt; Enjoy the war, for the peace is going to be terrible- popular German joke in the last year of the war\n\nAs the fortunes of war turned against Germany after the Battle of Stalingrad, German propaganda found an imperative need to readjust to this new reality. Prior to the military reversals of 1942, German propaganda had operated on the principle of presenting an \"ersatz reality,\" wherein the state-dominated media maximized Germany's victories and ignored the salient reality that Germany's war was not a short one and her enemies persisted in fighting Germany. The scale of defeats like Stalingrad, the growing Allied bombers, and the surrender of German forces in North Africa pricked this media bubble and German propaganda organs responded accordingly. \n\nThis retooling of the Third Reich's propaganda apparatus in light of defeat pursued several seemingly counter-intuitive strategies. For one thing, despite the fact that the Third Reich was a personalist dictatorship *par excellence*, the figure of Hitler disappeared from German propaganda. In contrast to propaganda from the earlier years of victory, post-Stalingrad news of German military operations seldom invoked Hitler's name or connected him too heavily to military operations. This was part of a deliberate strategy on Goebbels's part as he recognized connecting Hitler too intimately to Germany's military fortunes made him, and by extension, the legitimacy of the entire regime, culpable when these operations did not bear fruit. Rather than present images of the F\u00fchrer, Hitler was  invoked in late war propaganda as an abstract figure that stood for all Germans. This could just be from invoking his title, or oblique historical analogies such as films that made apparent the connection between Hitler and historical personages like Frederick the Great. Hitler, whose visage was omnipresent in state propaganda between 1933-1941, became an abstraction. By the same token, German propaganda also emphasized the severity and violence of German military setbacks, but with a unique spin. Allied bombing, the Soviet massacres of Polish officers at Katyn, and other actions of the Allies became staples of German propaganda after the tide had turned as it showed that Germany's enemies were merciless. This [poster](https://www.kunstkopie.de/kunst/unbekannter_kuenstler/massaker_von_katyn_ns_propagan.jpg) of the Katyn massacre does not shy away from either blood or the gruesome faces of the NKVD officers. The idea behind this emphasis upon the Allies' purported barbarity was to bind the Germans together through a policy of \"strength through terror.\" This dehumanization of the Allies' military underscored that no compromise was possible and this was a war in which there was to be no quarter given and none expected.  \n\nThese new strategies often dovetailed with established propaganda discourses that had been present within the Third Reich since 1933. The regime's castigation of the so-called \"November Criminals\" of 1918 also found new currency in this environment. Interrogations of German troops captured after 20 July 1944 often reported back that one key motivation for fighting on was to prevent a repeat of Germany's humiliating defeat at the end of the First World War.  One important component of the demonization of the Allied military was that German retribution was in the making. Since 1933, one of the central legitimizing planks of the NSDAP was that it had enabled German technology and genius. The vaunted V-weapons tapped into this established narrative that German technical expertise brooked no rivals. But beyond rockets and other *Wunderwaffen*, National Socialism had always stressed the ability of the will to transcend any material obstacles. This propaganda's emphasis upon collective action in the face of numerical superiority fed into this notion that the will is superior to rational logic. Similarly, the destruction of German landmarks and the seemingly indiscriminate nature of Allied bombing heightened the sense that this was a cultural war and that the Germanic culture constantly trumpeted by the Third Reich was in existential danger. \n\nOne sinister aspect of the late war propaganda was its turn to a heightened antisemitism. Goebbels used the solidarity of Allied coalition of both the imperial Britain, hypercapitalist United States, and the Bolshevik USSR as evidence of grand global Jewish conspiracy against Germany. This [infamous poster](https://www.ushmm.org/information/press/press-kits/traveling-exhibitions/state-of-deception/behind-the-enemy-powers-the-jew) was only one example of this propaganda line that a single Jewish force was holding together a coalition against Germany. Victor Klemperer in his diaries would note the increasingly shrill antisemitism in propaganda as Germany's fortunes waned. The widespread knowledge about the Holocaust amongst the German public imparted a weight to this propaganda that it might not have otherwise possessed. Although they might not have known the specifics of the Holocaust, most Germans were aware that something quite terrible had happened to the Jews in the East. Even though the antisemitism was troweled on so thick to strain credibility in this propaganda, it encouraged the expectation that the Allies would hold Germany collectively responsible  for the mass murder of the Jews. This does not mean that the German public accepted the NSDAP and Propaganda Ministry's antisemitism wholesale, but in some cases Germans interpreted antisemitism quite differently than the state. One popular rumor among German civilians in 1943/4 was that Hungary had not been the target of any Allied bombings was because the Hungarian government had spared its Jews. The SD recorded a number of complaints that because the Horthy government has ghettoized Jews in Budapest the Allies would not attack this human shield, and there was grumbling within the German populace that Hitler did not do the same for cities like Berlin or Hamburg. And some of this disgruntlement was not clandestine, but took the form of direct petitions to Goebbels. There were a string of letters to the Propaganda Ministry after the mass operations to clear Hungary's Jews in 1944 demanding that they be used as human hostages against Allied bombing.   But the general acceptance of some of the antisemitism produced by Goebbels's machine precluded thought of or even the possibility of a negotiated peace for much of the German public.   News of the Morgenthau Plan, which would have deindustrialized Germany, the expansion of Allied bombing, and the scale of German reverses fostered a general expectation of a Carthaginian peace.   \n\nThe effectiveness of this late-war propaganda is open to interpretation. While it could not rekindle hope in final victory, it did strengthen the resolve of some Germans to see the war to its bitter conclusion. Yet, even as propaganda turned to negative integration (uniting around a threat), it could not arrest the gradual estrangement of much of the German public to the National Socialist state. Goebbels himself appreciated this sentiment and his famous  February 1943 *Sportpalast* speech had veiled threats against the \"Golden Pheasants\" of the NSDAP who were thus far still enjoying a prewar lifestyle.  This late-war propaganda often worked in conjunction with greater arbitrary state violence directed against Germans, especially after the 20 July plot. The propaganda drive for mass action and a collective response to Allied aggression heightened the sense of social anomie and the breakdown of society that came as bombing and wartime pressures destroyed the German infrastructure and stretched the civilian domestic economy well past its breaking point. The final agonies of the last few months of the war, as well as the violence meted out to Germans that shirked in their duties, helped to cement the postwar myth that Germans were double victims of the war- who were both subject to extreme violence from their military enemies, but also brutalized by a hypocritical criminal regime.  \n\n*Sources*\n\nKershaw, Ian. *The 'Hitler Myth': Image and Reality in the Third Reich*.

{"archived": false, "author": "SlavGael", "body": "This thread will be a civil war...\n\n\nAnyway, when I was a christian I really liked reading the Bible, specifically examining historical context of the verses I read, and I never thought \"homosexuality is not okay\" or \"slavery is alright\", I read what was happening around time the Bible was written and checked why it was written. Here is example of what you can get if you don't look at Bible as a book in the void but a book which was written on earth. This text is not of my own authorship but I agree with it 100%:\n\n\nIdolatry, promiscuity and shrine prostitution are what Paul is addressing in Romans 1 \u2014 not same-sex relationships between faithful and committed partners.\n\n\nNeil Elliott has called attention to the striking similarities between Paul\u2019s language and the incredible greed, violence, and sexual excesses of Gaius Caligula, an emperor who reigned in a period not too long before Paul wrote Romans. First of all, Gaius is closely linked to the practice of idolatry. The Roman writer Suetonius reports how Gaius \u201cset up a special temple to his own godhead, with priests and with victims of the choicest kind.\u201d Another Roman writer, Dio Cassius, comments negatively on how Gaius was the only emperor to claim to be divine and to be the recipient of worship during his own lifetime. Gaius also tried at one point to erect a statue of himself in the Temple in Jerusalem; he was dissuaded only by a delegation from Herod Agrippa. Hence the link between Gaius and idolatry would have been well-known indeed, particularly in Jewish circles. But Gaius also serves as \u201cExhibit A\u201d for out-of-control lust. Suetonius reports how Gaius \u201clived in perpetual incest with all his sisters, and at a large banquet he placed each of them in turn below him, while his wife reclined above.\u201d He records gruesome examples of Gaius\u2019s arbitrary violence, vindictiveness, and cruelty. Later, Suetonius chronicles Gaius\u2019s sexual liaisons with the wives of dinner guests, raping them in an adjoining room and then returning to the banquet to comment on their performance. Various same-sex sexual encounters between Gaius and other men are similarly recounted. Finally, a military officer whom he had sexually humiliated joined a conspiracy to murder him, which they did less than four years into his reign. Suetonius records that Gaius was stabbed through the genitals when he was murdered. One wonders whether we can hear an echo of this gruesome story in Paul\u2019s comments in Romans 1: 27: \u201cMen committed shameless acts with men and received in their own person the due penalty for their error.\u201d Gaius Caligula graphically illustrates the reality of which Paul speaks in Romans 1: the movement from idolatry to insatiable lust to every form of depravity, and the violent murderous reprisal that such behavior engenders.\n\n\n\nThe problem is, people have horrifically misunderstood two simple words in this ancient letter that St. Paul wrote to an early Christian community in the trade city of Corinth.\n\nThe words are: malakoi and arsenkoitai.\n\nMatthew goes on to define malakoi as \u201ceffeminate.\u201d It\u2019s a Greek word that literally means \u201csoft\u201d and is used to describe fine clothing elsewhere in the New Testament. In a moral context, this word is actually more about \u201clack of self-control, weakness, laziness, or cowardice.\u201d \n\n\nThere were sexual connotations for \u201cmalakoi\u201d as well, but again, it always points backs to uncontrolled acts of lust or misused sexuality \u2014 no matter the gender or act. The word was not understood to reference same-sex behavior in the church until after the 20th century, when Bible translations adopted a new slant.\n\nArsenkoitai is more bizarre and hard to grasp. Many believe that St. Paul actually invented the word, as it is extremely rare in ancient Greek literature.\n\nThe word literally is a combination of two other words in Greek: arsen (male) and koites (bed). So, arsenkoitai could be translated literally as \u201cmale-bedders.\u201d And this word was understood by Bible translators before the 20th century to mean male-male sexual intercourse.\n\nBut when the word is used elsewhere in ancient Greek literature, it references the abuse of the poor (as in the Sibylline Oracles) or \u201ceconomic exploitation and power abuses (as in a 2nd century text called the Acts of John).\u201d The Acts of John lists arsenkoitai amongst a list of sins separate from a catalog of other sexual sins. Many believe (as Vines so cogently breaks down) that arsenkoitai is about economic abuses and exploitation.\n\nWhich is why the ancient act of \u201cpederasty\u201d is often brought up in relation to passages like this\u2014 the practice of Greek elite elder men who would adopt young men to use as sexual objects. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Christianity", "date_year_month": "2018-04", "created_utc_converted": "2018-04-03 02:26:19", "score_overall": 4, "words": "greed jewish conspiracy cowardice", "shared_words": "greed jewish conspiracy cowardice", "socre_distint": 4}

The reason the alt-right hates them is that their ability interact with actual ancaps depends on having a Jewish scapegoat.\n\nThe only reason the alt-right has been able to get any traction in ancap circles despite having clear authoritarian desires is that they have sculpted this mythology of \"high IQ, low time preference\" white people having a *natural, genetic tendency* toward liberty but toward which \"low IQ, high time preference\" people of other races simply cannot be bent.\n\n\"Thus,\" their argument goes, \"we are literally the path to anarcho-capitalist society you seek! We are, in fact, the true ancaps, unafraid to do what is necessary while soy boys jerk off to Ayn Rand! If blacks were capable of liberty, where are all the liberty based black countries? Look at the voting patterns for black people! They always vote for leftist policies! Checkmate!\"\n\nAnd to some extent that is probably true. At least in the US, racial minorities do tend to vote for expanded government. And the alt-right would like to leave the conversation at that. But the reality is that *no* countries have *ever* leveraged their democracy to elect any sort of lasting contraction of the state regardless of their racial makeup. Democracy simply cannot constrain the growth of the state. Demographics don't change this. As evidence, look at the most socially meddlesome countries in the west. Scandinavia is home to several of them. 95% white. Not a single racial minority in any position to electorally influence anything whatsoever. Still eagerly embracing central planning, social justice, egalitarianism, all the other stuff that sends American social conservatives into a panic. Look at the pants shitting that went down when Bernie Sanders suggested modeling our policies on theirs. He might as well have suggested scrapping the constitution and ratifying the communist manifesto.\n\nSo, how can this be? How can all these high IQ, low time preference descendants of Thor be falling into such Marxist cuckoldry that it deserves no distinction from literal Stalinism? Simple.\n\nJews. \n\nJews control the world. They control the global banking industry. They control all significant western institutions of higher learning. In essence, they are the shadow government that runs the loom from which is woven the fabric of a white society where men cower in a corner while drooling Africans impregnate their women. Destroy the Jew and the white man will finally have the blinders removed from his eyes and take his rightful place as the keepers of Asgard (an absolutely state-free Asgard, mind you wink wink).\n\nLose that conspiracy, lose any claim to libertarianism and confess you are simply in the business of building a vanguard party. And we all know what vanguard parties do.\n\nAt the end of the day, that's all the alt-right is. It is a vanguard party. They will tell whatever voting block they can get to listen to them whatever it is they think they want to hear. When they talk to you, they are all about economic freedom and the freedom of speech and the 2A. When they talk to your racist uncle, they reverse course and talk about state sponsored programs to pay blacks to move to Africa and to build a big wall between us and the Mexicans. When they talk to your uptight, Baptist neighbor, they talk about fighting degeneracy with mandatory minimums for prostitution and harsher drug penalties. When they are in the rust belt, suddenly maybe central planning isn't so bad and maybe we *need* a little more aggressive tariff policy.\n\nOnce they get power, who knows?

{"archived": false, "author": "Double-Down", "body": "&gt; Scandals provoked by accusations of anti-Semitism have become a recurrent feature of British politics. As the latest tumult subsides we have an opportunity to reflect on the issues that underlie these controversies.  \n&gt; \n&gt; One lesson of the last two weeks is that people who swear they are militant opponents of anti-Semitism \"in all its forms\" too often turn out to have friends \u2013 real friends, comrades, Facebook friends  \u2013 who are happy to spread anti-Jewish slurs or imagine the basic facts of the Holocaust are up for debate. \n&gt; \n&gt; For this reason when Labour Party leaders insist there will be no place for anti-Semites in the Party, their words don\u2019t measure up to the problem. Too many believe they face a handful of anti-Semites, a bunch of interlopers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Others acknowledge the problem is more widespread but then trot out evasive phrases about \"unconscious anti-Semitism,\" or vaguely suggest we educate people to recognise anti-Semitic tropes.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problems go deeper than Labour leaders have been willing to admit. Even though we conventionally associate anti-Semitism with the right and fascism especially, the political culture of the Left has long been a source of anti-Semitism.\n&gt; \n&gt; A more recent development is that some avowed anti-racists are seemingly unable to recognise anti-Semitism when it stares them in the face. They dismiss it instead as a smear perpetrated by \"Blairites\" and Zionists.\n&gt; \n&gt; While the disciplinary reforms recommended by Shami Chakrabarti may help overcome these problems, the Labour Party requires more than denunciations and expulsions. It also needs reflection, education and above all leadership.\n&gt; \n&gt; A helpful place to start is the important distinction between \"anti-Semites\" and \"anti-Semitism.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; We find it at the heart of George Orwell\u2019s writing on the subject. In October 1948 Orwell wrote to his publisher, \"I think [Jean-Paul] Sartre is a bag of wind and I\u2019m going to give him a big boot.\" It was Sartre\u2019s Portrait of the Anti-Semite (better known in English as Anti-Semite and Jew) which had provoked Orwell.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sartre\u2019s book was organised around the idea that the \"anti-Semite\" was an identifiable type: bourgeois, reactionary, uncomfortable in the modern world.  Orwell, by contrast, in his essay on \"Antisemitism in Britain\", published in April 1945, presents a very different view.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anti-Semitism (not the anti-Semite), he insists, is present across all classes and is pervasive in British literary culture from Chaucer to Shakespeare to T.S Eliot and Aldous Huxley. Anti-Semitism, Orwell proposed, is a shared problem, not a pathology confined to a particular type.\n&gt; \n&gt; He drew a striking conclusion from this insight: \"The starting point for any investigation of anti-Semitism should not be \u2018why does this obviously irrational belief appeal to other people?' But 'why does anti-Semitism appeal to me?'\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Labour politicians would do well to emulate Orwell\u2019s honest introspection and contemplate the movement to which they have given their lives. Doing so means coming to terms not only with Jews and anti-Semitism but also capitalism and race.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anti-Semitism has been recurrent feature of radical and socialist politics in Britain from the 19th century's William Cobbett to the present day. We find it in the Chartist movement in the 1840s and in the pages of Keir Hardie\u2019s Labour Leader, which in 1891 proclaimed that imperialist wars were being planned to suit the interests of \"hook-nosed Rothschilds.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Jews were good when outcast, a long way away and suffering from Tsarist oppression. But many of the same socialists and radicals who protested against pogroms were first in line to pronounce the Boer War an expression of Jewish conspiracy.\n&gt; \n&gt; In failing to acknowledge this inheritance, Labour leaders disavow a painful and dishonorable aspect of the movement\u2019s past. And as events in recent weeks have shown, these problems have not died away.\n&gt; \n&gt; Across the political spectrum protagonists continue to categorise Jews as \"good\" and \"bad\". The habit is clearly visible on the Left. Here, too often, Jews find that having the \"correct\" view on Israel/Palestine and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership is a precondition for getting a hearing on anti-Semitism.\n&gt; \n&gt; A key feature of modern anti-Semitism has been the racialized projection of \"the Jew\", an archetype which stands above and in conflict with the working class. Throughout the history of the left, certain anti-capitalist visions generated by socialists have overlapped and combined with this strain of anti-Semitism.\n&gt; \n&gt; What makes anti-Semitism particularly attractive and dangerous for the left is that it can appear oppositional. It provides an easy personification of oppression in the face of less tangible, global forms of domination.\n&gt; \n&gt; Which takes us to the mural in Tower Hamlets; the cause of so much controversy last month. Entitled Freedom For Humanity, the mural depicts six men, some with exaggerated \"Jewish\" features, at a table dictating the 'New World Order'. In 2012, when the local council ordered the mural\u2019s removal, Jeremy Corbyn signalled his opposition on Facebook.\n&gt; \n&gt; When asked to clarify his message, the artist Mear One claimed the mural depicted \"class and privilege,\" nothing more. In fact it offered a vision of class stained through with modern anti-Semitism: a critique of capitalism in which the forces of global power are rendered \"Jewish.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Everyone, including now Corbyn himself, recognises this. Yet for all the attention it received, one thing seems to have eluded almost all commentators: the mural not only depicts Jews and Jewishness, but places them in opposition to the pain and suffering of black and brown bodies.   \n&gt; \n&gt; The mural controversy illustrates the ambiguous position Jews occupy within contemporary anti-racist politics.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the left limits itself to a conception of racism which focuses solely on white privilege, it will continue to find it difficult to recognise Jews as its victims. Similarly, if European racism is understood only as a consequence of colonialism, we ignore the history of racialized exclusions within Europe itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; We need to place colonial racisms alongside anti-Semitism, and recognise how the two intersect and sometimes diverge.\n&gt; \n&gt; American scholar and Pan-Africanist W.E.B. Du Bois did just this when he came face-to-face with the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto shortly after the war. It was \u201cparticularly hard for me to learn\u201d, said Du Bois of the rubble in Warsaw, that this \"was not even solely a matter of color.\" These reflections by Du Bois remind us today that color-coded definitions of racism cannot account for the history of anti-Semitism.\n&gt; \n&gt; This difficulty is deepened by the success of Jewish integration in contemporary Britain. Overwhelmingly a middle-class community, disproportionately represented in 'top professions,' lauded by the political elite and with a growing tendency to vote Conservative, British Jews are poorly positioned to evoke sympathy from those anti-racists who imagine that poverty, exclusion and racism always line up neatly together.\n&gt; \n&gt; And then there is the question of Israel/Palestine, which has poisoned the Labour Party debate on anti-Semitism in recent years and continues to do so today. The great majority of British Jews feel an attachment to Israel, constituted as Jewish state. This, of course, creates a further problem for those parts of the Left invested in a distinction between Jewish identity and Zionism as a political ideology.\n&gt; \n&gt; Attempts to fold Zionism into the history of European imperialism and settler-colonialism bring into sharp view the ongoing racism and injustice endured by Palestinians. At the same time, however, they obscure the fact that Zionism was in part a response to murderous racism experienced by Jews inside Europe.\n&gt; \n&gt; This tragic dynamic was captured powerfully by Hannah Arendt: \"The solution to the Jewish question merely produced a new category of refugees, the Arabs, thereby increasing the number of stateless and rightless by another 700,000 to 800,000 people.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Israel today is a complex entity: while some focus solely on its democratic credentials, others point to its history of dispossession and occupation. It advertises its promotion of LGBTQI rights but remains a bastion of state-sponsored ethnic and religious privilege.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jewish statehood has generated a complicated history that sometimes makes it difficult for the left to even recognise anti-Semitism in Britain, let alone combat it.\n&gt; \n&gt; conspiratorial power or holding diaspora Jews directly responsible for the actions of the Israeli state.\n&gt; \n&gt; The challenge for the Labour Party\u2019s leadership is to oppose racism unconditionally and without exception, including when its targets are Jews, most of whom do not support the party and who do identify with the State of Israel.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is also a challenge for the Jewish community, especially its leaders. Their alertness to anti-Semitism in Britain should lead them to support anti-racist campaigns more generally. It might also allow them, even as they identify with Israel, to recognize and censure the racialized inequalities within and beyond its recognised boundaries.\n&gt; \n&gt; In their different spheres, both the Labour Party and the leaders of the Jewish community should understand that anti-racism is not divisible.", "score": 5, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "LabourUK", "date_year_month": "2018-04", "created_utc_converted": "2018-04-10 12:38:38", "score_overall": 15, "words": "jewish holocaust jew jewish conspiracy jew jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish", "shared_words": "jewish holocaust jew conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

They network in order to achieve that end. They value each other for the utility of achieving similar goals.\n\nThese beings abuse knowledge of self and otherwise to control others. Knowing thyself allows them to perceive more of what is going on and affect it while remaining concealed from corrective intentioned beings. ETs who choose to be parasites can easily offer this service, as their relative age and understanding allows them to do it with relative ease. \n\nThe suspicion of the Jewish people is very old and happens in so many places. It was thick leading up to and during World War 2. Even Henry Ford of the Ford motor company wrote articles about them. They are seen as self-superior and self-serving as they insidiously infiltrate and corrupt institutions in order to serve their own at the perceived expense of others. \n\nAfter the Holocaust, which traumatized the entire world, we began to look like\ndemons if we criticise Jewish people or even Israel for that matter. The fear of being seen as racist, even worse, antisemitic, is not just socially intense, it ends careers. So, we shut up to avoid getting into trouble. This allows their operations to go on in the semi-open without accurate descriptions of it affecting opinions.\n\nThe beings didn't just choose the Jews, who in this case are mostly being used as disposable tools, but many other secretive organizations of humans to infiltrate, corrupt and utilize for their self-serving goals. (repeating pattern of evil, hacking life and consciousness)\n\nThe Jews just offer a platform of useful tools/fools who can be persuaded to betray their own race. They achieve this by playing on their very real relative intelligence advantage over their fellow human beings. They are told they are inherently better, more deserving, special. They are one entity of many that are used this way. It's a trap for intelligent beings, to think they are better than those around them. They even do it to themselves.\n\nThe Jews apparently are victims of an external force of spiritual parasites and some of it rubs off on them. They can individually rejoin humanity simply by considering themselves equal to the goyim or gentiles. Then their empathy will reactivate and thus they will care about the suffering and injustice they cause and choose to stop doing it.\n\nThis external force wants us to emulate them. They are self-serving machines that know self-serving machines as they do, as ancient adepts at being self-serving machines. They apply this knowledge of self to control others who are foolish enough to choose this way of life. The key feature they ignore is that they effectively open themselves up to moral, logical and spiritual condemnation from other beings. \n\nTheir own enslavement and exploitation are justified by their choice to be self-serving even at the expense of others. They are to be enslaved as they enslave. If they fail, they take the fall on world as their counterparts do why they will do when they no longer can coerce or deceive to maintain imbalanced value exchange relationships, evade corrective forces, flee, betraying their own co-conspirators with ease. \n\nHaving loyalty to this type of being is like feeling comfortable going to the home of an unrepentant serial killer. They are fools, relatively intelligent compared to us, but fools nonetheless. Only a tiny few of these Jewish people even know what is going here. Hating the Jewish is not going to fix them, but reenforce the mind jobs being done on them by external forces. They will feel more separation from us and connection with these beings and their domination and control ways. \n\nWe need to have compassion for these people. See the mind job, through their eyes.

From that perspective it makes sense to question clothes and makeup, and that naturally falls on women since men don't dress in a sexual way in general. Now is this the proper solution? I don't think so, but I think there is a bit more to it than childish victim blaming.\n\nIf I think there's a Jewish conspiracy, then a holocaust seems a lot more reasonable. If I think God is real, then praying probably seems a lot more effective than doctors. I don't care that he's analyzing from a anti-sexuality perspective, I think the anti-sexuality perspective itself is stupid, and inherently leads one to a childish victim-blaming stance.\n\nAgain, you just seem to be bending into knots trying to mitigate this one guy's beliefs. You would never do this for anyone else. You would never say \"ah yes, but from the terrorist's perspective, he was sending them to heaven.\" You would say: \"wow, isn't it idiotic that he believed that killing all those people would send them to heaven?\"\n\n&gt; No one said we can't or shouldn't do this. The interesting question is if it's a long term solution to the issue.\n\nIs what? Reducing sexuality in apparel? Of course it's not a long term solution; it's not even a moral one. That's not an interesting question. Why should we limit people's ability to *look nicer* (I've given you a lot of slack so far with the \"reducing sexuality\" bit; in reality makeup his hardly \"sexual\" at this point, any more than wearing clothing that fits well), when we could just teach people how to handle attraction to your peers? The former seems ridiculous, especially when you seem to focus on the issue *exclusively on the women's side*.\n\nThe great thing is: sex-positive feminism already solves all of these problems, and would work in the long term. Peterson just doesn't want to engage with actual, reasonable social science. He just wants to peddle his nonsense and label the rest as his Neo-Marxist strawman.\n\n&gt; Again you have to differ between thinking aloud and actually suggesting solutions.\n\nBut if I thought aloud \"women who wear makeup are kinda hypocrites,\" which, if I was a learned professor who pretended to know modern social sciences, I wouldn't, but if I did, I would probably qualify that by saying \"well, no, makeup isn't really *that* sexual, and it's probably better to attack this from the side of the abuser.\" \n\nLook, we live in a world where most of the racism isn't white-hood lynch-mobbing anymore, it's more subtle. It's important that we engage with \"just suggestions\" because they are indications of what this person actually believes. Would Peterson demand these policies in today's climate? Of course not, they'd never work, and no one sane would want them. Would he suggest them in a more favorable political climate or if he was in power? Quite possibly.\n\nAgain, if I thought aloud \"well, what if the Jews really did control everything, and what if their globalist imperative is hypocritical given the isolationist agenda of Israel?\" you would still call me out. I haven't suggested policy, but I clearly have some dumb ideas churning in my head.\n\n&gt; Uniforms are a pretty widespread normalizer.\n\nBusinesses already have them! Why would he think that makeup is the last straw?\n\n&gt; And one interesting part - men are in general already in uniform (the suit).\n\nYeah, a suit, an item of clothing that emphasizes a man's broad shoulders and long chest. Should we ban them because they're to sexually arousing?\n\n&gt; Again, this is a way to reduce sexuality in the workplace, but we don't know if that's the proper solution for anything beyond unwanted flirting.\n\nWe do know: it wouldn't be.\n\n&gt; I do not blame women for abuse by men, and I'm pretty sure Peterson don't either. I interpret it as a way to avoid unwanted flirting, not abuse. I can of course imagine interpreting it as you do, especially how often the argument is used by actual misogynists.\n\nWait, what? If you know that this argument is used by *actual misogynists*, then why do you give Peterson a pass?\n\nAlso, again, I don't care that the intent is to reduce unwanted flirting or abuse; he wants to do it exclusively by limiting women's autonomy and ignoring the underlying issues. This is what makes it misogynist.\n\n&gt; I see what you are saying but I'm not sure what this big picture is. Is mentioning makeup in that context and saying a few facts about the wage gap enough to call someone misogynist? Maybe if that was the only thing he talked about all the time but it's a very small part of his views.\n\nBut are his other views overtly feminist? I'm sure he has reasonable views on personal hygiene and possibly psychology (I don't know what kind of professor he is), but you can hold both those and misogynist views simultaneously.\n\nAnd no, I say misogynist based on this comment, the wage gap stuff, his views on *Frozen*, the views much of his fanbase holds, and his biotruth rhetoric. Is that not enough? Why do you set the burden of proof against Peterson so high?\n\n&gt; It's mostly based on pretty solid science though, and if its not it has solid evolutionary backing. This differs from JF.\n\nAnyone who says that the current paygap is acceptable because of biology and evolution is either misinterpreting data, ignoring data, lying, or has terrible moral positions. This is much like JF.\n\n&gt; Have we really? I don't think this true even a bit.\n\nYou're talking to me from a computer, probably hundreds or thousands of miles away about some dude who said some dumb shit on a video platform wearing a suit\u2014a very specific kind of clothing which he bought with money, a thing with imaginary value\u2014to people who sit around getting fat on mass-manufactured food to then play videogames for apparent reason.\n\nWhat in our genes inherently codes for this shit? Where's the videogame gene? Spoilers, there isn't one. Our genes code for many things, but this ultimately results in a society which forms cultural values and informs behaviors far removed from biology.\n\n&gt; When we get too far from what we are built for, we pay for it dearly, often in the form of crippling depression and nihilism.\n\nWhat are we built for then? I'm probably supposed to be a hunter-gatherer, but no, I'm a college student studying computer science as it pertains to art, but I'm doing fine. There is no God, and life is meaningless, but that's cool. I'll make it up as I go along.\n\nThis is why I hate Peterson's rhetoric: it's lies for the weak. \"Don't know what you're doing? Ah, well let *me* tell you what you your biology tells you!\" You don't need his snake oil; you can find meaning far removed from the hunter-gatherer your genes tell you to be.\n\n&gt; It's not good thing to work 80 hours a week, why would we want to force women to take part of this as well?\n\nWho's forcing anyone? See, these are the effects of shitty Peterson rhetoric. I'm not talking about shoveling women into harder jobs they don't want; I'm talking about altering the media, teaching, and job landscape to be less hostile to women, so that when they ultimately do make a choice of where to work, it's not colred by diminutive imagery in media, negligence in teaching, or fears of being harassed.\n\nAlso, maybe these CEO jobs *shouldn't* be higher-paying jobs. Maybe teachers should get more. \n\n&gt; If anything we should focus on the other side and get men to prioritize life more reasonably.\n\nWhat does this even mean? How would this help women?\n\n&gt; Your whole \"unfairly indoctrinate\" assumes the situation has no roots in innate prioritization and that it's objectively bad to focus on other things than economy in life.\n\nI don't even know what you're talking about. You must be in full Peterson regurgitation mode. Maybe women want to just focus on other things. I'm not going to stop them. I just don't want girls to only have access to \"stay-at-home barbie\" toys and \"girls suck at math\" classes and \"you might get abused\" jobs which influence their decisions.\n\n&gt; It's not propaganda because there is a strong woman, it would be propaganda because of their motivations behind the plot and characters. Regardless, I don't want to go into details of not I'm not very familiar with.\n\n*But what are those motivations?* To present a strong female? Oh, god, the horror! It's a terrible hot take founded in misogyny and a fundamental misunderstanding of art.\n\n&gt; He claims high heels tilts the pelvis to enhance some womanly features and makeup such as rouge mimics the blush of sexual attraction. I have no idea of this is an accurate view of its history/purpose though. I 100% agree people wear these things without specific purpose or thought today though, which is why I disagree that it's hipocritical to wear makeup in any way.\n\nThis is my point though: provocative implies that there's intent to provoke. Women wear this stuff naturally, so implying that there *is* intent behind it is attributing malice where there is none. It implies that he thinks women are \"out to get\" men with the stuff that they wear.\n\n&gt; Is it though?

{"archived": false, "author": "FreeThinkingMan", "body": "Many are right wing because they deal with  the government trying to kill their kids and appeal to people's distrust in the government. These are the same sentiments put forward through mainstream right wing information sources so when many right wingers hear these crazy right wing conspiracy theories it isn't as ridiculous as it would appear to people who did not consume that type of information. If you listen to conservative talk radio the motives they project onto the government makes no logical sense. \n\nMost conspiracy theories rely on something that is unknown, unknowable, unfalsifiable, or something very complex so some alternate theory can just be made up and low information people will eat it up. Many things the government is involved in fits into all those categories secret and complex so it makes it easy to bullshit about. Federal reserve conspiracies fit this.\n\nAlso the right's religious views make them more prone to believing these conspiracy theories especially since many of them involve some threat to Christianity like Satan worshippers or Jews promoting satanic values through Hollywood. The mainstream right already attacks mainstream media and Hollywood, saying they are satanic and part of the illuminati isn't too much of a stretch from there.\n\nNeo Nazis and white supremacists are right wing and many conspiracy theories involve some grand Jewish plot. \n\nThe deep state conspiracy theory is also right along the lines of the conspiracy theory of shadow governments, that there are actual people behind the scenes pulling strings. What the Fbi, NSA, CIA, and the security industry do is almost entirely classified and secret so this has always made them susceptible for making anything up about. Past presidents have always respected these institutions and the importance in people's faith in them so they never actively took part in propaganda campaigns attacking them till Trump. \n\nPeople on the right don't know what credible sources of information are or have a significantly lower standard so they are more susceptible to believing some dude's blog promoting conspiracy theories.\n\nPopular left wing conspiracy theories usually involve the private sector and greed. The most widely believed one among the left I find troubling is the military industrial complex conspiracy theory. That militaries' and governments' decisions and interactions are based on profits off of weapons sales and not geopolitical resources, influence over major determinants of the economy, and long term physical and economic security. Many people don't understand the complexity of international relations and much of it is kept classified so it leaves room for people to make up and believe bullshit.\n\nAnother popular conspiracy theory among the left that is in a similar vein as the last one is Bush Jr invaded Iraq for oil profits and not for the above four reasons I detailed. Not understanding regional control and control over natural resources is incredibly more important than people give it credit for.  Especially oil, oil makes the world the go round when it comes to so many aspects of our domestic and global economy.\n\nAmong many on the left, usually those who oppose interventionalism(which isn't really an option), they aren't aware of all the external variables that impact the domestic economy. The left views America's military spending as a part of the military industrial complex and they refuse to take the time to understand its significance which is often complex and classified. \n\nThe left also believes in conspiracy theories related to campaign donations, they assume that every politician is bought and that is why we don't exist in some utopia where everything is free and minimum wage is $30. This conspiracy theory exists because economics is complex and what constrains what policy can be made realistically takes effort and intellectual honesty to be aware of. Prime examples of this are Obama's compromise on health care(which is made up of a sixth of our economy, you can't just radically rearrange it overnight), Obama's TARP bail outs(bail out of banks, which if they didn't happen it would cause a global economic collapse and devastate the entire American economy), and why the left or Obama didn't break up too big to fail banks(similar reason as the last one). On the latter one the left believes Obama was bought for by banks when the reality was that people don't know how finance and the economy work so any story about things that involve those can just be fabricated.\n\nI guess the left's conspiracy theories are more realistic in that the motives are not those of cartoon supervillians,  it is simply greed, but the left has its fair share of conspiracy theories. \n\nAnother conspiracy theory the left has that is in a similar vein as the kookier right wing ones is that big pharma has the cure for many illnesses it sells drugs for but doesn't release them because of profits. \n\nNone of these conspiracy theories are really funny when you look at their consequences, as they all lead people to believing, feeling, and acting in crazy ways all because they they think they are doing something righteous and ethical.**Nothing is more vile then misinformation and lies as it causes good men to be bad.** The guy in this video actually believes he is doing something righteous and good.\n\nIn most cases. I don't think bad people exist, more often then not it is just misinformed people doing what they think is good. It personally took me some time to view Bush Jr in this light and I am fairly confident by understanding of him is objective and correct. With that being said Trump is a bad one knowing he is doing bad, he is not misinformed trying to do good, I don't think anything in the future will be able to convince me otherwise but I will keep an open mind to facts and logical arguments.\n\nAnother reason why these aren't funny, is because the cynical and helpless thought processes these conspiracy theories breed, they prevent people from looking at the real problems we face and how to fix them. The helplessness often causes people to think they can't change anything or the system when the reality is that one person can change a lot if they apply themselves.", "score": 10, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "PublicFreakout", "date_year_month": "2018-04", "created_utc_converted": "2018-04-15 02:32:27", "score_overall": 21, "words": "conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy illuminati conspiracy jewish conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy greed conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy greed conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy", "shared_words": "conspiracy illuminati jewish greed", "socre_distint": 4}

Bull says he has never denied the Holocaust and re-posted the article in question to find out what his friends thought of it.\n\nLol I remember hearing about this one, it's a bit stupid tbh, not a good move for someone in politics, BUT, as he says he only shared it, does not mean he agrees with it.\n\n&gt;5. Jeremy Corbyn was an active member of an \u2018anti-Semitic\u2019 Facebook group, \u2018Palestine Live\u2019. The group included Holocaust denial, 9/11 conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic slurs. He said he did not see the offensive posts and left in 2015.\n\nAnd this is proof of him being anti-semitic how? Are you fucking serious? How is this proof? He is not in control of what gets posted, and, in your own description it points out he fucking left the group probably because the anti-antisemitism was pointed out to him.\n\n&gt;6. A former Labour parliamentary candidate in Witham, John Clarke, shared a Neo-Nazi meme saying the Rothschild family has used money lending and Israel to \u2018take over the world\u2019. He said the meme \u2018contained a great deal of truth\u2019 and was later suspended.\n\nYou realise that neo-nazis are far right, right? Again, silly move by someone in politics, but, from your description the meme doesn't actually sound very antisemitic, only the source of the meme, which may not have been that obvious? \nRothschilds do own a fucking shit load of banks in the world, yes there are conspiracies surrounding them so it doesn't sound like such a horrible action tbh.", "score": 5, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "date_year_month": "2018-04", "created_utc_converted": "2018-04-15 11:28:31", "score_overall": 10, "words": "libel jewish kosher jewish jewish holocaust jewish holocaust holocaust conspiracy", "shared_words": "libel jewish kosher holocaust conspiracy", "socre_distint": 5}
{"archived": false, "author": "CertifiedRabbi", "body": "You're trying to make it seem as if the Alt-Right revolves around holocaust denial. And you're trying to conflate our opposition to Jews controlling our news media, our entertainment industry, our financial system, our political system, et cetera, with the types of crazy conspiracy theories that you find on YouTube or on random blogs. If you want a better idea of what the Alt-Right really thinks about Jews, then you should check out [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAltRight/comments/6fvo25/please_explain_to_indians_east_asians_as_to_why/diliq55/) comment that I wrote about 10 months ago.\n\nAnd if debunking our views on Jews was as easy as you claimed, then feel free to debunk Kevin MacDonald's work [[1]](https://youtu.be/V6bmYOlV-K8)[[2]](https://youtu.be/g93OfL1Fybc)[[3]](http://www.angelfire.com/rebellion2/goyim/je1.pdf), because it's his work which serves as the basis for the Alt-Right's suspicion and hostility towards Jewish influence on the world. An Alt-Right Jew named Nathan Cofnas recently tried to debunk MacDonald's work (with the aid of Steven Pinker), but he failed miserably. I'm sure that you can succeed where Cofnas and Pinker failed, though... \n\nIt's also pretty hypocritical for Jews and gentile shitlibs to denounce anti-Jewish conspiracies when they regularly engage in very similar anti-White conspiracy theories. Just listen to [this](https://youtu.be/IdrrqS6IBnA) debate between Alt-Right leader Jared Taylor and \"anti-racism activist\" Tariq Nasheed. The anti-White conspiracy theories that Tariq Nasheed was spouting are little different than the most extreme anti-Jewish conspiracy theories that are out there. And yet Tariq and his anti-White ideas still enjoy widespread acceptance. \n\nJews and gentile shitlibs view racism and bigotry as the worst sins imaginable. And they have absolutely no problem with accusing all White people of being inherently and incurably racist and bigoted. And they're brainwashing the masses through the education system, mandatory corporate diversity seminars, and the media with this subversive, anti-White ideology. How do you think that's going to turn out for us Whites? Do you think that it could possibly lead to White people willfully committing racial suicide because they've been brainwashed since infancy to view the White race as incurably evil? Or is that just yet another thoroughly debunked conspiracy theory?\n\nJews and gentile shitlibs also routinely decry \"White privilege\" and bitterly complain about how Whites are overrepresented in various institutions, and yet these same Jews and gentile shitlibs completely lose their shit when the Alt-Right points out Jewish privilege and Jewish overrepresentation in various institutions. So, Jews want the ability to constantly subject the White race to radical forms of critique to the point that most people now view Whites as evil and privileged oppressors, but any attempt by the Alt-Right to critique Jewish power and influence is completely outrageous, crazy, and evil. What a convenient arrangement for Jews... \n\nBut as to why so many people associate the Alt-Right with holocaust denial and neo-Nazism now; Andrew Anglin is largely responsible for making neo-Nazism and holocaust denial synonymous with the Alt-Right. He originally rejected the Alt-Right as being too soft. But after seeing the tremendous growth of the Alt-Right, he then tried to strong-arm the movement by declaring on his blog that you aren't really Alt-Right if you believe in the holocaust. And because the Alt-Right prides itself on being politically incorrect, we don't purge people for being neo-Nazis and holocaust deniers, especially since some of our leaders are basically Nazi-lite. \n\nThe goal of our leadership was to red-pill as many people as possible and grow our ranks at any cost. And since advocating for White ethnocentrism is considered to be extremely politically incorrect, we naturally relate to other politically incorrect ideas. That's why we don't care if you're a misogynist, an MRA, a homophobe, an Islamophobe, a fascist, a monarchist, a neoreactionary, a neo-Nazi, a Klansmen, a neo-Confederate, a race realist, a White Nationalist, whatever. As long as you're willing to critique modern Western civilization from a right-wing, identitarian perspective, then you're cool with us. We don't really try to purge people from our movement unless they're really autistic and threaten to kill people or whatever. As long as it isn't illegal, then we let you fly your freak flag. \n\nI personally think that that's a bad idea because it chases more people away than it attracts, but I don't control the movement. I only support the Alt-Right because I'll support any movement that wants to combat the left's war on the White race. \n\nDesperate times call for desperate measures. If you shitlibs and Jews didn't support open borders and mass immigration and weren't trying to eradicate Whiteness, then the Alt-Right wouldn't exist. We're a defensive response to the left's ant-White agenda - which Jews played a central role in creating and fostering.  If you're going to play identity politics, then so are we, because otherwise we're vulnerable, atomized individuals going up against a massive coalition of highly collectivist identity groups (with Jews often at the reins) who are militantly opposed to our interests.

{"archived": false, "author": "commiespaceinvader", "body": "**Part 1/2**\n\nHistorians have indeed studied this phenomenon in the Baltic states and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, especially since fields such as memory and commemoration studies have emerged and established themselves as fields of interest among historians.\n\nThis however must be prefaced with a couple of general remarks: Memory and commemoration studies is \u2013 obviously \u2013 interested in how certain societies commemorate, memorialize, and remember their own past, that is what kind of narratives are prevalent in political and social discourse about one self and the past. The use of the term \"narrative\" is very intentional here since how societies tend to talk about the past is always a narrative, meaning a cohesive story with a distinct beginning, middle, and end that is far from comprehensive in that it does not encapsulate all of history but highlights certain aspects of it in relation to the current present. A classical example is f.ex. the history of the US a progress of originally defined principles of freedom and equality, which tends to leave out factors such the messy history of slavery etc.\n\nThis is important to grasp because when historians of that particular field write about the prevailing narratives of German and Soviet occupation, it is not their goal to answer the question, which one was worse. That is not a question historiography is really equipped to answer because of the multi-perspective nature of historical experience. What they write about is how these past are perceived the way they are today, why they are perceived that way, and how that relates to political and social discourse and formation. And in this sense, various prevailing perceptions of Soviet and German occupation of the Baltic countries in the current Baltic discourse have been viewed critically for their implications on current social and political culture.\n\nOne example that has been dealt with especially critical is the \"double genocide\" thesis as it is popular in Lithuania. Positing that there were two genocides in Lithuania, one committed by the Soviets, one committed by the Germans, has received criticism by historians and others as a political effort that tires to affirm a national narrative of victimhood, which in turn is used to advance a nationalist, often prejudiced and anti-semitic agenda. It has also been criticized as being used as a means to avoid discussion and/or research on the totality of the impact of Nazi and Soviet occupation on various Eastern European societies, in that collaboration with the Nazis (and even with the Soviets) is regularly ignored in favor of concentrating on victimhood alone. This \"model\" is not so much a serious academic effort to explain history but a politically (often imposed from above) narrative in order to legitimize certain political agendas, which can f.ex. be gleaned from [this article on Lithuania's genocide musem](http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/259677/lithuanias-museum-of-holocaust-denial?utm_source=fb&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=Apr2018).\n\nI want to emphasize again, that a criticism of the \"double genocide model\" as it pertains to Eastern European countries and specifically Lithuania as the most prominent example, is not an attempt to realitivize or downplay Soviet war crimes and oppression in Eastern Europe. Rather, it is a critique of a political agenda and its underlying ideology that seeks to use the victims of Soviet oppression and crimes as a soapbox. Rather than being interested in exploration of the suffering of the victims of Soviet oppression and the phenomenon at large, purveyors of the \"double genocide model\" are only interested in these things as far as they are useful for their agenda. This is neither proper historical engagement of a theme nor proper memorialization of these victims who deserve to be remembered outside of a political argument seeking to legitimize heavily nationalist narratives and suppress discussion of the social impact of occupation by Soviets and Nazis, especially the issue of collaboration.\n\nDovil\u00e9 Budryt\u00e9, professor of political science at Georgia Gwinnett College, has written extensively about the the \"double genocide model\" both in her article \"We call it genocide\": Soviet Deportations and Repression in the Memory of Lithuanians and in her 2017 book Taming Nationalism? Political Community Building in the Post-Soviet Baltic States. She describes the model as follows:\n\n&gt; According to this popular belief [...] there were two genocides in Lithuania in 1940-1953. The first one, 1940-1941 and 1944-1953, was committed by the Soviets. It included mass deportations and repressions. The second genocide was committed during World War II by the Nazis. Those who embraced this perspective [she cites e.g. Jonas Mikelinskas, a popular author or the state-sponsored Research Center of Genocide and Resistance] argued that Lithuanian Jews had actively participated in the deportations of Lithuanians and that Lithuanians had collaborated with the Nazis and participated in the Holocaust as an act of revenge.\n\nProfessional historians refute this theory and have actively tried to show it for the nonsense that it is, not just from the West but also e.g. Vytautas Berenis in Lithuania but the theory remained popular because it was and still is indeed state-sponsored through institutions such as the above mentioned center.\n\nBudryt\u00e9, Berenis and many others point out the flaws of these ideas: First of all, to portray Lithuanian collaboration as revenge for Jewish participation in the deportations is nonsense. The deportations were very much initiated from the central Soviet authorities and carried out by the apparatus that the Soviets brought to Lithuania, not by locals. Also, the deportations affected the Jewish community in Lithuania. So much so, in fact that [as Atina Grossmann points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5zetxi/how_did_holocaust_survivors_survive/) 80% of those Eastern Europe Jews who did survive the Holocaust did so because they were involuntarily or voluntarily deported/resettled by the Stalinist Soviet Union.\n\nSecondly, the idea of Jews as the \"allies\" of the Soviet Bolsheviks was (and still is) an anti-Semitic conspiracy trope, which became popular after the revolution in 1917 and was an essential feature of the Nazis' and other fascists' world view throughout the inter-war period and throughout WWII that has no basis in reality. In modern terms, it very much does the same as it did basically then: Denationalizing the Jews who were killed by the Nazis because it is always easier to regard the Lithuanians of Jewish faith as Jews rather Lithuanians, especially when you want to avoid a real discussion about collaborations. Lithuanians assisting the Nazis in killing Lithuanians sounds less fitting to a narrative of national victimhood than Lithuanians killing Jews \"as revenge\".\n\nThirdly, usually the numbers given for the deportations are a bit muddled. It is generally accepted that 136.000 Lithuanians were deported in the period from 1940-1953. This number alone, when viewed in the context of Lithuania having about 2.5 million inhabitants at the time is staggering but at the same needs to be treated with caution. Because it includes a.) the Jews deported by the Nazis, b.) the German Lithuanians fleeing Soviet occupation by signing up as Volksdeutsche and c.) the Lithuanians who again fled Soviet troops in 1944. If we look at the Soviet deportations itself, the following picture emerges:\n\nThe most extensive deportations by the Soviets occurred right after the first occupation of Lithuania in 1940. Within an incredible small amount of time, Soviet authorities deported 20.000 Lithuanians to Siberia and Tajikistan. The targets of thee actions were the military and political elite and their families, who were comprised of ethnic Lithuanians, ethnic Germans, ethnic Russians, ethnic Poles and sometimes also Jews. This, among other factors, resulted in the so-called June uprising against the Soviets and the Soviets using further deportations as a counter-insurgency tactic. This process (and the uprising) repeated itself after the war in the period of 1944-1953 albeit not at the same scale and again, primarily targeted against those who had collaborated with the Germans and those who still fought against the Soviets (which in many cases were the same people).\n\nTo be not afforded due process, to be persecuted and oppressed for one's political views and to institute a policy of uprooting thousands of people from their homes and deport them constitutes grave crimes on parts of the Soviet authorities. But they do not constitute genocide, especially not on the same levels of Nazism. The genocide of the Jewish community in Lithuania was one of the most total in all of Europe, resulting in Lithuania being declared the first \"jew free territory\" in Europe with a staggering 200.000 victims by mid 1942. Historians of the era generally hold that to execute such a massive amount of people in such a short amount of time was only possible because of the local collaboration, which was very active in terms of aiding the Nazis in their program. Case and point is a pogrom carried out by right-wing Lithuanian collaborators in Kaunas as early as June 28, 1941. So, in essence, scale, structure, and the amount of local participation can not be compared when it comes to Soviet deportations and the Holocaust, with the former also not constituting a genocide in the accepted sense both academically as well as legally.\n", "score": 11, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "date_year_month": "2018-04", "created_utc_converted": "2018-04-16 10:11:07", "score_overall": 11, "words": "jewish holocaust holocaust jewish jewish holocaust conspiracy jewish jewish jew holocaust", "shared_words": "jewish holocaust conspiracy jew", "socre_distint": 4}

{"archived": false, "author": "Koenvil", "body": "The article is interesting but I don't think his cases work well, or even come across well to be honest. The jist, the we are all human and the there is needless demonization of the other side is true. Certainly when we feel ourselves under attack it's make the other side evil and that's something we see in society. It's always easier to have honest discussion with people on the other side when you know them which I know. \n\nI have friends who have views totally opposite of mine, and it's always a pleasure to have a conversation with them about what we agree/don't agree with because we have an underlying respect for each other. This is lost online and out political discourse has become the worse for it. We should always remember that the other side is human too, and think's they're doing what's right. No one is the villain in their own story. \n\nThis article's examples however don't really come across well. We have Stone: A man who loves people like Milo and Gavin McInnes. Who says he hate's the \"globalist elites\" (dog whistle?) and goes on to say \"majority of the wealthy people in the world are white. In fact, they\u2019re Jews\". He says \"Jones also complains that he went from being asked to accept same-sex marriage to being asked to acknowledge trans youth in quick succession.\" and disagrees wholly with gender. Of course he says, \"\u201cYou\u2019re a classical liberal like me,\u201d he says. \u201cYou believe in free speech, individual rights.\u201d\". Yes he is be a good person, but a good person can still have terrible (or even evil) ideas. He treats his friends and family with love and care, but his actions would directly affect people I know in negative ways. What does one do when a person doesn't recognize the reality of their transgender friends, or demonizes their Jewish ones?\n\nOr Burns: The full on conspiracy theorist and holocaust denier. The one who \"writes about \u201cpoor migrants\u201d raping my daughter\". The less said about him, the better.\n\nIf these are the examples of modern conservatism, then they're in trouble. But I know it's not, I have plenty of friends who identify as conservatives and I disagree with them plenty. But they don't identify with white nationalists, or complain about the Jews. We can talk about the limitations of laws, of economics and of social issues. I know we're both working towards what's better for society. All I see from these people is just how effective red pilling is, and how terribly convincing insular communities with many angry memes can be. \n\nWe all have lines that we draw and certainly we are all human and try to treat each other as we do ourselves. But there is no endless grace from people to accept each other. Sometimes, it's just better to not waste time, and I guess for me that's with the people who he talked about. Not what I would consider the regular people of conservatism, but literal holocaust denying, \"globalist\" complaining, conspiracy theorists. I explore outside my bubble,  it's how I got to where I am today, and how I'll change for tomorrow.

{"archived": false, "author": "goldiespapa", "body": "BERLIN \u2014 In Germany\u2019s hugely popular hip-hop music scene, one of the biggest albums of the past year was from two trash-talking rappers who rhymed about their prowess in bed and in the weight room and about violently dominating their opponents.\n\nThe album has racked up sales, but has also attracted a different sort of attention. In one song, the pair boast about how their bodies are \u201cmore defined than Auschwitz prisoners.\u201d In another, they vow to \u201cmake another Holocaust, show up with a Molotov.\u201d\n\nWidespread condemnation turned into an uproar in the last week since the rappers, Farid Bang and Kollegah, won the Echo award for best hip-hop album at Germany\u2019s equivalent of the Grammys on April 12.\n\nThe lead singer of the country\u2019s pre-eminent punk rock band objected to the award from the same stage that night. \u201cIn principle I consider provocation is a good thing,\u201d Campino, the lead singer of Die Toten Hosen, said. \u201cBut we need to differentiate between art as a stylistic device, or a form of provocation that only serves to destroy and ostracize others.\u201d Other winners have said they are returning their prizes.\n\nPosting on Twitter in German, the foreign minister, Heiko Maas, wrote: \u201cAnti-Semitic provocations do not deserve awards, they are simply disgusting.\u201d\n\nHe also noted the unfortunate timing of the ceremony. April 12 is a day of worldwide solemnity. \u201cThat such a prize was handed out on Holocaust Remembrance Day is shameful,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe country\u2019s recording industry association had criticized the lyrics but defended its choice in the name of artistic freedom. Nominations are based on popularity and rankings on music charts, not artistic quality \u2014 a process the association has pledged to re-examine after the outcry.\n\nBut beyond the resentment over the award, the episode has also provoked soul-searching about incitement in art, and the extent of anti-Jewish sentiment in German hip-hop in particular.\n\nAnd most troubling, many believe, is what it says about the rise in anti-Semitism among young people, and the millions of impressionable rap fans who are generations removed from the horrors of Nazi rule.\n\nGermany\u2019s attempts to atone for the evils of its past, while confronting the troubles of its present, is its never-ending preoccupation. On Wednesday, in response to a video showing a man in Berlin wearing a Jewish skullcap being attacked by a group of young men speaking Arabic, Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to commit her government to fighting anti-Semitism \u201crelentlessly and with resolve.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis fight against such anti-Semitic excesses must be won,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. (The victim in the video turned out not to be Jewish \u2014 he was an Arab Israeli who said he was trying to prove to a friend that he could wear a skullcap in Germany without being hassled.)\n\nThe objectionable lyrics in the winning album, titled \u201cYoung, Brutal, Good Looking 3,\u201d do not explicitly deny the mass slaughter of some six million Jews by the Nazis, nor do they specifically incite hatred of Jews, both of which would have made them illegal under Germany\u2019s strict laws banning Holocaust denial.\n\nKollegah and Farid Bang did not respond to requests for comment. On the night of the ceremony, Kollegah replied to criticism by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make a political debate out of this,\u201d and invited anyone who wanted to discuss it to approach him at the after-party.\n\nIn the past, they have defended their lyrics as art and exaggeration. On Facebook last month, Farid Bang apologized to Esther Bejarano, a 93-year-old singer and Auschwitz survivor who had spoken out about the lyrics. Both men have offered to let Jews come to their concerts for free forever as proof, they said, that they bore no hatred.\n\nBut Jakob Baier, a researcher at the Hans B\u00f6ckler Foundation focusing on anti-Semitism in German rap music, called the lyrics \u201cdespicable\u201d and said they scorned the victims of Auschwitz. He noted that some of Kollegah\u2019s other songs and music videos promoted conspiracy theories and the message that \u201cthe world is in control of evil, and the evil is marked as Jewish.\u201d\n\nThe singer Campino criticized that award to Kollegah and Farid Bang, saying, \u201cEvery one of us has to draw the line where we feel the limits of tolerance have been reached.\u201d Credit Andreas Rentz/Getty Images\nIn the music video for his track \u201cApocalypse,\u201d a banker in a London office tower is shown controlling the evil forces in the world, and wearing a Star of David ring. After a final showdown between good and evil, Kollegah \u2014 a 33-year-old convert to Islam whose real name is Felix Blume \u2014 raps, \u201cMuslims, Christians and Buddhists lived together in peace,\u201d pointedly not mentioning Jews.\n\nAllegations of anti-Semitism have dogged German hip-hop for years and were even the subject of a recent documentary, \u201cThe Dark Side of German Rap.\u201d One song by the rapper Haftbefehl mentions a conspiracy theory about the Rothschilds, a Jewish banking family, and the video for another features images of Orthodox Jews carrying suitcases of money and diamonds over the lyrics \u201cmoney, money rich.\u201d\n\nMany lyrics are also homophobic and degrading to women \u2014 issues in rap music that transcend Germany\u2019s borders. In one song, the rapper Shindy says that his openness to having sex \u2014 described in an obscene way \u2014 with Jewish women is proof he is not an anti-Semite.\n\nThe scene\u2019s politics lean heavily anti-Israel. Bushido, another best-selling German rapper, once used a map of the Middle East, without Israel, as his Facebook profile picture. In an interview on Wednesday, he said that he had done it in solidarity with Palestinians because of his own Arabic roots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about Israel, it\u2019s about injustice everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no one listens when you\u2019re calm and polite, and so you have to use more drastic means.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, he faulted Kollegah\u2019s and Farid Bang\u2019s lyrics. Words that conjure images like \u201cconcentration camps, Auschwitz, Jews, people who were gassed \u2014 those shouldn\u2019t be used,\u201d Bushido said.\n\nWith surveys increasingly showing that the Holocaust is receding from memory, many are concerned that downplaying the gravity of what happened under the Nazis can open the door for a return of discrimination against Jews. This comes amid a rise of far-right populism across Europe, and the arrival of some 1.4 million migrants and refugees in Germany, many from Middle Eastern countries where hatred for Israel is taught in schools. Some popular hip-hop artists hail from Germany\u2019s inner cities and are of Turkish or Arabic descent. (Farid Bang, whose real name is Farid El Abdellaoui, has North African roots.)\n\nMs. Merkel\u2019s government has for the first time appointed a commissioner to combat anti-Semitism in response to reports that incidents are increasing, especially among the young.\n\nAccording to the Research and Information Center in Berlin, which records incidents of anti-Semitism in the German capital, 947 occurred last year, a 60 percent increase from 2016.\n\nChildren in German schoolyards casually toss about \u201cYou Jew,\u201d as an insult, and reinforce stereotypes about Jews, such as saying \u201cDon\u2019t be such a Jew\u201d when trying to convince someone to lend some change.\n\n\u201cAt a time when hate against Jews is increasing around the world and a flood of anti-Jewish sentiment can be seen online, especially among young people,\u201d said Monika Schwarz-Friesel, a professor of linguistics at Berlin\u2019s Technical University, \u201cto declare anti-Semitic and fantastical, conspiratorial song texts as \u2018artistic freedom,\u2019 and award them prizes is viewed by researchers of anti-Semitism as particularly irresponsible.\u201d\n\nAnti-Semitic themes have plagued other German music genres \u2014 in particular, punk and metal music popular among the country\u2019s neo-Nazis. But those groups have remained largely underground, often forced to perform outside Germany because of its Holocaust-denial laws.\n\nPopular German rappers, on the other hand, have a huge fan base; Kollegah has 1.4 million followers on Instagram. And the fans skew young. The music appeals to children and teens who share and debate the latest songs on social media and in schoolyards. \u201cYoung, Brutal, Good-Looking 3\u201d topped the charts in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and was streamed 23 million times on Spotify in the first week of its release on the service.\n\nSome rap fans have said that the lyrics were being unfairly scrutinized by people who did not understand the genre, in which rappers constantly try to outdo and outshock their rivals.\n\n\u201cOf course I think this line is tasteless,\u201d Michael Fritzsche, 26, of Leipzig, said, referring to the offending lyrics. \u201cBut let\u2019s be honest, a discussion about the political correctness in music lyrics should not be limited to rap.\u201d\n\nBut for all of the uproar over the words, Viola Funk, a journalist in Berlin who covers hip-hop, said she believed a larger point was being missed.\n\n\u201cGerman rap is a scapegoat, because youth culture is always a scapegoat,\u201d Ms. Funk, who directed \u201cThe Dark Side of German Rap,\u201d said. \u201cAs if it didn\u2019t have anything to do with society at large.\u201d", "score": 13, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Judaism", "date_year_month": "2018-04", "created_utc_converted": "2018-04-19 13:55:07", "score_overall": 18, "words": "holocaust holocaust jewish jewish jewish holocaust conspiracy jewish conspiracy jewish jewish holocaust jew jew jewish holocaust scapegoat scapegoat", "shared_words": "holocaust jewish conspiracy jew scapegoat", "socre_distint": 5}

He charged that they were blind to the growing antisemitism around them and cited the numerous antisemitic publications that abounded in Germany including the notorious \u201cProtocols of the Elders of Zion\u201d. The Russian secret police in the pre-World War I era had fabricated this account of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. Alfred Rosenberg, a refugee from the Baltic part of the Russian Empire who became a Nazi leader, brought it to Germany.

A large sign hangs from her neck: \u201cI am a German girl and allowed myself to be defiled by a Jew.\u201d She is surrounded by Nazi storm troopers.\n\nD.C. Council member Trayon White Sr. (D-Ward 8) studied the image. \u201cAre they protecting her?\u201d\n\nLynn Williams, an expert on educational programs at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and White\u2019s tour guide for the day, stared at the photo.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re marching her through.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarching through is protecting,\u201d White said.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re humiliating her,\u201d Williams replied.\n\nWhite, who drew widespread criticism last month when he asserted that wealthy Jews control the weather, on Wednesday made a visit to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. With him was Rabbi Batya Glazer of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington, a group that has been heavily involved in the first-term Democratic lawmaker\u2019s public rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more powerful than visiting the Holocaust museum for understanding the culture of the Jewish community, and our concerns about anti-Semitism,\u201d Glazer told an uninvited reporter who shadowed the tour.\n\nThose concerns surged after The Washington Post reported on White\u2019s outlandish comments on his public Facebook page espousing a conspiracy theory linking the Rothschild family \u2014 a Jewish banking dynasty and frequent target of anti-Semitic propaganda \u2014 with a murky plot of climate ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adtion.\n\nWhite later apologized and said he did not realize Jews might consider his comments offensive. He attended a Passover Seder and a bagels-and-lox breakfast with local Jewish leaders at city hall. He did not publicize his visit to the museum off the Mall in Southwest Washington.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like this is what you do when you\u2019ve been bad,\u201d Glazer said. \u201cThis is a place where one\u2019s world view is completely altered.\u201d\n\nAlso with White was his staff, which had closed up the office early to join the council member\u2019s guided tour. The overwhelmingingly African-American neighborhoods their office represents in Ward 8 are among the city\u2019s poorest and most isolated.\n\nThe museum allows photos for personal use, and the council member and his aides took many. As Williams explained the workings of the Nazis\u2019 pseudo-scientific race propaganda, White held up his cell phone before a poster with images of black, Native American and Australian men, titled \u201cRassen der Erde\u201d \u2014 \u201cRaces of the Earth.\u201d An aide took a shot of a pile of Torahs desecrated on Kristallnacht.\n\nThe group paused before grainy photos of German troops executing Catholic clergy in Poland by firing squad. \u201cWere they actually manufacturing these weapons?\u201d White asked.\n\nMoments later, White was nowhere to be seen.\n\nGlazer, the rabbi, texted him to ask his whereabouts. He wrote back that he hoped to see her outside the museum but he had to leave soon for an event in Ward 8.\n\nThe tour, scheduled to last 90 minutes, was halfway done. Seven of White\u2019s staff members stayed with the guide, who soon was showing them an exhibit on the Warsaw Ghetto. As she explained the walling in of Polish Jews, one aide asked whether it was similar to \u201ca gated community.\u201d\n\nGlazer spoke up.\n\n\u201cYeah, I wouldn\u2019t call it a gated community,\u201d she said. \u201cMore like a prison.\u201d\n\nThe group continued, without White, past a scale model of a gas chamber and photos of the residents of an eradicated shtetl. They stopped at the famous exhibit of shoes confiscated from concentration-camp prisoners.\n\nThe tour over, the rabbi praised White for being \u201cvery sincere in wanting to come here.\u201d But she was perplexed by his abrupt exit.\n\n\u201cI do not know what happened, and I find it confusing,\u201d she said.\n\nWhite, it turned out, was standing alone on the sidewalk outside the museum.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be coming back to see more of the museum. I didn\u2019t get a chance to see the whole thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a lot of education here, a lot of synergy here between what happened to the Jewish community and the African community.\u201d\n\nAsked why he left the tour halfway and where he went, he said nothing and held his cell phone to his ear.\n\nAsked whether he had reassessed his comments about the Rothschilds in light of what he had just seen, White walked east on Independence Avenue.\n\n\u201cThis opportunity has given me the chance to meet a lot of great Jews, a lot of people. A lot of good Jews that I\u2019ve never had the chance to meet before,\u201d he said after a long silence. \u201cIt\u2019s an awesome experience.\u201d", "score": 4, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "washingtondc", "date_year_month": "2018-04", "created_utc_converted": "2018-04-19 22:40:27", "score_overall": 10, "words": "jew holocaust holocaust jewish holocaust jewish conspiracy jewish jewish jewish", "shared_words": "jew holocaust jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

Furthermore why is there no evidence of what you call \"sexual debauchery\"? What specific things are you talking about?\n\n&gt;Did you know that Jews declared war on Germany before Nazis ever thought of a war?\n\nI didn't, mostly because they didn't. \"Jews\" cannot declare war, because they are not a nation. If you mean that some sort of jewish organisation formed that wanted to destroy Germany, what's your evidence?\n\n&gt;Did you know that Hitler sued for peace literally dozens of times, but churchill, under the control of zionists, said, quote \"Hitler will have this war whether he wants it or not\".\n\nNo, because Hitler never sued for peace at any point. In fact for a lot of the war he was at an advantage, and had no need to do such a thing. Of course since he committed suicide he never got around to peace talks.\n\n&gt;Did you know that by removing the money changers (Jews) and their evil usurious banking systems, they were able to go from the poorest Euro nation to the richest in under 5 years?\n\nNo, their economy was sparked by new industry (as it tends to be), specifically the war machine. Of course some of Hitler's other policies, particularly social ones, aided in improving the standard of living in Germany and stimulated the job creation market.\n\n&gt;Did you know that the last 5 countries we have destabilized and overthrown have had one thing in common: They tried to remove fiat currency, trade in gold-backed currency; and did not have a Rothschild central bank.\n\nWhich countries would those be?\n\n&gt;There are only 3 relevant countries in the world that are still attempting to remove themselves from the Jewish banking cabal, issue money based in reality, and eliminate fractional reserve banking. Guesses? North Korea, Syria, Iran.\n\nNorth Korea and Iran don't use a gold-standard, their currencies are backed by the dictatorship and the dollar respectively.\n\n&gt;Straight up, the good guys lost WWII\n\nIn what way were Germany the good guys? They invaded their peaceful neighbours and attempted to conquer them...\n\n-----\n\nYou then list a dozen or so images, all containing so-called \"jewish lies\". Since I can't validate these images they're of no practical use, and I'd rather not try and find their original sources.\n\n&gt;For any parrots or useful idiots who choose to regurgitate arguments which they have been told to respond to \"holohoaxers\" with\n\nNext you give another image, listing off \"false claims\" about holocaust deniers. According to this image you accept:\n\n* Persecution of the jews\n* Unethical treatment of the jews\n* The existence of concentration camps\n* Forced labour\n* The deaths of the jews in said camps\n* The deaths of other minority groups in the same manner\n* That all this was bad\n\nYou then go on to list what you claim you \"actually\" deny. Let's take a look:\n\n1) \"They deny there was a plan to murder all Jews\". There are so many sources that demonstrate this plan, official ones by the Nazi regime (and not mere propaganda by the allies). Why would they pretend that this was their plan if it wasn't? The allies didn't even believe what was going on until after the war! So why would they make up a plan they had no intention to carry out, especially one that would make them look so bad? And furthermore, why did they kill so many jews? Why did they act as though they were trying to commit genocide, when you say that wasn't the plan?\n\n2) \"They deny that jews were murdered systematically\". But we know that this was the case. Putting aside the previously mentioned documents in which the regime claims to do this, what explanation do you have for the use of gas cham-\n\n3) \"They deny the existence of gas chambers for mass murder\". So are you saying the chambers were built after the war? Or that people being gassed to death in large numbers isn't mass murder? Because we have bodies, we have gas chambers, and we have documents saying that they used the gas chambers to kill... it seems like a pretty safe position.\n\n4) \"They deny that 6 million jews died in the holocaust\". Well the nazis kept records of their prisoners... we know how many they killed because they told us. All tolled there were ~11 million people killed in concentration camps, of which ~6 million were targeted as jews. Are you claiming that these records are fake? What about the decline in the jewish population of Europe during that time period? It corresponds strongly to the deaths of 6 million jews, along with many others fleeing the continent.\n\n-----\n\n&gt;There is an organized and malevolent force at work in the world today called Sabbatean/Frankist Messianic Judaism\n\nSabbatean judaism was a 17th century religious movement where a guy claimed to be the jewish messiah. Frankism is the same thing, a guy claiming to be the messiah, but from the 18th century... What does this have to do with today?\n\n&gt;These fake Jews\n\nThey're real jews... well, they're all dead at this point (since it was 200 years ago), but they *were* real jews.\n\n&gt;[they] have a book called the Talmud\n\nAll jews have the Talmud, it's their religious text along with the Torah.\n\n&gt;which says, among other gems, that Goyim (any non-Jew) are cattle to be used as such\n\nCitation needed, but so what? Religious texts are not renowned for their treatment of non-believers.\n\n&gt; it is not murder to take a ladder from a goy in a hole even if it leads to his/her death\n\nCitation needed, but again so what?\n\n&gt;The Nazis had higher opinions of their animals than most Jews have of you or I.\n\nThe nazi regime literally attempted genocide, which is something I haven't seen the jews do. And you don't seem to be claiming they have, either...\n\n&gt;Don't believe me? Read the Talmud\n\nIf you just present the line reference where it says these things. You'll also need to explain why it matters what a bronze age text says. What does any of this have to do with the holocaust?\n\n&gt;not an Abrahamic text and instead is a perverted invention of the Ashkenazi aka \"white Jews\" which they created to retain their Babylonian/Phoenician tenets after being forced to convert to Judaism by a Russian king after they just. wouldn't. stop. being. evil, doing things like murdering merchants on the road and stealing their identity, burning babies on brazen alters of their diety Molech/Ba'al\n\nThe Talmud is an abrahamic text (that is it's within the grander abrahamic canon, along with the qu'ran, Biblical testaments, and other apocryphal texts). It's not a perversion, it's a collection of jewish traditions. They have nothing to do with bablyonians or phonecians, and they definitely aren't performing human sacrifice (which is forbidden by all the abrahamic faiths) or worshipping \"Moloch\" or \"Ba'al\", which are explicitly mentioned multiple times in all abrahamic scripture (originating in the Torah) as false gods. Moloch is a Caananite god, and Ba'al is part of the sumerian pantheon (although the name just means \"lord\", and refers to a number of gods).\n\n&gt;look into how many Jews keep it as a holy book beside actual Judaic texts\n\nIt is one of the texts...\n\n&gt;You will be shocked and a bit sick\n\nWhy? People keep qur'ans, bibles and torahs, and they all say terrible things, and weirdly that doesn't affect me in any way.\n\n&gt;All allied generals said as much after the war.\n\nWhy would anyone fight for the allies if they didn't support them? Especially as a general? And if they had to, why wouldn't they secretly feed info to the enemy?\n\n-----\n\nYou then go on to a different conspiracy where General Patton was... assassinated I guess, it's not clear. I'm certainly not going to read through a metre-long piece of text that's not backed by anything. But again, that has nothing to do with the holocaust, so I'll ignore it for now.\n\n&gt;All of this information is very, very suppressed\n\nIf it's so suppressed how do you know about it? And you just posted it to Reddit, so how is it \"suppressed\" in any way when you can just write it on any social media platform?\n\n&gt;am not \"attacking the Jews\"\n\nWell you claimed they were lying earlier, and your entire position is a general accusation of deceit to the entire world... but sure. I don't care whether you like jews or not, I care that you're denying reality.\n\n&gt;did you know that Israel conscripts all of its youths to censor and attack those who attempt to tell the world the truth of their schemes\n\nCitation needed, and why would they bother when everyone already thinks you guys are lunatics? No one censors crazy people because everyone already knows that you're crazy, they're not taking you seriously.\n\n-----\n\ntl;dr: Nothing you've presented here even comes close to supporting your hypothesis that the holocaust did not occur.", "score": 27, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "unpopularopinion", "date_year_month": "2018-04", "created_utc_converted": "2018-04-20 17:15:33", "score_overall": 16, "words": "jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish holocaust holocaust jewish jewish goyim jew holocaust jewish conspiracy holocaust holocaust", "shared_words": "jewish holocaust goyim jew conspiracy", "socre_distint": 5}

Thats absurd though. According to your logic literally hundreds of millions of people's living grandparents and great grandparents, some of whom ive met and discussed this with, are all in on the same conspiracy to lie about what happened in Europe between 1941 and 1945. But lets set that aside for a moment and talk about Himmler copping to the Holocaust in the Posen speeches.\n\nIn 1943 Himmler delivered a three or four hour long unscripted speech to a crowd of assembled SS officers, which was then typed up, proofread, and distributed to yet more SS officers. Many copies, and an audio recording, survived the war. It's like 150 pages long in English, and as an unscripted speech by an opiate addict of dubious verbal ability its hardly a rhetorical masterpiece. Hitler's speeches, by contrast, are quite a bit more readable.\n\nIn any case, here's the brief part relevant to the Holocaust:\n\n\"I am referring now to the evacuation of the Jews, the extermination of the Jewish people. It is one of those things which is easy to talk about.  \u2018The Jewish people will be exterminated,\u2019 says every Party comrade, \u2018It\u2019s clear, it\u2019s in our programme.

The atrocities of the Allies were more brutal, painful, mortal and numerous than the most extreme allegations made against the Germans. The Nazi treatment of Jews was no different from what the Allies did to their enemies in World War II.   \n\n&gt;* Israeli politicians [men like Edgar Bronfman] derived billions of dollars from nonexistent, mythical and imaginary cadavers, whose numbers have been reckoned in an unusually distorted and dishonest manner  \n\n&gt;* There was no German program to exterminate Europe\u2019s Jews, and the estimate of six million Jewish wartime dead is an irresponsible exaggeration. The Holocaust \u2013 the alleged extermination of some six million Jews (most of them by gassing) \u2013 is a hoax and should be recognized as such.  \n\n&gt;* The gas chambers used by the Nazis to exterminate the Jews did not exist. There were no execution gas chambers in Auschwitz or in any other concentration camp. Today, what are displayed as \u2018gas chambers\u2019 at the remains of the Auschwitz camp in Poland are a post-war fabrication by the Polish communist regime or the Soviet Union.  Neither at Auschwitz nor in any territory controlled by the Germans was there \u2018mass murder of Jews\u2019 in \u2018gas chambers.\u2019 Mr. Raniere admits there were scattered killings. But most who died at Auschwitz were the victims of \u201cnatural causes\u201d such as disease, not gassing. The death of some Jews were due to the typhus plague during the war and the famine towards the end of the war caused by the defeat of the Germans.  \n\n&gt;* The majority of documentation relating to the operation of the gas chambers in death camps, is \u201crare\u201d and \u201cunreliable\u201d \u2013 and based upon misleading evidence, false statements, and outright lies.\nThe Zionists fabricated a legend, under the name of the Massacre of the Jews. It is myth.

{"archived": false, "author": "BadBetting", "body": "1. CLASSIFICATION: All cultures have categories to distinguish people into \u201cus and them\u201d by ethnicity, race, religion, or nationality: German and Jew, Hutu and Tutsi. Bipolar societies that lack mixed categories, such as Rwanda and Burundi, are the most likely to have genocide. The main preventive measure at this early stage is to develop universalistic institutions that transcend ethnic or racial divisions, that actively promote tolerance and understanding, and that promote classifications that transcend the divisions. The Catholic church could have played this role in Rwanda, had it not been riven by the same ethnic cleavages as Rwandan society. Promotion of a common language in countries like Tanzania has also promoted transcendent national identity. This search for common ground is vital to early prevention of genocide.\n\n2. SYMBOLIZATION: We give names or other symbols to the classifications. We name people \u201cJews\u201d or \u201cGypsies\u201d, or distinguish them by colors or dress; and apply the symbols to members of groups. Classification and symbolization are universally human and do not necessarily result in genocide unless they lead to  dehumanization. When combined with hatred, symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of pariah groups: the yellow star for Jews under Nazi rule, the blue scarf for people from the Eastern Zone in Khmer Rouge Cambodia. To combat symbolization, hate symbols can be legally forbidden (swastikas) as can hate speech. Group marking like gang clothing or tribal scarring can be outlawed, as well. The problem is that legal limitations will fail if unsupported by popular cultural enforcement. Though Hutu and Tutsi were forbidden words in Burundi until the 1980\u2019s, code words replaced them. If widely supported, however, denial of symbolization can be powerful, as it was in Bulgaria, where the government refused to supply enough yellow badges and at least eighty percent of Jews did not wear them, depriving the yellow star of its significance as a Nazi symbol for Jews.\n\n3. DISCRIMINATION: A dominant group uses law, custom, and political power to deny the rights of other groups.  The powerless group may not be accorded full civil rights or even citizenship. Examples include the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 in Nazi Germany, which stripped Jews of their German citizenship, and prohibited their employment by the government and by universities.  Denial of citizenship to the Rohingya Muslim minority in Burma is another example.  Prevention against discrimination means full political empowerment and citizenship rights for all groups in a society.  Discrimination on the basis of nationality, ethnicity, race or religion should be outlawed.  Individuals should have the right to sue the state, corporations, and other individuals if their rights are violated.\n\n4. DEHUMANIZATION: One group denies the humanity of the other group. Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects or diseases. Dehumanization overcomes the normal human revulsion against murder. At this stage, hate propaganda in print and on hate radios is used to vilify the victim group. In combating this dehumanization, incitement to genocide should not be confused with protected speech. Genocidal societies lack constitutional protection for countervailing speech, and should be treated differently than democracies. Local and international leaders should condemn the use of hate speech and make it culturally unacceptable. Leaders who incite genocide should be banned from international travel and have their foreign finances frozen. Hate radio stations should be shut down, and hate propaganda banned. Hate crimes and atrocities should be promptly punished.\n\n5. ORGANIZATION: Genocide is always organized, usually by the state, often using militias to provide deniability of state responsibility (the Janjaweed in Darfur.) Sometimes organization is informal (Hindu mobs led by local RSS militants) or decentralized (terrorist groups.) Special army units or militias are often trained and armed. Plans are made for genocidal killings. To combat this stage, membership in these militias should be outlawed. Their leaders should be denied visas for foreign travel. The U.N. should impose arms embargoes on governments and citizens of countries involved in genocidal massacres, and create commissions to investigate violations, as was done in post-genocide Rwanda.\n\n6. POLARIZATION: Extremists drive the groups apart. Hate groups broadcast polarizing propaganda. Laws may forbid intermarriage or social interaction. Extremist terrorism targets moderates, intimidating and silencing the center. Moderates from the perpetrators\u2019 own group are most able to stop genocide, so are the first to be arrested and killed. Prevention may mean security protection for moderate leaders or assistance to human rights groups. Assets of extremists may be seized, and visas for international travel denied to them. Coups d\u2019\u00e9tat by extremists should be opposed by international sanctions.\n\n7.  PREPARATION:  National or perpetrator group leaders plan the \u201cFinal Solution\u201d to the Jewish, Armenian, Tutsi or other targeted group \u201cquestion.\u201d  They often use euphemisms to cloak their intentions, such as referring to their goals as \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d \u201cpurification,\u201d or \u201ccounter-terrorism.\u201d  They build armies, buy weapons and train their troops and militias.  They indoctrinate the populace with fear of the victim group.  Leaders often claim that \u201cif we don\u2019t kill them, they will kill us.\u201d  Prevention of preparation may include arms embargos and commissions to enforce them.  It should include prosecution of incitement and conspiracy to commit genocide, both crimes under Article 3 of the Genocide Convention.\n\n8. PERSECUTION: Victims are identified and separated out because of their ethnic or religious identity. Death lists are drawn up. In state sponsored genocide, members of victim groups may be forced to wear identifying symbols. Their property is often expropriated. Sometimes they are even segregated into ghettoes, deported into concentration camps, or confined to a famine-struck region and starved.  Genocidal massacres begin.  They are acts of genocide because they intentionally destroy part of a group.  At this stage, a Genocide Emergency must be declared. If the political will of the great powers, regional alliances, or the U.N. Security Council can be mobilized, armed international intervention should be prepared, or heavy assistance provided to the victim group to prepare for its self-defense. Humanitarian assistance should be organized by the U.N. and private relief groups for the inevitable tide of refugees to come.\n\n9. EXTERMINATION begins, and quickly becomes the mass killing legally called \u201cgenocide.\u201d It is \u201cextermination\u201d to the killers because they do not believe their victims to be fully human. When it is sponsored by the state, the armed forces often work with militias to do the killing. Sometimes the genocide results in revenge killings by groups against each other, creating the downward whirlpool-like cycle of bilateral genocide (as in Burundi). At this stage, only rapid and overwhelming armed intervention can stop genocide. Real safe areas or refugee escape corridors should be established with heavily armed international protection. (An unsafe \u201csafe\u201d area is worse than none at all.) The U.N. Standing High Readiness Brigade, EU Rapid Response Force, or regional forces -- should be authorized to act by the U.N. Security Council if the genocide is small. For larger interventions, a multilateral force authorized by the U.N. should intervene. If the U.N. is paralyzed, regional alliances must act. It is time to recognize that the international responsibility to protect transcends the narrow interests of individual nation states. If strong nations will not provide troops to intervene directly, they should provide the airlift, equipment, and financial means necessary for regional states to intervene.\n\n10. DENIAL is the final stage that lasts throughout and always follows a genocide. It is among the surest indicators of further genocidal massacres. The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves, burn the bodies, try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses. They deny that they committed any crimes, and often blame what happened on the victims. They block investigations of the crimes, and continue to govern until driven from power by force, when they flee into exile. There they remain with impunity, like Pol Pot or Idi Amin, unless they are captured and a tribunal is established to try them. The response to denial is punishment by an international tribunal or national courts. There the evidence can be heard, and the perpetrators punished. Tribunals like the Yugoslav or Rwanda Tribunals, or an international tribunal to try the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, or an International Criminal Court may not deter the worst genocidal killers. But with the political will to arrest and prosecute them, some may be brought to justice.\n\n\nTen steps of a genocide", "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "politics", "date_year_month": "2018-04", "created_utc_converted": "2018-04-22 02:07:05", "score_overall": 4, "words": "jew silencing jewish conspiracy", "shared_words": "jew silencing jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

Why believe someone who studies these texts, when you can believe someone who *doesn't* study these texts. Spoken like a true sheep!\n\n&gt; Not bad. Honestly. But you know what gives you away?\n&gt; \n&gt; You can't live a whole life steeped in Talmudic doctrine and not have it show when you deal with the Goyim. The hatred. The revulsion. The conceit. It etches itself into Jewish faces and conduct. It seeps through around the edges as it has in your comment.\n\nNo, I totally get that. It must be really hard. I do look down on you antisemitic ignorant sheep. I think you're low scum. I'm not going to say I'd go so far as to hate you as I don't think it's your fault. You're just pathetic.\n\n&gt; Your words mean little. Meanwhile the heaped historical precedents\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; speak volumes.\n\nYeah, of course you'd go for this stuff.\n\nIt's not Paul Warburg who said it it's James Warburg and the \"we\" in his statement seems to refer to the US, no the Jews. You can actually read the transcript online\n\nNoel Ignatiev is talking about the social construct. He doesn't believe that \"race\" actually exists. He's talking about \"white privilege\" that society bestows on certain people of a class that he believes is nothing more than a social construct.\n\nIshmael Levitts doesn't exist. And the first name is kind of telling, as we haven't used that name in a really really long time.\n\nSamuel Roth was a self-hating Jew after he felt Jews turned on him.\n\nKarl Marx was born an irreligious Jew and eventually became a convert to Christianity. He wouldn't care about the Talmud. It's obvious this quote was made up.\n\nRabbi Emanuel Rabinovich was created by Eustace Mullins.\n\nRichard von Coudenhove was not Jewish and was a proponent of racial admixture.

This is universally agreed upon as a bad thing to do.\n\nColonization is a group of foreigners coming to your homeland and taking it over politically and economically. If the native people complain, they get beaten/jailed/killed.\n\nThat sounds a lot like what we have now with mass immigration doesn't it? Mass immigration is absolutely a form on colonization. When every immigrant and his family members get 1 vote each, and their demographic is ever increasing, they now have the power to dictate how the country will run.

This policy literally gives non-whites non-whites jobs/education even though they haven't met the merit based criteria set for whites. \n\nAffirmative action is a racial policy, it is not merit based what so ever. For every job that is given to a non-white BECAUSE he/she is non-white, that means one job isn't given to whites BECAUSE he/she is white.\n\n&gt; Another question, what is the end game for replacing \"whites\"? Why would anyone who is in control of this mess or that has power to influence this mess want to get rid of \"whites\" as the people in control and who have power are white. What would be the logic in this.\n\nBecause the people in power aren't white. They are Jewish.

{"archived": false, "author": "TheBlackerBerrie", "body": "I am kind of torn in calling any of these guys anti-semitic because it depends on the context and interpretation of lyrics and statements (also on the separation between art and artist). \n\nMy point was that IF Kollegah is antisemitic so must be Prinz Porno.\n\nThe reason is that the definition of anti-semitism is \"hostility toward or\u00a0discrimination\u00a0against Jews as a religious or racial group\". Now, being strict with this definition I do not see any of these artists complying with it. I am not aware of statements in which any of these artists told people to hurt jews or made a difference between jews and non-jews on account of their race. \n\nHowever, the history of anti-semitism is long and rich (and pretty horrible). Many people see it as dicriminatory to allude to these old images, like the ugly jew with big nose and ears, the money grabber, the world conspiracy, the Jewish communist, and many more. Also, there is a debate about the state of Israel with its contentious history. The debate is so old that in the German leftist movement there are even own names for the two sides of the issue: Antimperialists and Antigermans.\n\nAntimperialist think that any kind of nationalist state that surpresses and kills people is despicable and should be disposed. Thus they feel like Palestine has to be protected from the Isaeli occupation and that the what Israel calls terror is a fight for liberation. A often cited sentiment is that the Holocaust places humanity in the responsibility to never again allow another such crime (\"Nie wieder Krieg, Nie wieder Auschwitz\").\n\nAntigermans, on the other hand, think that because of the holocaust jews need their own country and have every right to defend themselves against their surrounding enemies as their declared goal of these enemies is to obliterate the jews. They also think that criticism towards Israel's behavior is equivalent to thinly veiled antisemitism. If a Kollegah now travels to palestine and produces an hour long documentary about the supression of Palestinians by Israel, this would be considered an advertisement for terrorism against jews and thus, you guessed it, anti-semitism.\n\nEdit: a contribution to this debate that might elude some of these positions, antimperialist rappers against Antigermans: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q7OS6dnTyk\n\nThe German party \"the left\" (and some of the Green party) has exactly this problem: an antigerman (muslim immigration leads to enemies of jews in Germany) and an antimperialist wing ( no borders, no nation, no oppression etc) and these positions are pretty incompatible.\n\nTo get back to your question: all of these rappers have in their lyrics or statements done both: alluded to these historical stereotypes about jews and argued against Israeli policy in Palestine. Which are positions that at least 40-50 German parliamentarians hold, so there are probably more representative figure heads that one could argue against (of course Kollegah and Farid are much more plakative figures to condemn). You could easily make the same allegations towards eg Kendrick Lamar who is in this debate so often cited as the \"good\" rapper, the counterpart to Kollegah's \"plump anti-semitism\". \n\nSpecifically Prinz Porno:\nGenerally, his lyrics heavily feature conspiracy theories (Keine Liebe etc) and stereotypes of a bad shady financial system and bankers. Of course I always thought of this as ironic, but today everything and nothing is satire (also he has been doing that for a long time now, wo who knows). He often alludes to global capitalism and the 'power of the dollar', to the US government as \"wolf in sheep's clothing\" etc. So his lyrics are pretty standard antimperialist messages, that, as I explained before a large chunk of German leftists find to be antisemitic. He also supports standard antimperialist causes like Palestinian youth organization sharek. \nEspecially these lines have inflamed Antigermans:\n\n\u201eDer Gott des Geldes kennt kein Erbarmen. / Das ist nicht der Gott aus den heiligen Schriften, / sondern der globalisierte Gott des Dollars, / der Gott des Rubels, des Euros, / der Abu-Ghraib folgt, Prinz Pi, Sympathie f\u00fcr Hisbollah [\u2026]\u201c\n\nHere are some of the blogs that make this point eloquently:\n\nhttps://www.kotzendes-einhorn.de/blog/2015-08/wenn-wir-uns-ueber-xaviers-ansichten-lustig-machen-koennen-wir-dann-bitte-auch-ueber-prinz-pi-lachen/\n\nhttps://rothschildraptiloid.wordpress.com/2016/12/18/prinz-pi-und-die-vernichtung-israels/\n\n\nSo, to sum up, without many of the commentators themselves realising they find themselves in the middle of a old and ugly discussion. I can't really make up my mind either what to make of it, but what I can say for sure is that I do not understand why two rappers receive all the attacks (especially from those that only focus on one harmless line) while the antisemitism, that could reasonably be pointed out here, happens right before their eyes, in politics on all levels and in art and media of all sorts (not only rap, the German comedy television program  \"The Anstalt\" comes to mind with their conspiracy theory tropes). \n\nSorry for the PhD thesis but this was the article I was waiting to read in German newspaper regarding this scandal.\n", "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "germany", "date_year_month": "2018-04", "created_utc_converted": "2018-04-27 21:49:39", "score_overall": 7, "words": "jew conspiracy jewish holocaust holocaust conspiracy conspiracy", "shared_words": "jew conspiracy jewish holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}

Their view of the person in their sights and the justification that they are able to supply to themselves is one that is instilled by the *culture* in Israel, and even when held accountable for what is in essence a murder, the paltry punishment that they receive simply reinforces and justifies that *culture*.  But it's the truth. I really don't think people understand that kids in the IDF are taught to murder. They are taught that killing is the goal. They are taught that violence is okay, as long as it means taking a Palestinian's life.\n\n&gt; The problem is not religion, the problem is not \"zionism\" (which is a word that has been perverted to mean something derogatory, and does not actually mean what you seem to think it means)\n\n First of all let's address Zionism which you conveniently and patronizingly tell me that I do not understand the definition of whilst offering no alternative. You are correct in that its received definition has morphed somewhat since its inception as an organized movement in the 1890s by Birnbaum and Herzl and as such Zionism does not have a uniform ideology, but has evolved in a dialogue among a plethora of ideologies: General Zionism, Religious Zionism, Labor Zionism, Revisionist Zionism, Green Zionism, etc. yet its base general definition remains the same:\n\n&gt;Zionism is the national movement of the Jewish people that supports the re-establishment of a Jewish homeland in Eretz Yisrael, the territory defined as the historic Land of Israel (roughly corresponding to Canaan, the Holy Land, or the region of Palestine). A religious variety of Zionism supports Jews upholding their Jewish identity defined as adherence to religious Judaism, opposes the assimilation of Jews into other societies, and has advocated the return of Jews to Israel as a means for Jews to be a majority nation in their own state. A variety of Zionism, called cultural Zionism, founded and represented most prominently by Ahad Ha'am, fostered a secular vision of a Jewish \"spiritual centre\" in Israel. Unlike Herzl, the founder of political Zionism, Ahad Ha'am strived for Israel to be \"a Jewish state and not merely a state of Jews\", ie an 'ethno-state'.\n\nAll of this is redolent of *lebensraum* and associated practices with parallels being abundantly clear.[ Don't even bother with shouts of Godwin- yet another tactic used to attempt to silence valid criticism along with blanket 'anti-semitism'.]\n\nAdvocates of Zionism view it as a national liberation movement for the repatriation of a persecuted people residing as minorities in a variety of nations to their ancestral homeland. Critics of Zionism view it as a colonialist, racist and exceptionalist ideology that led advocates to violence during Mandatory Palestine, followed by the exodus of Palestinians, and the subsequent denial of their right to return to property lost during the 1948 war.\n\nEven well respected Rabbis and other members of the Judaic faith are [outspoken in their condemnation of this ethos](http://www.truetorahjews.org/tags/rabbinic-quotations) and view it as a betrayal of the values of the Torah.\n\nLike Christianity and Islam, Judaism has at its core a set of moral values and ethical principles. Zionism is Jewish nationalism which can take the form of a sectarian, colonial enterprise which, in the process of creating and then expanding in the Arab heartland a state for some Jews, made a mockery of Judaism's moral values and ethical principles and demonstrated contempt for international law and the human and political rights of the Palestinians. That's why, for example, Nazi holocaust survivor [Dr. Hajo Meyer] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSlFR541Uoo) titled his final book [An Ethical Tradition Betrayed, The End of Judaism](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/hajo-meyer/an-ethical-tradition-betr_b_438660.html).\n\nAlso seeing as you like conspiracy theories so much, like the way you have first hand knowledge of the amount of money owned by Hamas and their deliberate refusal to use it to help Palestinians in an effort to propagate the political stalemate in the region, perhaps you could comment on the attempt by the Israeli state (as touched upon by some of the Rabbis I referenced earlier) to deliberately equate any criticism of the State of Israel with anti-semitism? A deliberate ploy to inflate the levels of actual anti-semitism and create a climate of fear in the hope of encouraging more Jews to migrate to Israel where they would feel safer, whilst adding more numbers to underline the necessity of continued land-grabs and expanding settlements in the name of *lebensraum*.\n\nExactly how do you know that Hamas has all this money and refuses to spend it, where is your proof? I make no excuses for Hamas or their methods or goals (I have repeatedly made clear that I can simply understand to some degree due to historical factors why the situation in the area has become so toxic), however casting such aspersions with no evidence has about as much relevance as accusing Jews of blood libel.", "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "news", "date_year_month": "2018-04", "created_utc_converted": "2018-04-29 18:14:02", "score_overall": 9, "words": "jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish holocaust conspiracy libel", "shared_words": "jewish holocaust conspiracy libel", "socre_distint": 4}

Note: I corrected three mis-translated names in paragraph 1.) \n\nFrom Google translate :  \n\n\"And in the Kingdom of the Khazars in the ninth century, this kingdom was not religious, and then became a Jewish kingdom, Judaism, and then dispersed and migrated all its inhabitants to Europe, and these are the Ashkenazi Jews, not Semitic and have nothing to do with the  or our Lord (/forefather) Abraham and (Jacob). Khazar was not religious and became Jewish, and the Jews became the promised land, and this is what the Zionist Kostler said.\n\nThose Jews who moved to Eastern and Western Europe were subjected every 10 to 15 years to a massacre of a state, from the 11th century until the Holocaust that happened, and why did it happen? They say \"because we are Jews,\" I want to bring three Jews with three books, including Joseph Stalin, Abraham and Isaac Notchard, who say hatred of Jews is not because of their religion. But because of their social function, if the Jewish issue that was prevalent in Europe against Jews is not because of their religion but because of usury and banks. Proof of that  is that there were Jews in the Arab countries, I challenge that there was a case against the Jews in the Arab world 1400 years ago because they are Jews in any Arab country.\n\nHistory tells us that there is no basis for the Jewish homeland. The first evidence of a Jewish state was called by the British leader Cromwell in 1653. He said: \"We want to establish a Jewish state in Palestine and no one agrees to it,\" and then Napoleon Bonaparte, the grandfather of the grandfather, and later the US consul in Jerusalem in 1850. And in Palestine, all those who call for a Jewish state are not Jews.\n\nAnd we arrive in Balfour, before his promise was issued a decision to prevent the Jews from entering Britain because he hates the Jews for these reasons, and then came Balfour and promised came with the participation of the US President and the consultation of the French and Italian President, Shawar four countries, and here we come to the issue of the British Prime Minister. In 1905, the presidents, ministers of foreign affairs and ministers of defense of European countries met for two years in Britain. The title is that the European civilization is capable of falling and is worthy to be replaced by the countries of the east and south of the Mediterranean because of its strategic position. In order to prevent this, we must keep this country fragmented and backward. This is what we are today. As a quick solution, we must cultivate eastern Suez as a strange people for its people. They are Jews. Therefore, the Balfour Declaration came and was adopted by Britain. It was implemented in 1947 by partition decision, and there were many issues that confirm that this project is an investment project.\n\nI want to surprise you. In 1933, after Hitler came to power for a month, an agreement was reached between the German Ministry of Economy and the Anglo-Palestine Bank in Jerusalem. Any German Jew would like to emigrate to Palestine to transfer his movable and immovable property to Palestine.\u00a0If he did not want to give a ticket to Belgium, and wanted to be this new home loyal to him .. And emigrated within six years about 60 thousand Germans at the time.\u00a0Balfour hated the Jews, wanted to establish a state for them, and the Russian foreign minister known for his hatred of the Jews wanted a state in Palestine.\u00a0The fact that the project was colonial came to implant a foreign body in the country.\"\n\n", "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Palestine", "date_year_month": "2018-05", "created_utc_converted": "2018-05-02 11:51:22", "score_overall": 10, "words": "khazars jewish jewish holocaust jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jew", "shared_words": "khazars jewish holocaust jew", "socre_distint": 4}

Friedman, the United States ambassador to Israel, said Mr. Abbas had \u201creached a new low,\u201d adding, \u201cTo all those who think Israel is the reason that we don\u2019t have peace, think again.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Abbas is presiding over the first regular meeting of the Palestine National Council in 22 years. It may well be his last. (The council convened for a more limited, \u201cextraordinary\u201d session in 2009 to replace six members of its 18-member executive committee who had died in the meantime.)\n&gt; \n&gt; On the eve of the four-day gathering of about 700 council delegates in Ramallah, an Abbas adviser promoted it as a historic meeting dedicated to Palestinian unity, democracy and setting strategy for the coming months and years.\n&gt; \n&gt; It seemed to have started out as anything but that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead, it was taking place with a deeply splintered Palestinian leadership that has turned away from Washington because of President Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and is largely disconnected from its own public. A March opinion poll found that 68 percent of Palestinians want Mr. Abbas to resign from office.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Palestinian Authority has looked on while its archrival, Hamas, the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza, has seized the popular initiative and focused international attention on the isolated and impoverished coastal enclave with its promotion of the so-called Great Return March. More than 40 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds have been wounded, many shot in the legs, by Israeli snipers over the past month during partly peaceful, partly violent protests along the Gaza border.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Abbas has long advocated nonviolent popular resistance against the Israeli occupation but is also wary of protests, fearing they could spiral out of control and be detrimental to the cause, or even turn against him, according to experts.\n&gt; \n&gt; So he has found himself in the awkward position of trying to both pay lip service to, and dampen the enthusiasm for, the Gaza protests. In his speech he warned the children of Gaza to stay away from the border fence because \u201cI do not want a disabled generation.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Yet the weeks ahead could prove explosive. The United States is scheduled to open its embassy in Jerusalem on May 14, the 70th anniversary of Israel\u2019s foundation, in a move that has infuriated the Palestinians. The Great Return March is expected to peak on May 15, when Palestinians mark the 70th anniversary of what they call the Nakba, or \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d of the 1948 war when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians left or were expelled from their homes in what is now Israel.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Israeli military is bracing for a potential mass breach of its border fence with Gaza. The possible fallout in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, coinciding with the start of the holy month of Ramadan, is unpredictable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Abbas has, in the meantime, ruled out an American monopoly over brokering Israeli-Palestinian negotiations because of the embassy move, and he has already rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s long-awaited peace plan before it has been presented, expecting less favorable terms than have been offered in the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aging and increasingly frail \u2014 Palestinian officials say an ambulance is now part of the president\u2019s traveling detail \u2014 Mr. Abbas has offered few inspiring alternatives and a succession battle is already underway.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cIt certainly feels like a very low point for the Palestinian national movement,\u201d said Nathan Thrall, director of the International Crisis Group\u2019s Israeli-Palestinian project. \u201cFragmentation and weakness,\u201d he said, \u201cjust pervades the entire meeting.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Abbas\u2019s speech, Mr. Thrall said, was \u201cjust a simple reflection of an embittered leader at the end of his tenure whose life project has come to failure.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time, Mr. Thrall said, appearing defiant and having the United States condemn him will not harm Mr. Abbas domestically.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Palestine National Council had not convened for years because many Palestinians wanted to wait for a genuine reconciliation between Mr. Abbas\u2019s Fatah party and Hamas, which would have granted Hamas substantial representation in the P.L.O. Those efforts have also failed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aides to Mr. Abbas said it was necessary to meet now nevertheless, to replace 103 members of the roughly 700-member council, including more than 80 who have died.\n&gt; \n&gt; The last regular meeting took place in 1996 in Gaza, during what were considered the \u201cgood years\u201d of the Oslo peace process, which was meant to lead to a permanent peace settlement by the end of the 20th century.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since then Mr. Abbas has lost much of the traditional support of many Arab states and has been facing increasingly right-wing Israeli governments that are unwilling to make concessions.\n&gt; \n&gt; At an international conference organized by the P.L.O. on the eve of the council meeting, Palestinian officials and experts spoke gloomily to a half-empty hall in a Ramallah hotel about what went wrong and bemoaned the fate of the moribund organization.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cInstead of blaming the major powers we should blame ourselves,\u201d said Asad Abdul Rahman, a Jordan-based delegate.

Take it from a Jew, and many others can tell you the same.\n\n&gt;I mean, I read a lot about how anti semitism is a big problem but I don\u2019t really see any examples.\n\nNo offence, but it may be that you don't recognise them. In some cases (such as Wadsworth) they use particular antisemitic attacks that don't seem particularly problematic out of context. Also, even if you don't see it, that really isn't evidence at all about the general trend. The fact is that many Jews do see it, and are calling Labour out on their failure to deal with it.\n\n&gt;Do labour politicians really advocate anti Semitic policy? I\u2019ve never seen any. Is anyone actually saying we should discriminate against Jews?\n\nPolicy? No. Accusing Jewish MP's of collaborating with the right wing to bring down the party, and that they can't be trusted (an old and standard antisemitic conspiracy theory), yes. A whitewash of an inquiry? Yes. Failing to kick out someone who speaks bigoted lies most often used by holocaust deniers? Yes. There are other examples as well, but the problem is that the leadership has been pathetically slow to act. Then you have people like walker...\n\nThere is also the fact that many are trying to paint it as a giant conspiracy by Israel, the Jewish state, to bring down Corbyn, which is frankly pathetic.\n\n&gt;I saw the mural thing, which obviously wasnt good, but as far as I can see it was quite a while ago, and more a case of bad judgment than actually advocating discrimination.\n\nThe problem is that Corbyn should have seen that blatantly antisemitic stereotypes there, as well as the fact that the creator said it was antisemitic. hanging his line on what happened doesn't help his cause.\n\n&gt;I also don\u2019t think criticising Israeli policy is necessarily anti Semitic since they have a super right wing government and demonstratively do some pretty terrible things regularly.\n\nAgreed entirely.

Given that the only reason it does is because Jews saw they needed it to be safe, this is not on.\n\n&gt;But yes I do think the constant battering labour get in the press over it weakens us at the polls.\n\nThe only reason this battering happens is because Labour doesn't deal with it. To you this is losing votes.

This is about kicking out bigots and making the Labour party a safe place for minorities. Currently it is becoming a safe place for antisemites and has caused many Jews to worry about their future in this country.\n\nDo you realise the scale of the problem?\n\n&gt;Do we really have to help the Tories defeat us?\n\nThis is the problem in a nutshell. That people like you are putting winning votes over people's lives, even if unwittingly. Would you say the same for any other minority?

Some forms of speech aren't appropriate in certain forums because they only serve to derail the conversation. It's up to subreddit moderators as to what kind of environment they want to foster.

Now imagine you appeal to your boss who tells you that your coworker has an inalienable right to free-speech and that a hostile work environment is an unfortunate consequence of this. In this situation you would either react emotionally, come to work with a persistent sense of fear and anxiety or *quit your job*. Normalizing hate-speech has a silencing effect on its victims. Ultimately, we have to pick sides.\n\nIn an academic context or in online spaces, a jewish person should not have to intellectually debate a Nazi on whether or not they should be *gassed*. Nor do I think a black person should not have to refute the idea that they're a different species. Similarly, a transgender person should not have to defend the validity of their gender identity. \n\nThe question shouldn't be about free speech because free speech doesn't exist in practice. The USA has the most generous protections for speech in the western world yet there are laws related to \u201cobscenity, incitement to violence, copyright infringement, press censorship during wartime, whistleblowing\u201d and \u201crestrictions for the incarcerated.\" More importantly, private forums have a range of criteria in order for people to gain a platform.

A Levite is given precedence over an Israelite...When does the above apply? When the two [captives] were equal in knowledge.

The chutzpah of a needy kollel man or yeshivah collector doesn't relate to your personal obligation as a Jewish person to support Torah learning whomever it is.

{"archived": false, "author": "pizzashill", "body": "It isn't just Christians you mongoloid. It's any majority. Jews have historically been a convenient scapegoat/minority in many countries.\n\nFor an example:\n\n&gt; Superstition and prejudice toward Jews dates back to the earliest years of Christianity. Saint John Chrysostom, a fourth-century preacher widely admired for his eloquence, eloquently denounced Jews as baby-killing devil worshipers. In 1215, Pope Innocent III was concerned that Christians might find themselves unwittingly having relations with Jews. His solution was to make Jews wear distinguishing clothing, leading to the yellow \u201cbadge of shame\u201d that many Jewish people around Europe were required to wear throughout the Dark Ages\u2014and again under the Nazis. A couple of decades later, Pope Gregory IX established the Inquisition, a formalized effort to prosecute heresy against the Roman Catholic Church, which eventually led to mass executions of Jews, among other accused heretics, and mass burnings of their holy books.\n\n&gt; According to the pious logic of some medieval theologians, the Jewish Talmud was both blasphemous and, paradoxically, a testament to the truth of Christian teaching. Just as the Devil knows the truth of Christianity but is determined to deny it and destroy those who believe it, so too, Christian scholars argued, do the Jews. People came to see Jews as being in league with Satan, possessing arcane knowledge and black magic, and harboring an unquenchable hatred for Christianity. Allegations that Jewish people were plotting against Christians became commonplace.\nOne popular theory had it that Jews were in the habit of poisoning Christian drinking wells. \n\n&gt; When the Black Plague ravaged fourteenth-century Europe, outbreaks were often blamed on the international Jewish well-poisoning conspiracy. In some cases, torturers coerced confessions from a handful of Jewish suspects, on the basis of which thousands more were burned alive. The worst of the pogroms was in Strasbourg. Fear-stricken locals, desperate to prevent the plague from reaching them, decided to preemptively slaughter the town\u2019s Jews. (Some of the town\u2019s nobility were also in debt to Jewish money-lenders, and may have seen an opportunity to clear their tab.) City authorities attempted to intervene but couldn\u2019t hold the mob at bay. All told, around nine hundred Jewish people were burned alive, and the rest were baptized or banished. The plague soon swept through town regardless, leaving sixteen thousand people dead in its wake.\n\n&gt; There was also the \u201cblood libel\u201d\u2014the allegation that Jewish people routinely murder Christians and drain them of their blood, which they allegedly used to make the Passover meal, to make medicine to heal their physical defects, or to perform unholy rituals. The myth was invented in the twelfth century, when a young Christian boy was found dead on the outskirts of Norwich, England, the day before Easter Sunday. Thomas of Monmouth, a Benedictine monk turned amateur detective, offered a convoluted explanation. Jewish teaching, he claimed, asserts that Jews must spill Christian blood in order to regain their homeland. Thus, a secret council of Jewish elites convenes once a year to select a sacrificial Christian child. Monmouth\u2019s idea caught on. For centuries thereafter, whenever a Christian child went missing or turned up dead, local Jews were often the first suspects.\n\n&gt; These religiously motivated fears circulated for centuries. Meanwhile, Jews in many regions were denied citizenship and property rights, confined to ghettos, or banished from Christian society altogether. This began to change in the wake of the French Revolution, when many Jewish people were granted basic human rights and began to emerge from isolation. They naturally tended to favor liberal and democratic political policies that represented their best hope of increasing liberty. Still sidelined from traditional occupations, many migrated to the cities and pioneered inventive new ways of making a living. While most remained impoverished and out of sight, a few became extremely wealthy.\n\n&gt; This all led to new social tensions. A lot of people weren\u2019t thrilled about the radical changes taking place around them. For some, the newly integrated Jews became a defining symbol of the modern world. The age-old prejudice that had given rise to the blood libel and well-poisoning myths was reinvigorated and updated to reflect modern anxieties and resentments. Jews were no longer enemies of God, but enemies of man.

They are known \\(to everyone but themselves\\) as Holocaust deniers.\n\nHere are some basic [tenets](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10008003) of Holocaust denialism \\(via\u00a0the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\\):\n\n&gt;\u201cHolocaust denial\u201d describes attempts to negate the  established facts of the Nazi genocide of European Jewry. Common denial  assertions are: that the murder of six million Jews during World War II  never occurred; that the Nazis had no official policy or intention to  exterminate the Jews; and that the poison gas chambers in  Auschwitz\\-Birkenau death camp never existed. A newer trend is the distortion of the facts of the Holocaust. Common  distortions include, for example, assertions that: the figure of six  million Jewish deaths is an exaggeration; deaths in the concentration  camps were the results of disease or starvation but not policy; and that  the diary of Anne Frank is a forgery.\n\nThe\u00a0deniers aren\u2019t known for their subtlety. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason to be tasteful about Auschwitz,\u201d [said](http://www.fpp.co.uk/Legal/Penguin/opening/Rampton1.html) author, anti\\-Semite, and Holocaust denier David Irving in 1991. He continued:\n\n&gt;It\u2019s baloney, it\u2019s a legend. Once we admit the fact that  it was a brutal slave labor camp and large numbers of people did die, as  large numbers of innocent people died elsewhere in the War, why believe  the rest of the baloney? I say quite tastelessly, in fact, that more women died on the back  seat of Edward Kennedy\u2019s car at Chappaquiddick than ever died in a gas  chamber in Auschwitz.\n\nAt a 2006 [conference](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/12/13/kkk-david-duke-tells-iran-holocaust-conference-that-gas-chambers-not-used-to.html)  of Holocaust deniers in Iran hosted by\u00a0President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,  the country\u2019s former interior minister said, without irony, \u201cAll the  studies and research carried out so far have proven that there is no  reason to believe that the Holocaust ever occurred and that it is only a  tale.\u201d\n\nOthers at the\u00a0conference\u00a0admitted the killings took place, but claimed the numbers were inflated:\u00a0\n\n&gt;Frederick Toben, an Australian who in 1999 served jail  time in Germany for his Holocaust views, told the conference in no  uncertain terms that the number of Jews killed in Nazi death camps \u2014 an  estimated 6 million \u2014 is a myth. \u201dThe number of victims at the Auschwitz concentration camp could be  about 2,007,\u201d Toben said. \u201dThe railroad to the camp did not have enough  capacity to transfer large numbers of Jews.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t mistake these for sincere historical quibbles. They\u00a0are direct misstatements of the evidentiary\u00a0[record](https://www.phdn.org/archives/holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/index.html) \u2014 a record whose existence, again, we owe in large part\u00a0to the Nazis themselves.\n\n## \u201cExtermination, we\u2019re doing it\u201d\n\nBoth propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and SS chief Heinrich  Himmler, for example, admitted\u00a0there\u00a0was an official plan to  exterminate\u00a0the Jewish population. \u201cThe Jews have deserved the  catastrophe that has now overtaken them,\u201d Goebbels [wrote](https://books.google.com/books?id=Hyg98sfH3CAC&amp;pg=PA310#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)  in his diary in 1942. \u201cNot much will remain of the Jews. On the whole  it can be said that about 60 percent of them will have to be liquidated  whereas only 40 percent can be used for forced labor.\u201d\n\nChillingly, Himmler said [this](https://books.google.com/books?id=v7saCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT702#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)\u00a0in a 1943 speech in Posen, Poland:\n\n&gt;I refer now to the evacuation of the Jews, the  extermination of the Jewish people. This is one of those things that is  easily said: \u201cthe Jewish people are being exterminated,\u201d says every  Party member, \u201cquite true, it\u2019s part of our plans, the elimination of  the Jews, extermination, we\u2019re doing it.\u201d\n\nNo one left behind\u00a0a\u00a0ledger sheet\u00a0tallying the precise\u00a0number of Jews  \u201cexterminated\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean the figure\u00a0can\u2019t be accurately [estimated](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10008193)\u00a0based  on existing evidence such as census reports and other government  records that survived Nazi efforts to destroy them at the end of the  war:\n\n&gt;No personnel were available or inclined to count Jewish  deaths until the very end of World War II and the Nazi regime. Hence,  total estimates are calculated only after the end of the war and are  based on demographic loss data and the documents of the perpetrators.  Though fragmentary, these sources provide essential figures from which  to make calculations.\u00a0\n\n## Rooted in anti-Semitism\n\nSome Holocaust deniers are self\\-styled\u00a0\u201chistorical revisionists\u201d \u2014  meaning they present themselves as earnest re\\-interpreters of real  historical data whose goal is simply to reveal the whole truth\u00a0\u2014 but  it\u2019s a misnomer.\u00a0Scratch the surface of your typical Holocaust denier  and you will find an anti\\-Semite. The notion, widespread among deniers,  that Jews \u201cinvented\u201d or \u201cexaggerated\u201d the Holocaust to further their own  interests\u00a0hearkens back to a centuries\\-old conspiracy theory\u00a0[positing](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007058) a secret \u201ccabal\u201d of wealthy Jewish bankers seeking absolute\u00a0world domination.\n\n\u201cThe Holocaust is the device used as the pillar of Zionist  imperialism, Zionist aggression, Zionist terror and Zionist murder,\u201d  former Ku Klux Klan Imperial Wizard David Duke has [said](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/12/13/kkk-david-duke-tells-iran-holocaust-conference-that-gas-chambers-not-used-to.html)\u00a0\\(while dismissing the claim that the Nazis used gas chambers to kill Jews as a \u201cmyth\u201d\\).\n\nIn 2013, England\u2019s most infamous Holocaust denier, David Irving  \\(quoted above saying more people died in Ted Kennedy\u2019s car than at  Auschwitz\\), was asked if it weren\u2019t true that Jews \u201crun the world\u201d:\n\n&gt;Irving, who strongly denies being anti\\-semitic, replies: \u201cWell sometimes people stand up and fight back.\u201d He says Jews in America control all media, banks and that \u201cthey dare  not appoint any leading person in the White House to ministerial  positions involving money without him being a Jew. Look where that got  them in Germany in 1933. And they will not learn the lesson, they all  think it won\u2019t happen again. \u201cThen they ask why they are so hated.\u201d \u2026 Irving says he hears people say Jews are hated because they crucified  Jesus Christ. \u201cI say if you walk into a pub in Wapping and ask people  why they don\u2019t like the Jews they don\u2019t mention Jesus. They mention  other reasons. They\u2019re worried about their mortgages and the banks \u2026  that\u2019s the reason why the Jews get hated.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s telling that Irving denies hating Jews while repeatedly observing\u00a0that \u201cJews are hated,\u201d then blames them for it.\n\n## The rise of \u201csoft denialism\u201d\n\nThere is a relatively new form of Holocaust denialism \u2014\u00a0dubbed \u201c[soft denialism](http://www.thetower.org/article/the-rise-of-soft-holocaust-denial/)\u201d  because its adherents don\u2019t deny the Holocaust outright but attempt to  trivialize it instead \u2014\u00a0whose rise seems to have followed\u00a0the same curve  as that\u00a0of right\\-wing nationalist movements worldwide in recent years.\n\nThe most prevalent\u00a0form of soft denialism revolves around the claim\u00a0that the\u00a0persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany is given preferential  treatment over\u00a0the persecution of other minority groups\u00a0by the same  regime. But this is a moral deflection. It\u2019s a fact\u00a0that the Reich  persecuted and killed [millions](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10008193)  of others in the name of \u201cAryan superiority\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Roma \\(\u201cgypsies\u201d\\), Serbs,  Poles, individuals\u00a0with disabilities, individuals\u00a0perceived as  \u201chomosexual,\u201d socialists, communists, and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, to name  only some of the targeted minorities \u2014\u00a0but this is no justification for  eliding Hitler\u2019s\u00a0decades\\-long [vendetta](http://www.aish.com/ho/i/Was_the_Holocaust_Only_Against_Jews.html) against the Jewish people in particular, a vendetta which very nearly ended in their complete eradication.\u00a0\n\nIn January 2017, President Trump was roundly criticized for issuing a [statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/statement-president-international-holocaust-remembrance-day)  \u201cin the name of the perished\u201d on Holocaust Remembrance Day, held on the  anniversary of\u00a0the 1945 liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp,  that never once mentioned the Jewish victims of that tragedy:\n\n&gt;January 27, 2017 Statement by the President on International Holocaust Remembrance Day \u201cIt is with a heavy heart and somber mind that we remember and honor  the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust. It is impossible to  fully fathom the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by  Nazi terror. \u201cYet, we know that in the darkest hours of humanity, light shines the  brightest.\u200e As we remember those who died, we are deeply grateful to  those who risked their lives to save the innocent. \u201cIn the name of the perished, I pledge to do everything in my power  throughout my Presidency, and my life, to ensure that the forces of evil  never again defeat the powers of good. Together, we will make love and  tolerance prevalent throughout the world.\u201d\n\nHarsh reactions to Trump\u2019s statement came from many quarters.\n\n\u201cThis is not a political issue, this is a matter of not just  sensitivity, it\u2019s a matter of historical fact,\u201d said Jonathan Greenblatt  of the Anti\\-Defamation League. \u201cSix million Jews were slaughtered along  with millions of other people. But the Holocaust was about this  singular focus on the annihilation of the Jewish people. That\u2019s why we  remember it. That\u2019s why there is a day, a sad day like this past Friday,  to reflect upon it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nazis killed an astonishing number of people in monstrous ways  and targeted certain groups \u2014 Gypsies, the mentally challenged, and open  homosexuals, among others,\u201d wrote conservative commentator John  Podhoretz. \u201cBut the Final Solution was aimed solely at\u00a0the Jews. The  Holocaust was about\u00a0the Jews. \u2026\u00a0To universalize it to \u2018all those who  suffered\u2019 is to scrub the Holocaust of its meaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lack of a direct statement about the suffering of the Jewish  people during the Holocaust was an unfortunate omission,\u201d said Fred  Brown, a spokesperson for the Republican Jewish Coalition. \u201cHistory  unambiguously shows the purpose of the Nazi\u2019s final solution was the  extermination of the Jews of Europe. We hope, going forward, he conveys  those feelings when speaking about the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nThe White House\u00a0dismissed the\u00a0criticisms, claiming they simply didn\u2019t  want to leave any of the victims out. \u201cDespite what the media reports,  we are an incredibly inclusive group and we took into account all of  those who suffered,\u201d said spokesperson Hope Hicks.\n\nIf the Trump administration won\u2019t listen to their critics, they ought  to\u00a0at least take note of who applauded them for their Holocaust  statement \u2014 the openly anti\\-Semitic \u201calt\\-right\u201d\u00a0leader\u00a0Richard Spencer,  for one, who hailed what he termed President Trump\u2019s \u201cde\\-Judification of  the Holocaust\u201d in a blog post titled \u201c[Because Hitler](http://altright.com/2017/01/29/because-hitler/).\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201c\\[T\\]he kvetching came quickly\u201d \\(yes, he used the Yiddish word\\) after  Trump\u2019s statement was released, noted Spencer, and he was having none of  it:\u00a0\n\n&gt;Trump\u2019s statement on Holocaust Memorial Day is, on the  surface, utterly defensible within the current moral paradigm: Hitler is  depicted as quintessential evil, with modern society revolving around  this dark center. But when viewed from the perspective of Jewish  activists, Trump\u2019s statement becomes outrageous, as it dethrones Jews  from a special position in the universe.\n\nIt seems unlikely\u00a0that \u201cdethroning Jews\u201d was precisely what the Trump  administration had in mind when they said their intent  was\u00a0\u201cinclusiveness.\u201d That President Trump\u2019s Holocaust statement elicited  such a response from\u00a0an avowed white supremacist ought to give him  pause before it comes time to issue the next one.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe following comment has been copied and pasted from Snopes.

{"archived": false, "author": "ipsum629", "body": "In my experience it usually isn't directed at non Jews in general. I can't believe I'm doing this but here are some concrete examples of when Jews are prejudiced against non Jews.\n\nGermans: some Jews will not buy things made in Germany, especially cars. The government of Israel has no problem buying German submarines, though\n\nHungarian: many Jews regard Hungarians during ww2 as more anti-Semitic than the Germans, and will not ever go to Hungary.\n\nFrench: Many Jews percieve the French as really anti semitic and avoid french people\n\nIberians: Many don't like the Iberians(Portuguese and Spanish) because of the Spanish Inquisition(the Portuguese also expelled the Jews)\n\nRussians: many Jews came from Russia or areas occupied by Russia/the Soviet Union. Many Jews don't like Russia for this.\n\nArabs: Arab Israeli war makes Jews weary of Arabs, but cultural and ethnic ties make Jews hopeful of a resolution of differences\n\nIranians: similar to Arabs, but it's mainly against the government of Iran. Jews celebrate Purim which really boils down to \"thank Iran for not letting that guy kill us all that one time\"\n\nAfricans/African Americans: surprisingly common to be classically racist. No justification. Just humans(us) being stupid. WW2 really improved the relationship between Jews and African Americans because it gave American Jews a much greater sense that they were persecuted, and paved the way for Jews to be allies of the civil Rights movement. Even before then, Jews tended to serve African Americans on more equal terms than the WASPs, but by no means we're we always perfect in this regard, and Jews, like everyone else, need to improve. Jews also tend to be very insular and there can be some culture shock when the perfect little JAPs see an African American for the first time. There is also some issues within the Jewish community in Israel with accommodating the Ethiopian Jews. Not as well informed there.\n\nSoutherners: Jews tend to have a mentality of \"if they are racist towards so-and-so they probably won't like us\". So if one part of a society is generalized as being racist, many Jews won't go near it. This is a big reason the largest communities of Jews resided in the north.\n\nThere are certain non Jew peoples that Jews often regard as particularly noble.\n\nNordics: saving Jews during the holocaust and having virtually no history of antisemitism has really endeared Nordic nationalities to the Jews\n\nCanadians/Americans: the massive Jewish populations of these two places as well as the culture of religious freedom, and some early letters from George Washington himself guaranteeing the safety of Jews has made North Americans in general the \"good guys\" to Jews.\n\nDutch: they made a valiant effort to save the Jews of WW2, and the diary of Anne Frank has made Dutch-Jewish relations start at a point of shared experience.\n\nBalts: Vilnius was called the \"Jerusalem of the north\" and the area tends to be less serious about religion, which tends to be a good environment for Jews\n\nMost Asians(Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, Filipinos): virtually non-existent history of antisemitism. Japan helped save Jews in WW2. China and Korea have a shared experience of persecution with Jews. China was one of the first nations to recognize the State of Israel. Jews and Asians share a lot of values(family, education) and thus regard each other as successful and worthy of emulation. Asian Americans and Jewish Americans shared a lot of space and birthed a tradition of kosher Chinese food.

You complain about supply line bombing (which killed e.g, 70,000 French civilians - there's a fact to store in your anti-Anglo archive) but bombing was about all the Brits could do.\n\n&gt; If you yourself admitted the Anglo-Americans didn't know about mass genocide, why does it follow their imperialism was justified? \n\nThe Anglos unleashed modernity. Any larping about debasement is inane\n\n&gt; are you claiming it wasn't a longstanding policy by the British to sabotage a continental European alliance at every step and at every cost?\n\nYes. German unification was welcomed as a countervailing force to France and Russia.\n\n&gt; I know your source for such a claim is coming from the Soviets themselves\n\nThe source comes from the 'Polish Fortnightly Review', independently corroborated by several (non-Soviet) witnesses (during and post-war). \n\nAnd, btw, witness discrepancy would negate the idea that there was any overarching 'Anglo-Jewish conspiracy'. Individual testimony is notoriously unreliable; in the collective it's not.\n\n&gt; Because they've always been the core European subgroup. \n\nTalent is not enough. You're only 'the best' if you prove it. Get back to me when billions speak German. It must gall you to speak the language of a people you despise. \n\n&gt; Germans have always been the bulwark of Europe. \n\nEvidenced by some 20th century proxy war? Lol, okay.\n\nIt was the French who thwarted the Islamic hordes at Tours - something Hitler [lamented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_of_Adolf_Hitler#Hitler_on_Islam). And it was the Italian-Spanish who smashed the Ottomans at Lepanto. \n\nAlso, it was the Poles who [rebuffed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War) expansionist Leninism circa 1920. It was the Poles who were the antisemitic, antisocialist bulwark of Europe for 2 decades. And what did the 'Germans' do in response? That's right, savagely betray them in conjunction with Marxists. \n\nAnd who was it that transported Lenin through Europe, thereby unleasing Bolshevism (inspired by 'German War Socialism') on the world? Yes, that's right, the Germans (specificially the Prussian General Ludendorff). It was Churchill who wanted to crush the Soviets post-WWI. \n\nThere was actually a covert German-Soviet military alliance ('ganster fraternization') in the aftermath of the WWI. The irony is that the Germans taught the Soviets how to build superior tanks, tanks which overwhelmed the Nazis in WWII (the mass produced T-34 was superior to any hulking behemoth the nazis 'hand-crafted').\n\n&gt; That's certainly Buchanan's thesis, but the numbers were still not threatening and I more blame the English for not taking the Kaiser's offer for an Anglo-German brotherhood. \n\nFrom what I've read the triple entente that isolated Germany came about through weak diplomacy and bad luck. The Germans, pursuing their 'self-sufficient' weltpolitik, rebuffed Russia, France, and Britian at various junctures, made some diplomatic blunders, and generally did nothing as the entente coalesced (1907) for reasons other than anti-Germanism (mostly Britain-Russian antagonism which led to British-French rapprochement). One can make a moderate case that Germany's isolation generated the anti-Germanism, rather than anti-Germanism generating the isolation (though France would be perennially bitter about Alsace-Lorraine). \n\nThat would be the seed of a nuanced understanding of the origins, as opposed to this asinie 'ra ra evil Brits murdered 2 million innocent Germans on a whim for credit' mantra you're spewing. Antagonism alone is not enough for a bloodbath. WWI is the most studied diplomatic event in history for a reason. If anyone 'engineered' WWI, it wasn't Britain (why do the French always get off the hook? it's like in your world they don't exist. It wasn't the Brits who ran roughshod over disunited, early 19th century Germania).\n\n&gt; German industrial production\n\nLeeches on the industrialism the Brits created.

You can do the same shit to deny the moon landing. It doesn't dignify a [response](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/how-to-refute-holocaust-denial).\n\nI never claimed that Jews were definitely, 100% gassed in their millions. I would put the figure at 90-95%. \n\n&gt; The Germans were just masterfully secretive\n\nWelp.. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresienstadt_(film)\n\nFrom the Himmler speech you ignored: \"We can now very openly talk about this among ourselves, and yet we will never discuss this publicly. Just as we did not hesitate on 30 June 1934, to perform our duty as ordered and put comrades who had failed up against the wall and execute them, we also never spoke about it, nor will we ever speak about it. Let us thank God that we had within us enough self-evident fortitude never to discuss it among us, and we never talked about it. Every one of us was horrified, and yet every one clearly understood that we would do it next time, when the order is given and when it becomes necessary.\n\nI am talking about the \"Jewish evacuation\": the extermination of the Jewish people. It is one of those things that is easily said. \"The Jewish people is being exterminated,\" every Party member will tell you, \"perfectly clear, it's part of our plans, we're eliminating the Jews, exterminating them, ha!, a small matter.\" And then they turn up, the upstanding 80 million Germans, and each one has his decent Jew. They say the others are all swines, but this particular one is a splendid Jew.

{"archived": false, "author": "falsescorpion", "body": "There's a lot going on with Judaism, Jews, and Israel (three separate concepts, although there are some topics on which they converge). Bear with me on this.\n\n1) **The state of Israel** is largely secular, \"ethnic\" Jewish rather than spiritually Jewish.\n\n2) But the state of Israel harbours **the Jewish theocracy.** The theocracy is (predictably) obsessed with the prophets of the Old Testament/Torah, because Judaism still awaits the Messiah Emmanuel.\n\n3a) The theocracy stirs up panic and paranoia among **the diaspora Jews** scattered throughout the world, because the theocracy wants them to emigrate to Israel. The Jewish people being assembled in their ancestral homeland is a key part of Jewish eschatology (\"end-of-the-world-ology\").\n\n3b) The state of Israel likes to keep **Israeli Jews** on a war footing, because of the state of Israel's creeping occupation of surrounding territory. Palestine is the most obvious example of this gradual annexation.\n\nSo, there's a conceptual overlap between the state of Israel and the Jewish theocracy to which it is home. Your average Jew is caught in the middle of this war-and-persecution war (literal war and a war in terms of non-stop quick-fire propaganda too).\n\nBut at the most mundane level, most Jews don't conspire so much as help each other out. Is it really a conspiracy if a Jew chooses to shop with a Jewish shopkeeper, hires a Jewish accountant, and hires a Jewish window-cleaner? Most other ethnicities behave in analogous ways. But Jews, culturally, are very very good at this, which is precisely how diaspora Jews have survived centuries of persecution. If you like, \"clannish\" behaviour has been \"naturally selected\" (n.b., this is a metaphor, there is no genetic basis for this tendency to stick close to each other AFAIK).\n\nThat's about as simple as I can get it. Three separate entities, which occasionally have coinciding interests, the third of which (disapora Jewishness) isn't really a coherent entity at all and gets jostled about relentlessly by the others.\n\nIt's fascinatingly complex, and once you perceive the three layers at work the whole enigma starts to make a bit more sense.

Just because you haven't read anything regarding it doesn't mean it fails to exist. Nazism isn't a term and modern history doesn't reflect current events or your information sources alleging widespread antisemitism in the west by Christians. Only widespread antisemitism in the west currently is in Europe coming from muslim migrants from the middle east. However Jew's getting shit on in the West over a milienia is well recorded. Christian distrust and persecution of Jews for killing Christ is the starting point.  Jews weren't allowed to own land in most of Europe so many became tradesmen instead of farmers and drew ire from those in lower economic conditions. They also played a large role in medieval banking because the Catholic Church made it a sin and illegal in areas for a Christian to lend money with interest to another Christian. Profiting off the need of a fellow Christian in hard times was a sin was the reasoning. Persecution was why in the 10 or 11th century roughly the King of Poland issued a decree encouraging jews to move there and giving them rights and protection. It was more due to Poland needing exports and a taxbase to compete with other powers than it was a charitable act some claim others say it wasn't.  Move along to 1400s Ferdinand and Isabella the Spanish king and queen who funded Columbus in 1492 sailing the ocean blue and also were behind the Spanish Inquisition. Before them large parts of Spain were controlled by muslims from north africa. After they regained control being good catholics they went about torturing and killing any protestants and jews who didnt convert. Documentation of Jewish men hanging weights on the penises attempting to stretch foreskins back a uncircumcised appearance because before recently only jews practiced circumcision. That's just a few examples of an \"inadequately explored\" history that I recall off the top of my head. Knowledge gained from reading nonfiction history over the years and textbooks in history classes. The holocaust resulted from antisemitism in the past, a book called the protocols of the Elders of Zion in the late 1800s, delusions of a mad man (Adolf), and the need for a scapegoat by a figure attempting to gain power for the masses. Something or someone they could literally reach out and touch. Plus don't forget that the Russian Revoltion was the result of Jewish revolutionaries. Lenin and Trotsky were both Jews as many other of the early soviet regime. Stalin was Georgian by main consensus.

Seems like it would put a damper on their whole \"we are the superior race\" thing.\n\n&gt;Yet Peterson rarely speaks about anti-Semitism itself, even though he says he\u2019s been obsessed with the Holocaust since he was a teenager and lectures on it frequently.\n\nAnyone who's actually listened to him talk about the subject knows that's because he's against that kind of violence *regardless* of the reason it's committed, and his emphasis is on understanding how people can end up accepting such violence and dehumanization in general.\n\n&gt;If Peterson were to be more forthcoming about the importance of anti-Semitism in the Holocaust, it \u201cmight allow some of his viewers to think about course correcting,\u201d Holt added.\n\nDoes anybody *not* know the Nazi's hated Jews? Like, I'm pretty sure that everybody already knows the Nazi's hated the Jews specifically. There's no damn reason to say \"the Nazi's were racist against Jews\" every damn time they're mentioned. Everyone knows that already. That's why the primary victims were Jews, and not just a bunch of random people with no affiliation with each other.\n\n&gt;Yet behind the father figure role he affects lie darker preoccupations with Hitler, Marxists and the \u201cradical left\u201d on college campuses. That\u2019s where his teachings can provide fodder for conspiracy theorists and bigots.\n\nHey look, an article making bold claims and giving no examples at all. It's almost like the writer is pushing an agenda, instead of attempting to cover a topic honestly.\n\n&gt;\u201cYou can assume that they [Jews] are intelligent and have a culture of learning, or you can think that there\u2019s some kind of cabal,\u201d Peterson told the Forward. \u201cSo if I\u2019m gonna hit the hornets nest, I might as well hit it on the side that takes the wind out of the sails of far-righters and their idiot anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\nFuckin' case closed. Dude is opposed to Nazi's and thinks they're idiots.\n\n&gt;Peterson\u2019s willingness to answer questions about \u201cJewish success\u201d and his interest in IQ literature is \u201csuspicious\u201d said Deborah Lipstadt\n\nYou heard it here first, trying to debunk conspiracy theories somehow means that you think those conspiracy theories are true.\n\n&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s not [Holocaust] denial, but when people start asking questions like that, I begin to get leery,\u201d Lipstadt said.\n\nOnce again, certain ideas are not even allowed to be *discussed* by the modern left.  \nLike, Lipstadt's position here is only going to reinforce the neo-nazi's, since they seem to love that old \"who are you not allowed to criticize\" quote, and this just gives them even more ammunition for that.\n\n&gt;\u201cAnyone who really diminishes the importance of anti-Semitism \u2014 who says, \u2018Oh it was an afterthought, a cover\u2019 \u2014 I think has got it wrong,\u201d she said.\n\n&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t see how you can distinguish cause and effect when discussing the relationship between anti-semitism [sic] and the Holocaust because they are different element [sic] of the same thing. The question is \u2018what is driving both?\u2019\u201d Peterson told the Forward in an email.\n\nThe article literally just refuted itself. Peterson *doesn't* say that anti-semitism was an afterthought or a cover.  \nAnd like, how could anti-semitism even be a *cover* for the holocaust? What would that even mean? That sentence makes no sense.\n\n&gt;Peterson thinks that peer pressure is nearly always stronger than one\u2019s inner moral compass. Anyone has it within them to be Hitler if given enough power, he claims.\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;He also believes almost anyone would have become a Nazi if they were a German living under Hitler \u2014 that \u201ceveryone participated\u201d in the Holocaust.\n\n&gt;\u201cHis audience is without a doubt a large chunk of people in the \u2018alt-right,\u2019 and that\u2019s the kind of signaling that would appeal to them,\u201d said Heidi Beirich\n\nWhat \"signaling\"? He's warning *against* the moral complacency that lead to the holocaust, for fuck's sake! It didn't just randomly happen overnight, things built up to it, and everyone who didn't stand up against the smaller abuses allowed the abuses to grow ever larger.\n\n&gt;Peterson admits he has a dim view of human nature. But he has a much rosier picture of humanity\u2019s potential to learn from its mistakes...  \nhe says, the reason genocides continue to happen is that Holocaust education is not good enough. People don\u2019t understand that it was a feature, not a bug, of human behavior.\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;Holocaust education is not a silver bullet, according to Sander Gilman...  \n\u201cIf you have a fantasy that that is going to be a kind of vaccination against hate, that\u2019s wonderfully na\u00efve,\u201d Gilman said. \u201cThe rise of anti-Semitism today has to do with situations today.\u201d\n\nSituations of today like the continuing propensity of humans to use \"us vs. them\" logic, and to dehumanize the outgroup? Because those haven't changed a damn bit since WWII, and are just as powerful and hard to resist as they ever have been.  \nAs for why some people continue to attribute many of the world's problems to Jews, that's because the Nazi's and their sympathizers already did a heck of a lot of propaganda work on that, and so it's easier for people to hate on Jews than to start from scratch and come up with some new group to hate.", "score": 202, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "date_year_month": "2018-05", "created_utc_converted": "2018-05-12 11:50:34", "score_overall": 16, "words": "jew jewish jewish holocaust holocaust conspiracy jewish conspiracy conspiracy holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust", "shared_words": "jew jewish holocaust conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

Peterson is on a 50-city tour of North America and Europe to promote his best-selling new book, \u201c12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos.\u201d His YouTube channel has over a million subscribers. He has answered questions about global Jewish influence several times, in person and online. In an April blog post, he attributed that alleged influence to Jewish intelligence \u2014an old anti-Semitic dog whistle.\n\nYet Peterson rarely speaks about anti-Semitism itself, even though he says he\u2019s been obsessed with the Holocaust since he was a teenager and lectures on it frequently.

If Peterson were to be more forthcoming about the importance of anti-Semitism in the Holocaust, it \u201cmight allow some of his viewers to think about course correcting,\u201d Holt added.\n\nPeterson, 55, used to be an ordinary academic at the University of Toronto. His first and only other book, published in 1999, was a 600-page tome chiefly about Jungian psychology. He taught at Harvard in the 1980s before moving to Toronto; back then, his \u201caudience\u201d was his students. Now, he posts lectures on everything from Palestine to parenting, the Book of Genesis to psychobiology, on YouTube. Supporters gave him $70,000 through the website Patreon in April 2017, compared with $700 in April 2016. \u201c12 Rules For Life\u201d has sold over 700,000 copies since its publication in January, the Washington Post reported.\n\nPeterson didn\u2019t reach these heights because of his discourses on Jewish topics. His primary preoccupation is healing broken masculinity, and his main following is the young men with whom such a\u00a0focus resonates.\u00a0Peterson is nowhere near as toxic as various other internet cultures, like the \u201cincels\u201d who blame women \u2014 and sometimes murder them \u2014 because they\u2019re not having sex. Yet behind the father figure role he affects lie darker preoccupations with Hitler, Marxists and the \u201cradical left\u201d on college campuses. That\u2019s where his teachings can provide fodder for conspiracy theorists and bigots.\n\nNo, \u2018Dark Web Intellectuals\u2019 Like Sam Harris And Jordan Peterson Are Not Being SilencedNoah BerlatskyMay 8, 2018\n\nPeterson opposes Jew hatred, he says, and claims that leftist members of the media tried to hurt him by linking him to white supremacists. He has accused white supremacists of having a\u00a0\u201cpathology of racial pride,\u201d\u00a0and written that \u201cidentity politics\u201d \u2013- the idea that drives white nationalism \u2014 is \u201cmisguided.\u201d\n\nPeterson told the Forward he felt he had to answer the question of Jewish influence in order to undermine the far right\u2019s anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. Other scholars don\u2019t think that\u2019s a sound strategy.\n\nHe has addressed the subject several times in public and online, most recently in a\u00a0blog post\u00a0published on his website, when he talked about Jewish IQ. It\u2019s higher than average, he said, and that\u2019s true also for people in power. Therefore Jews are accurately represented among the cultural and financial elite of the world. Peterson didn\u2019t mention anti-Semitism directly in this lecture, but he was thinking about it, he said.\n\n\u201cYou can assume that they [Jews] are intelligent and have a culture of learning, or you can think that there\u2019s some kind of cabal,\u201d Peterson told the Forward. \u201cSo if I\u2019m gonna hit the hornets nest, I might as well hit it on the side that takes the wind out of the sails of far-righters and their idiot anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\nPeterson\u2019s willingness to answer questions about\u00a0\u201cJewish success\u201d\u00a0and his interest in IQ literature is \u201csuspicious\u201d said Deborah Lipstadt, a professor of history at Emory University and author of \u201cDenying the Holocaust,\u201d who won a libel case in Britain against prominent Holocaust denier David Irving.\n\nLipstadt said that Peterson\u2019s statements on Jewish intelligence reminded her of Kevin MacDonald, a professor of psychology who the Southern Poverty Law Center has\u00a0described\u00a0as \u201cthe neo-Nazi movement\u2019s favorite academic.\u201d MacDonald has written several books criticizing Jewish intellectual culture. (Peterson links to a critique of one of MacDonald\u2019s books at the end of his blog post on Jewish intelligence.) Lipstadt said that MacDonald\u2019s academic language obscures the anti-Semitism behind his opinions. She worries the same is true of Peterson.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not [Holocaust] denial, but when people start asking questions like that, I begin to get leery,\u201d Lipstadt said. \u201cThe question is, is he a self-help guru who find the Holocaust a convenient way of attracting attention, or is there serious thought going on here?\u201d\n\nLikewise, Lipstadt wonders why Peterson rarely mentions anti-Semitism in his work on the Holocaust.

Why don't you just say he's a secret Nazi? \n\nAnd let's just put this out there now: Anything can be fodder for conspiracy theorists and bigots. It's a virtually meaningless statement. Peterson is clear on what he thinks of the alt-right and neo-Nazis. \n\n&gt;Peterson opposes Jew hatred, he says, and claims that leftist members of the media tried to hurt him by linking him to white supremacists. He has accused white supremacists of having a \u201cpathology of racial pride,\u201d and written that \u201cidentity politics\u201d \u2013- the idea that drives white nationalism \u2014 is \u201cmisguided.\u201d\n\nCase closed.\n\n&gt;Peterson told the Forward he felt he had to answer the question of Jewish influence in order to undermine the far right\u2019s anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.

You're completely undermining his explanation with weasel language. \n\n&gt;Peterson\u2019s willingness to answer questions about \u201cJewish success\u201d and his interest in IQ literature is \u201csuspicious\u201d said Deborah Lipstadt, a professor of history at Emory University and author of \u201cDenying the Holocaust,\u201d who won a libel case in Britain against prominent Holocaust denier David Irving.\n\nMore weasel language. Instead of addressing what he says, we're going to make the false claim that merely discussing these matters makes him a secret bigot. Fuck off.\n\n&gt;Lipstadt said that Peterson\u2019s statements on Jewish intelligence reminded her of Kevin MacDonald, a professor of psychology who the Southern Poverty Law Center has described as \u201cthe neo-Nazi movement\u2019s favorite academic.\u201d MacDonald has written several books criticizing Jewish intellectual culture.

Lipstadt said that MacDonald\u2019s academic language obscures the anti-Semitism behind his opinions. She worries the same is true of Peterson.\n\nAh, more guilt-by-assocation, this time by the radical leftist SPLC. Even less reason to take this article seriously. I've done a quick look-up of this guy, and it appears that the only thing linking him to Peterson is that they have both discussed Jews. MacDonald seems to think there's a Jewish conspriacy (at least according to some quotes I've seen) but Peterson has said the opposite -- even says the opposite in this article! \n\nMy guess is that this professor has never watched anything Peterson has done, and is going on second-hand information. \n\n&gt;Likewise, Lipstadt wonders why Peterson rarely mentions anti-Semitism in his work on the Holocaust. Peterson more often attributes the cause of the Holocaust to human nature.\n\u201cAnyone who really diminishes the importance of anti-Semitism \u2014 who says, \u2018Oh it was an afterthought, a cover\u2019 \u2014 I think has got it wrong,\u201d she said.\n\nAnti-Semitism isn't some alien microbe infecting our brains. It's a symptom of a larger problem, one that is fundamental to our psychology. One of the most fanciful (and futile) beliefs shared by SJWs is that they can \"eliminate\" hatred in society -- or,  at least eliminate the kind of hate they disagree with. They're some of the most hateful people in the world, so obviously it's not hate *as a concept* they disapprove of. Anyway. My point is that they act like they can completely eradicate this thing that exists within everyone, but they can't. The most they can do is neutralize it, but even that's only ever going to be a temporary and very specific thing. You can take anti-Semitism out of your legislation, for example. But you can't take it out of your culture. Not completely. And you certainly can't take it out of your biology. \n\n&gt;His audience is without a doubt a large chunk of people in the \u2018alt-right,\u2019 and that\u2019s the kind of signaling that would appeal to them,\u201d said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center. \u201cIf you play fast and loose with the issue, you\u2019re going to be seen as a possible ally in Holocaust denial.\u201d\n\nFast and loose *how?* Where has he done this? And the SPLC sees \"allies\" to bigotry literally everywhere, so why are we quoting them here? And given Peterson's actual position on the matter, who gives a shit who thinks they are his ally? How does it tangibly help a neo-Nazi to claim Jordan Peterson as his own when Peterson expressly denounces all forms of identity politics? \n\n&gt; If you have a fantasy that that is going to be a kind of vaccination against hate, that\u2019s wonderfully na\u00efve,\u201d Gilman said. \u201cThe rise of anti-Semitism today has to do with situations today.\u201d\n\nSo Peterson explains that it's the lack of education about the Holocaust that is responsible for the rise in modern anti-Semitism, and this dumb cunt says that's not true because *reasons*. Great. Can someone explain why this person was quoted and what, exactly, they brought to the conversation? Because, to me, that looks like another way of saying \"Nuh uh.\" \n\n&gt;Peterson has repeatedly said that instead of being suspicious of Jews, the world should be grateful that there are so many Jewish geniuses.\n\n&gt;\u201cThey\u2019re a resource you don\u2019t want to squander,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd you've still managed to write this article blaming him for anti-Semitism.

There was a faction within NSDAP that believed in the 'socialist' part of the 'workers' party, and they believed that Hitler would confiscate the junker estates, institute good salaries for workers and so on...but these things were never intended to happen by the leadership of the NSDAP, instead they worked with the factory owners, capitalist and industrialists and actually DECREASED wages for the common worker and killed off the unions. \n\n\nI quote from Wikipedias article about 'Mein Kampf'\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mein_Kampf)\n***\nAnalysis: \nIn Mein Kampf, Hitler used the main thesis of \"the Jewish peril\", which posits a Jewish conspiracy to gain world leadership.[7] The narrative describes the process by which he became increasingly antisemitic and militaristic, especially during his years in Vienna. He speaks of not having met a Jew until he arrived in Vienna, and that at first his attitude was liberal and tolerant. When he first encountered the antisemitic press, he says, he dismissed it as unworthy of serious consideration. Later he accepted the same antisemitic views, which became crucial to his program of national reconstruction of Germany.\n\nMein Kampf has also been studied as a work on political theory. For example, Hitler announces his hatred of what he believed to be the world's two evils: Communism and Judaism.\n\nIn the book Hitler blamed Germany's chief woes on the parliament of the Weimar Republic, the Jews, and Social Democrats, as well as Marxists, though he believed that Marxists, Social Democrats, and the parliament were all working for Jewish interests.[8] He announced that he wanted to completely destroy the parliamentary system, believing it to be corrupt in principle, as those who reach power are inherent opportunists.\n*** \n***\nAntisemitism: \nWhile historians dispute the exact date Hitler decided to force the Jewish people to emigrate to Madagascar, few place the decision before the mid-1930s.[9] First published in 1925, Mein Kampf shows Hitler's personal grievances and his ambitions for creating a New Order.\n\nThe historian Ian Kershaw points out that several passages in Mein Kampf are undeniably of a genocidal nature.[10] Hitler wrote \"the nationalization of our masses will succeed only when, aside from all the positive struggle for the soul of our people, their international poisoners are exterminated\",[11] and he suggested that, \"If at the beginning of the war and during the war twelve or fifteen thousand of these Hebrew corrupters of the nation had been subjected to poison gas, such as had to be endured in the field by hundreds of thousands of our very best German workers of all classes and professions, then the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain.\"[12]\n\nThe racial laws to which Hitler referred resonate directly with his ideas in Mein Kampf. In the first edition of Mein Kampf, Hitler stated that the destruction of the weak and sick is far more humane than their protection. Apart from this allusion to humane treatment, Hitler saw a purpose in destroying \"the weak\" in order to provide the proper space and purity for the \"strong\".[13]\n***\n\n***\nLebensraum: \nWhile historians dispute the exact date Hitler decided to force the Jewish people to emigrate to Madagascar, few place the decision before the mid-1930s.[9] First published in 1925, Mein Kampf shows Hitler's personal grievances and his ambitions for creating a New Order.\n\nThe historian Ian Kershaw points out that several passages in Mein Kampf are undeniably of a genocidal nature.[10] Hitler wrote \"the nationalization of our masses will succeed only when, aside from all the positive struggle for the soul of our people, their international poisoners are exterminated\",[11] and he suggested that, \"If at the beginning of the war and during the war twelve or fifteen thousand of these Hebrew corrupters of the nation had been subjected to poison gas, such as had to be endured in the field by hundreds of thousands of our very best German workers of all classes and professions, then the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain.\"[12]\n\nThe racial laws to which Hitler referred resonate directly with his ideas in Mein Kampf.

{"archived": false, "author": "ExtraSwimming", "body": "1\\) The idea of a \"plan\" or \"classified documents\" is obviously silly. \"White Genocide\" isn't a literal conspiracy. What is often caricatured as \"conspiracy\" is simply an observation of group interests and individuals, including individuals in power, acting in accordance with their identified group interests. For example, a Jewish person won't call up their Rabbi and ask for advice. They'll simply ask themselves, \"is this policy in my interest *as a Jew*?\".\n\nSimilarly, we don't need to think there's a Mexican conspiracy to take over the US Southwest in order to observe that the American southwest is in fact being settled by Mexicans, many of whom mainly speak Spanish and have fundamentally Mexican, not American, political and social attitudes.\n\n2\\) White genocide may differ in method from previous genocides but not in result. And it is truly a *White* genocide. The world is about 90&amp;#37; non\\-white; \"diversity\" is encouraged only in white countries, and there are few white countries in which it is not encouraged \\(Eastern Europe being the exception\\). Nobody is advocating that Ethiopia has to have greater \"diversity\" i.e. fewer black Ethiopians, or that Japan needs more \"diversity\" i.e. fewer Japanese. \"Diversity\" as understood here is an American / western\\-European concept and value that many cultures view as a naive, self\\-hating, suicidal tendency.\n\n3\\) Yes, the leaders are aware of this. It is seen as inevitable and necessary. The high cost of living and cultural attitudes lead to low native fertility and shrinking population in the rich western world. For cultural as well as economic reasons, non\\-white fertility exceeds native averages. Poor parents have nothing to lose \\(and often welfare to gain\\) by having many children. \\(Typically whiter\\) middle\\-class and upper\\-class families have only as many children as they can afford at their accustomed standard of living.\n\nCapitalist elites as well as governments, meanwhile, are premised on and benefit from population growth to keep the \"machine\" running. This is fundamental to the nature of interest\\-bearing debt finance as well as redistributive programs, medicare, and pensions, which require a growing workforce to support the nonworking population. The aging baby boom and increased life expectancy upsets the \"demographic pyramid\" required for these systems to work.\n\nSince native population growth is negative, our leaders are importing an expanding workforce and population base. \"Diversity\" is a necessary consequence of this.\n\nCapitalists, specifically, want cheap labor \u2013\u00a0illegal aliens are cheap construction and agricultural workers, among other roles, and they increase labor supply, reducing labor's bargaining power and thus suppressing wages. This increases return on capital.\n\nThis also highlights divergent motivations for \"white genocide\". For the capitalist elite *as capitalists*, it is simply an inevitable and necessary side\\-effect of the need to increase productive population. For the Jews specifically \\(who disproportionately make up that capitalist elite\\), it is also a means of preventing another holocaust by diluting and dividing the native populations they live among.\n\n[Jewish President of France, Nicholas Sarkozy, says it out loud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8yaiN6ew_g)\n\n4\\) The mechanics of this can be easily understood by the following:\n\n[YT clip \u2013\u00a0Antiracist Hitler \\(White Rabbit Radio\\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKDeyuM0-Og)\n\nStephen Steinlight, a former Director of National Affairs \\(i.e. domestic policy\\) at the[ American Jewish Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jewish_Committee), the \"dean of American Jewish organizations,\" fully explains from a Jewish perspective in a short paper:\n\n[Steinlight: \"The Jewish Stake in America's Changing Demography\" \\(2001\\)](https://cis.org/Jewish-Stake-Americas-Changing-Demography).\n\n[YT \u2013 FrameGame discusses Steinlight's paper \\(watchable at 2x\\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkaHe2ncUtU)\n\n[YT \u2013 How the Whites took over America \\(White Rabbit Radio\\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faNge-o0V-k)\n\n5\\) While the motivation matters less than the material reality of white genocide, it's clear that there is some significant anti\\-white racial animus in the radical left and in the coalition that promotes white genocide policies.\n\n[YT \u2013\u00a0FrameGame on \"Love means Hating the Right People\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ55j0QRbVc)", "score": 10, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "DebateAltRight", "date_year_month": "2018-05", "created_utc_converted": "2018-05-14 21:06:13", "score_overall": 12, "words": "conspiracy conspiracy jewish jew conspiracy holocaust jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish", "shared_words": "conspiracy jewish jew holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}

{"archived": false, "author": "CertifiedRabbi", "body": "I read it all and looked into Cofnas's background. \n\nBasically, Cofnas is an Alt-Right(ish) Jew who seems to be attracted to Jared Taylor's American Renaissance wing of the Alt-Right/White nationalist community. He seems to be loyal to both the White race/Western civilization *and* his fellow Jews and Israel. He also largely agrees with our views on hereditarianism/race realism/scientific racism/eugenics. And he liked that Jared Taylor's American Renaissance movement welcomes Jews like him and treats Jews as \"fellow men of the West\". \n\nIt was the anti-Jewish views of the Alt-Right and the larger White nationalist community which alienated him and motivated him to debunk Kevin MacDonald's work (which he completely failed at) because he saw that Kevin MacDonald's work played a central role in red-pilling the modern White nationalist community on the JQ. He's basically trying to remove the anti-Jewish racism from the White nationalist/Alt-Right community by debunking Kevin MacDonald's work.\n\nHe clearly views himself as being both White and Jewish. And he views Islam as the common enemy of both Whites and Jews. And he views White Western civilization as vital to maintaining Israel's security - hence his loyalty to the Western world. He also clearly looked very deeply into the taboo topic of scientific racism and found that the racists actually had the data on their side and were telling the truth. \n\nThere's two main paths that Jews can take when they're confronted with right-wing ideology and scientific racism. The vast majority of Jews in the West strongly oppose right-wing ideology and scientific racism because they think that it leads towards Nazism - which is an existential threat to Jews. But right-wing ideology and scientific racism also appeals to Jews because right-wingers are pro-Zionist, and because Ashkenazi Jews are basically the Aryan master race within modern scientific racism because they have the highest IQs. Scientific racism also justifies Jewish privilege and Jewish power in the world because it suggests that they're simply better than everybody else at the genetic level. In a meritocratic world, Jews naturally rise to the top because they're simply smarter than everybody else. And so scientific racism seemingly debunks anti-Jewish conspiracy theories about Jews conspiring with one another to achieve power and manipulate the goyim in order to advance their own ethnic interests at the expense of non-Jews (which is essentially what MacDonald's work revolves around). \n\nAnd it seems like Steven Pinker, who Cofnas clearly views as an intellectual mentor, and Cofnas developed a personal relationship and worked together to take down MacDonald's work (which, again, they completely failed at). I'm nearly 100% sure that Pinker is referring to Cofnas in [this](https://youtu.be/6xJ5bvw6Ckw) video. Pinker seems to be a closeted Jewish race realist as well, but he's a lot more cautious and hostile than Cofnas is when it comes to dealing with White nationalism and the right in general. Pinker knows the game that he has to play in order to maintain his credibility and popularity within the progressive echo chamber of modern Western academia. Pinker is mildly pushing Western academia in the direction of hereditarianism and race realism but in a way that's still marginally morally acceptable to Western shitlibs. Whereas Cofnas is much more red-pilled, edgy, brazen, and right-wing in his support for scientific racism because he's been heavily influenced by Jared Taylor's work and the Alt-Right community. \n\nCofnas seemed to like the intellectual honesty, scientific literacy, and Islamophobia of Jared Taylor's work and the Alt-Right, but what he didn't like was the resurgence of anti-Jewish racism within the White nationalist community due to the Alt-Right embracing Kevin MacDonald's work. That's why he basically turned on the Alt-Right and tried to debunk MacDonald's work. He seemed to be personally hurt by the fact that most White nationalists and Alt-Righters would reject him simply because he's Jewish even though he viewed himself as White and was loyal to the White nationalist/race realist cause. Cofnas basically tried to joined the Kool Kids Klub, but they kicked him out because he's a Jew, and so now he's trying to bash them.\n\nBut his attack on MacDonald wasn't merely an attack on the Alt-Right's anti-Jewish racism. He was simultaneously trying to advance the Alt-Right's race realist ideology within academia in the same paper. So, his attack on MacDonald was a bit schizophrenic in that regard. Or not if you view his paper through the lens of him trying to advance his own right-wing Jewish supremacist views. \n\nAnywho, I'll have to get to what Cofnas and MacDonald actually argued later because I have to go to gym and get ready for work.

We seek out truth and believe in 'free enterprise' capitalism (we didn't always but that's a whole separate thread) and we raise our children to be moral and fair if they do go into business.

There's not good samaritan in jewish teachings (although feel free to point one out jewish shills that are monitoring this thread!).\n\nJews love controlling choke points of capitalism, rent seeking, and using their in group bias against non jews for financial gains.  Best way I can describe jewish capitalism is 'cartel' capitalism or crony capitalism on steroids (many whites are involved as well). That's really all the JQ is and it's distorted as 'conspiracy' as a tactic to scare people away from it. The more woke you get on JQ you will see this EVERYWHERE.  Jews don't necessary have all the ownership roles or the management roles but they seek out knowledge/info/power 'choke points' that can be exploited for profit, fame, control, victimhood points which they parley into power and profit.  As always this isn't ALL Jews but it's a sizeable chunk. Many don't know they are actively subverting but they almost never bump up against broader Jewish power in any significant way.  They go with the flow.  They don't run that story, they selectively don't prosecute that person, they insert their values into media they produce, they are an antifragile group and do all this with no central hub.\n\nI was watching chat between Luke Ford and Frame Game and something Frame brought up really stuck with me.  The jew gentile relationship is 'hawks and doves.' Jews do much better with their tactics in non jewish societies. In Israel people are constantly trying to run little cons and it doesn't work as well. Even regular capitalism doesn't function well because Israel is a low trust society.  Most gentile societies are high trust societies.\n\nIt's super long doc but there's a traditional Catholic scholar that goes into this long standing economic 'relationship' with jews as well as a lot of other aspects.

I genuinely wish it is not the case but with everyday the Jew just continues to prove I am right and Israelis are some of the most vile, offensive people that I have ever encountered and I have personally no sympathy for them if and when America as a superpower offically collapses due to Wall Streets unchecked greed and the American people take matters to their own hands and that the Arab world finally unites and gives them the punishment they righteously deserve.\n\ntldr: there is an actual reason why Jews throughout all of history have been kicked out of 100s of different kingdoms and nations.

So the Jewish issue that had spread against the Jews across Europe was not because of their religion, it was because of usury and banks.\n\nIn fact, Abbas's entire doctoral thesis alleged a connection between early Zionists and *Adolf Hitler* to drive the Jews into Israel, and that Zionists created the \"fantastic lie\" that 6 million Jews had died.

The mother is \"amputated.\" One woman befriended by Dr. Neustein, a music student at a college outside New York, lost contact with all six of her children, including an infant she was breastfeeding at the time of their separation.\n\n&gt;...As for Rabbi Rosenberg, when he voiced his concerns to the rabbinate in Israel, he was brought up on charges by the\u00a0mishmeres hatznuis, the archconservative Orthodox \"modesty squad,\" which regulates, often through threats of violence, proper moral conduct and dress in the relations between men and women. The modesty squad is a sort of Jewish Taliban. According to Rabbi Rosenberg, the rapist he caught in the act was a member of the modesty squad, which charged him with the unconscionable offense of having previously been seen walking down a street in Jerusalem with a married woman. \"But it's OK to molest children,\" he adds.\n\nThis antifa style censorship and no platforming is disgusting \n\nIt's the same shirt Harvey Weinstein and his \"black cube\" spy or expected to get away with, the same shit \"anti racists\" do today with any \"racists\".\n\nThats not even to mention historical anti-progressive crimes based on fact [and confirmed by the son of the chief Rabbi of Rome](http://www.israelshamir.net/English/Eng11.htm), don't get acknowledged but actually still get suppressed TO THIS DAY\n\n&gt;Dr Toaff is the son of the Rabbi of Rome and a professor in the Jewish University of Bar Ilan, not far from Tel Aviv. He made a name for himself by his deep study of medieval Jewry. His three-volumed Love, Work, and Death (subtitled Jewish Life in Medieval Umbria) is an encyclopaedia of this admittedly narrow area. While studying his subject he discovered that the medieval Ashkenazi Jewish communities of North Italy practiced a particularly horrible form of human sacrifice.\n\n&gt;And now we come back to Dr Ariel Toaff. While going through the papers of the trial, he made a staggering discovery: instead of being dictated by the zealous investigators under torture, the confessions of the killers contained material totally unknown to the Italian churchmen or police. The killers belonged to the small and withdrawn Ashkenazi community, they practiced their own rites, quite different from those used by the native Italian Jews; these rites were faithfully reproduced in their confessions, though they were not known to the Crime Squad of the day. \u201cThese liturgical formulas in Hebrew with a strong anti-Christian tone cannot be projections of the judges who could not know these prayers, which didn't even belong to Italian rites but to the Ashkenazi tradition,\" Toaff wrote. A confession is of value only if it contains some true and verifiable details of the crime the police did not know of. This iron rule of criminal investigation was observed in Trent trials.\n\n&gt;Moreover, this Trento crime was not an exception: Toaff discovered many cases of such bloody sacrifices connected with the mutilation of children, outpouring of blood and its baking in Matzo (unleavened bread) spanning five hundred years of European history. Blood, this magic drink, was a popular medicine of the time, and of any time: Herod tried to keep young bathing in blood of babies, alchemists used blood to turn lead into gold. Jewish wizards meddled in magic and used it as much as anybody. There was a thriving market in such delicacies as blood, powder made of blood and bloody matzo. Jewish vendors sold it accompanied with rabbinic letters of authorization; the highest value was blood of a goy katan, a gentile child, much more usual was blood of circumcision. Such blood sacrifices were \"instinctive, visceral, virulent actions and reactions, in which innocent and unknowing children became victims of the love of God and of vengeance,\" Toaff wrote in the book's preface. \"Their blood bathed the altars of a God who, it was believed, needed to be guided, sometimes impatiently pushed to protect and to punish.\"\n\n&gt;This somewhat cryptic remark can be understood by reading Israeli professor Israel Yuval\u2019s book Two Nations in Thy Womb. Yuval explained that blood libations were necessary (in the eyes of Jewish magicians) to bring forth Divine Vengeance upon the Goyim. He also quotes an irrefutable (i.e. not denied by Jews) instance of blood sacrifice by a Jew. ( Read about it in my article Bloodcurdling Libel.) Toaff improved upon Yuval by stressing the ordinary magic use of blood by Jews in the Middle Ages, and by allowing for the anti-Christian element: crucifixion of victims and the cursing of Christ and Virgin. Here his book is supported by (admittedly, more timid) Reckless Rites: Purim and the Legacy of Jewish Violence by Elliott Horowitz. Horowitz tells his reader of strange rituals: flagellation of the Virgin, destruction of crucifixes and the beating up and killing Christians.\n\n", "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "WayOfTheBern", "date_year_month": "2018-05", "created_utc_converted": "2018-05-22 19:39:29", "score_overall": 11, "words": "jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish goyim jew libel jewish", "shared_words": "jewish goyim jew libel", "socre_distint": 4}

Also, a lot of American Jews are sadly very ignorant of the historic involvement of Jews in socialist movements such as Bundism, which inspires me because they fiercely opposed Zionism as antithetical to both Jewish and class liberation. (I don't believe in LARPing pre-WW2 Eastern Europe, and I suspect some of their views are problematic in settler-colonial states like the US, but nonetheless they are interesting because of how the Jewish experience informs and complements their form of socialism.) \n\n&gt;because that nuance is hard to grasp, reasonable arguments in favor of the Palestinian cause can sometimes come across as an attack on Jewishness rather than an attack on Israel's Jewish supremacy in a political context. \n\nI hear what you're saying and already agree with you. There's a clear difference between anti-Zionism and anti-Zionism that happens to also be anti-Semitic. \n\nBut then you have some leftists (such as some of the non-Jews who were previously in this thread) who are definitely anti-Zionist, but have a very poor understanding of what anti-Semitism is and how it has been used to preserve the status quo by using Jews as a scapegoat. One of the first comments in this thread accused me of \"concern trolling\" for even bringing up the topic. I have my own theories (although largely drawn from an American experience) as to why these kinds of misunderstandings happen, but it's one reason why I prefer talking about anti-Zionism to Jews rather than non-Jews. The former, even if they are more likely to be Zionists, also tend to have a somewhat more accurate conception of what anti-Semitism is, even if they haven't yet connected it to other struggles and the moral necessity of anti-capitalism. \n\nEven though anti-Zionism is not inherently anti-Semitic, I do think that anti-Semitism can be a problem in the *tone* some anti-Zionist arguments tend to take. (For instance, given the history of the blood libel against Jews, I cringe whenever I hear or read about how the Israeli military is thirsting for the blood of Palestinian children, or something along those lines.) In that regard, I think that Jews' viewpoints should at least be considered, especially by non-Jews, regardless of those Jews' standpoints on Palestine. Since anti-Semitism fuels Zionism, understanding anti-Semitism should be crucial to any anti-Zionist, but a lot of anti-Zionists (in my experience) don't take the time to do this.

{"archived": false, "author": "amw61", "body": "Most Red Pillers have a bit of an idea of what happens to a nation whose leadership challenges the Kosher Nostra, also known as the Khazarian Mafia. They think of the fate of Iraq under Saddam Hussein, Libya under Muhammed Gadhafi and \u2013 still ongoing \u2013 Syria under Bashar al-Assad. The most extreme case, though, without a doubt, must be the case of Germany under AH. No leader before or after him challenged evil as fearlessly as him. He did not mince his words, he did not pull his punches, which is all good. However, in the end, 25% of Germans, 20 million in total, mostly civilians, lost their lives, mostly after the end of \u201chostilities\u201d, the surviving population impoverished and enslaved. 95% of the civilian infrastructure got destroyed, including countless irreplaceable and priceless cultural treasures. The remaining assets got plundered by the victors. Read Thomas Goodrich\u2019s historic masterpiece \u201cHellstorm\u201d, or watch the documentary based on it by the same name.\n\nIn other words, any leadership who \u2013 for reasons I don\u2019t need to explain \u2013 comes to the conclusion that their nation has a Jewish problem must think twice. Do they want to ignore it or address it? What are the consequences of that decision? There is a good reason why the \u201cdeep state\u201d is no longer putting family parents in positions of power, only homosexuals with no children of their own. THEY know from past experience that for most parents their love for their children is stronger than their greed and ambition, making them harder to control. \n\nOnce a leader has decided that the Jewish problem must be fixed, he is faced with the dilemma of two bad choices. Whatever he does he must consider what it will do to not only his career but also what it will do to his family and the whole nation. Who right in his mind will risk making his country look like Germany at the end of World War II?\n\nTo start with, he must make sure that his country will prevail if the rest of the world, under Kosher Nostra direction, gangs up on his. Only Russia and the United States of America are in such position. However, neither Russia nor the United States need that kind of grief. Realistically speaking, both nations have to be on the same team. A war between them would be too destructive for both. What is the point of winning a war, when 95% of the country is uninhabitable and most of the people dead?!\n\nIn other words, to fight the Kosher Nostra you must have both America and Russia on your side. That\u2019s requirement number one. Not an easy one, for sure.\n\nSecondly, that leader MUST do everything in his power to avoid being labelled an anti-Semite. As much as the Jews like to argue and bicker amongst each other, they will gang up on you and destroy you the moment they decide that you are \u201cbad for the Jews\u201d.\n\nIn other words, such a leader must give them plenty of reason to believe that his policies are \u201cgood for the Jews\u201d. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean it must be good for ALL Jews. It just needs to be good for some of them, especially their hip pockets.\n\nIt is okay to hold them responsible individually for their various criminal and antisocial activities, as long as you don\u2019t hold them responsible collectively. The most important thing to avoid is showing any inclination to believe that their Jewishness might have anything to do with their antics.\n\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong. Research and awareness-building on the \u201cstatistically significant\u201d link between Jewishness and sociopathic, narcissist and manic-depressed behaviour are important for awakening purposes. However, it is one thing for an out of work blogger to make himself an unemployable social leper by publishing unflattering things about Satan's Chosen, and another to voice such views as someone in a position of power. They won\u2019t rest till you \u2013 and anyone who supports you - are destroyed. That\u2019s how they have operated for the past 3000-4000 years.\n\nSo what would have Sun Tzu done in such a situation? How can you fight such a mighty enemy without getting destroyed? How do you take on the Kosher Nostra without the entire hive of World Jewry ganging up on you?\n\nThe best way of doing this is by sucking as much kosher dick as you can fit into your mouth without throwing up. Use every opportunity to \u201cprove\u201d your never-ever ending love for Jews. Hire them, marry them to your children, do business with them, have an annual pass to every Holocaust museum in the world. Flatter their narcissism wherever and in whatever way you can.\n\nAnd while you are at it, systematically destroy their main sources of power and income. Destroy their drug income. Destroy their sex slave money. Destroy their media power. Destroy every single dirty money income stream they have.

Most \"bash the fash\" types are anarchists who want the complete opposite of fascism.\n\n&gt;1. It's really how you look at the west, everything up until 1900s were very tribal, and people identified with their own race.\n\nExcept when they identified more with their nationality, this is still the case in Europe. Our modern beliefs about race are relatively recent, it was originally pretty much synonymous with nationality.\n\n&gt;Don't insult the life's that have came before us, we owe them everything. \n\nTrue, for better or for worse our modern society was built on the actions of those who came before us.\n\nInvoking the dead claiming they would have supported your position is disrespectful, I hope when I'm dead nobody uses me for appeals to emotion.\n\n&gt;2.

Communism is a front, it sounds excellent on paper. Equal wealth? Share everything? Fuck yeah let's do it!\n\nYou've lost me, are they secretly trying to implement communism or not?\n\nThe irony here of course is that the ruling class have always been more sympathetic to fascism than socialism or communism. I know for the far-right the rich and powerful are pretty much irrelevant unless they're Jewish but objectively it's the rich and powerful who control the world regardless of race or religion. Money is power.\n\nFor the elite, socialism/communism is a threat. Regardless of whether or not the society could survive, the creation of such a society would either end with them reduced to the same level as everyone else (best case scenario) or result in a violent revolution where they will most likely be murdered possibly along with their families (worst case scenario)\n\nFascism is only a threat to the rich and powerful who are not straight, able-bodied or part of the majority race of their country. Even then they can flee. For the rest of the rich and powerful, fascism can be good for business.\n\nIf we look at National Socialism, Hitler granted the elite their biggest wish: Slave labour. The ultimate goal of the wealthy elite is to have a population who can buy their products while simultaneously having a workforce they don't have to pay.\n\nHell, Hitler was actually supported and helped into power by wealthy interests who wanted him to squash socialism and communism, hence why the first people he imprisoned were communists.\n\n&gt;It's the same jew trick as here you can have sex with this beautiful girl to if you just pretend it's you doing the job!

The final blood libel was when the Czar tried to blame the Jews on his failing rule of the country, to try and save face. This is just the tip of the iceberg. The pogroms too. How can anyone in their right mind think that Jews control the world then? They're oppressed everywhere they go, banished from one country to another, despite constantly living in ghettos and shying away from the rest of the world. \n\nMoving on: Soviet leaders are Jewish. Not unusual since most Jews are innovative in their line of thinking (see Einstein, Freud) and so an era reigns in Russia. A supposed freedom of religion is proposed and a cautious breath of air. Then the country locks down on religion and extra care is applied to make sure that Judaism doesn't breathe. Underground rabbis are caught and sent to gulags for trying to teach children Torah. Synagogues were monitored and every move was reported to the Yevsektzia, a special government unit for dealing with Jews. As the saying went then, \"It's not because of the passport (despite name change) you're smacked, but rather by your face (the appearance of a Jew).\" Stalin too believed the conspiracy of jews ruling the world. Until Stalin died, everything was done in the open, with no shame. The famous doctors' trail is an example and the public removal of Jewish doctors and scholars all over the country proved his intentions.

It is certainly a very great one; it probably outweighs all others. With the notable exception of Lenin, the majority of the leading figures are Jews. Moreover, the principal inspiration and driving power comes from the Jewish leaders. Thus Tchitcherin, a pure Russian, is eclipsed by his nominal subordinate, Litvinoff, and the influence of Russians like Bukharin or Lunacharski cannot be compared with the power of Trotsky, or of Zinovieff, the Dictator of the Red Citadel (Petrograd), or of Krassin or Radek -- all Jews. In the Soviet institutions the predominance of Jews is even more astonishing. And the prominent, if not indeed the principal, part in the system of terrorism applied by the Extraordinary Commissions for Combatting Counter-Revolution [the Cheka] has been taken by Jews, and in some notable cases by Jewesses.\"\n\n\n\nThere's a very interesting book called; *\"The Russian Roots of Nazism: White \u00c9migr\u00e9s and the Making of National Socialism, 1917-1945\"* that details how the evacuations from the Russian civil war led to an extreme amplification of anti-Jewish sentiment in the Western countries, and actually before meeting a Russian emigree organization Hitler himself was not antisemitic\n\n&gt;From 1920 to 1923, Hitler allied himself with a conspiratorial volkisch German/White emigre association headquartered in Munich, Aufbau: Wirtschafts-politische Vereinigung furden Osten (Reconstruction:Economic-Political Organization for the East). Aufbau contributed considerable sums of money to Hitler\u2019s National Socialist movement. Moreover, early National Socialist ideology combined volkisch notions of Germanic racial and spiritual superiority with the apocalyptic White emigre Aufbau conspiracy theory in which Jews, who operated as a seamless web of conniving \ufb01nance capitalists and murderous Bolsheviks, threatened to conquer the world and then to send it to perdition\n\n&gt;Vinberg held detailed ideological discussions with Hitler, and he convinced the Fuhrer that the Soviet Union represented a \u201cJewish dictatorship.\u201d \n\n&gt;Further indications of the relatively late development of Hitler\u2019s far right political ideas exist. Hitler\u2019s correspondence and private writings from World War I (1914\u20131918) lack anti-Semitic passages.13 Hitler\u2019s comrades during World War I did not detect anti-Semitic views among his beliefs.14 Moreover, according to Aide-de-Camp Hans Mend, Hitler\u2019s immediate commanding of\ufb01cer on the Western Front in World War I, Hitler occasionally praised Jews, and he exhibited socialist leanings. He often held \u201crabble-rousing speeches\u201d in which he called himself a representative of the \u201cclass-conscious proletariat.\u201d15 Hitler only began to crystallize his virulent anti-Bolshevik, anti-Semitic Weltanschauung in Munich in late 1919 in the context of intercultural collaboration between alienated volkisch Germans and radical White emigres. \n\nLater Adolf Hitler, *Mein Kampf*, **1924** followed up with;\n\n&gt;**Russia furnishes the most terrible example of such a slavery. In that country the Jew killed or starved thirty millions of the people, in a bout of savage fanaticism and partly by the employment of inhuman torture.** And he did this so that a gang of Jewish literati and financial bandits should dominate over a great people.\n\n\nOther radicalized Nazis like [Goebels gave a speech ranting on the Soviet Unions strict laws executing any and all \"anti-semites\"](http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/goeb64.htm)\n\n&gt;There is a law in the Soviet Union that punishes anti-Semitism \u2014 or in plain English, public education about the Jewish Question \u2014 by death. The expert in these matters is in no way surprised that a leading spokesman for the Kremlin said over the New Year that the Soviet Union would not rest until this law was valid throughout the world. In other words, the enemy clearly says that its goal in this war is to put the total domination of Jewry over the nations of the earth under legal protection, and to threaten even a discussion of this shameful attempt with the death penalty.\n\nIt's worth noting that Leon Trotsky, despite being \"anti-nationalist\",   actually ended up attending Jewish Zionist meetings and flirting with the idea of supporting them due to his \"hatred of Hitlerism\".\n\nJust imagine; If Trotsky and these early Bolsheviks had simply not been complete out of touch assholes, and had simply some degree of self-awareness to see the criticisms/hatred towards their rule rather than the \"no platform, no compromise\" bullshit, perhaps the Holocaust and other atrocities could have been averted?\n\nThis is not to justify German or other Nazi atrocities against Jews, but rather to highlight the importance of these international oppressive characters (early bolsheviks and those who funded them) in creating the conditions for a Nazi reaction", "score": -1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "WayOfTheBern", "date_year_month": "2018-05", "created_utc_converted": "2018-05-27 04:02:21", "score_overall": 12, "words": "jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish conspiracy jewish jew jewish jewish jewish holocaust", "shared_words": "jewish conspiracy jew holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}

{"archived": false, "author": "rubberbandrocks", "body": "&gt; Are \"the Rothschilds\" even well-coordinated enough to be worth caring about as a group these days? \n\nNo. \n\nTheir influence decreased a lot. They became famous because they pioneered the modern banking system. But their influence mostly stems from being icons and philanthropist who donated a lot to public causes so they are well received by some heads of states of businesspeople. But since the 20th century they have diluted a lot and it's impossible to claim that the Rothschilds have a general agenda. For example, Victor, Lord Rothschild was against of granting asylum or helping Jewish immigrants after the Holocaust while Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild was a Zionist. The different branches have different way of thinking and support different causes. \n\nBefore, they were immensely influential. They practically controlled the price of gold in England and owned many banks. To give a little bit of history, the first Rothschild, Mayer Amschel Rothschild, became a banker because he was placed as a \"Court Jew\". What's a Court Jew? A Court Jew was a Jew picked by the European Christian royalty. Why was a Jew picked to handle the money of the nobility back then? Why didn't they handled it themselves?\n Well, that's because the Catholic Church banned lending with taxes, *but only to Christians*. Jews weren't subjected to this ban. So the nobility picked a Court Jew to lend their money on their name. This is way it is a common stereotype to call Jews \"bankers\".\n\nToday, the economic system changed. New players came and overthrew the previous players. Now, the biggest Rothschild asset is the Rothschild group, which it isn't even the biggest bank in England. They have a lot of money, but they are not where as some people claim. \n\nNow, if by \"the Rothschilds\" you mean Jews... then the claim is simply wrong. Jews are not a monolithic secret society or anything were they gather to discuss social or political agendas. the fact that some Jews became very rich, like Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin, Larry page, George Soros, etc, doesn't mean anything. Do white people have a secret agenda because they are the richest people in the world? No. No blacks? Japanese? No. \n\nAll the conspiracy theories saying the Rothschilds, or Jews in general, control the world, the armament industry,and whatever is pure bollocks. There Jewish democrats and Jewish Republicans. There are Zionists and Anti-Zionists. The people who claim that \"The Rothschild\" control the world cannot point to any source whatsoever to back it up. They point to some shady quotes donde centuries ago about some family member said that they are the ones who cause all wars controls all banks, and so on. But most likely this quotes are fake, and even if some of them actually said the,, it still doesn't mean anything because one thing is to say something and the other is it to be true. Many people claim to be bigger or more influential than they actually are, and it would be not surprising if some Rothschild thought so too.  But in fact they are not as wealthy as people think. Today, the richest Rothschild is Benjamin de Rothschild. He is ranked #1376 in Forbes\u2019s list of billionaires with a net worth of $1.5 B. So he is not even close to have the amount of money some people try to claim the Rothschild have. \n\nI can give you sources for all I wrote here if you want, I would place them here but I'm feeling lazy right now.", "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "ethereum", "date_year_month": "2018-05", "created_utc_converted": "2018-05-27 14:33:06", "score_overall": 11, "words": "jewish holocaust jew jew jew jew jew jew conspiracy jewish jewish", "shared_words": "jewish holocaust jew conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

Even explicitly explaining this reasoning is usually enough to get someone so branded, because to the liberal mindset, if someone can understand such evil, they must be complicit in it.\n\nIn America, Jews have prospered, especially in the film industry, in journalism, in publishing, in academia, and pretty much anywhere information is currency or power.  *This is not a bad thing; America exists for the prosperity and freedom of all her citizens of every background.*  And being smart about which industries to invest in is just good business sense, something I wish more families would teach their children.

It hasn't helped that the Democrats' semi-anonymous militia, the KKK, railed against Jewish wealth and power for a century, often in \"dog-whistles,\" veiled language, justifying such watchfulness.\n\nSo, any mention of Jewish names in connection with globalist investors, think tank power players, media moguls, bleeding-heart journalists, or controllers of intellectual properties brings this whole persecution complex to mind, as if someone had said \"bankers\" or \"money-lenders\" in a pejorative tone and then spat on the ground.  And because the liberal mindset is of guilty hearts by association, any mention of \"who owns that industry\" is treated as an indirect citation of Mein Kampf.\n\nAs for me?  \"Thou shalt not covet.\"  Okey-doke, Lord.

Fifteen years ago German historian Wolfgang Eggert warned us that the **Rothschilds** belong to this fanatical doomsday cult. Recent moves by Trump and Theresa May suggest that this horrifying prophecy is coming true.\nA Munich-based historian Wolfgang Eggert, 54, believes orthodox Jews called **Chasidim** want to instigate a nuclear holocaust to fulfill Biblical prophesy.\n\nHe thinks these religious fanatics must be exposed. The largest Chasidim group, the Chabad Lubavitcher sect want to hasten Armageddon which they believe is a prerequisite for the Messiah's return. Eggert quotes a Lubavitcher rabbi who says:\"the world is waiting for us to fulfill our role in preparing the world to greet Moshiach\" (i.e. Messiah.)\n\n\"All human history is about Messianic-satanic Judaism (\"Chassidim\"); they\u00b4re \"making\" it. History and politics are a big movie, and they are the directors, bringing old-testament-prophecy into reality. They captured **Freemasonry by building up the Illuminati (through Rothschild/Jacob Frank/Weishaupt)**; they made a pact with the British monarchy when they financed William III to become king; they placed the British royals at the head of the Freemasons; they made the modern banking system and the Fed (through Rothschild); they made Zionism, the world wars, the European Union and so on. They reign through their puppets Rothschild (whose ancestors had been part of the Chassidic cult) and Rockefeller, who were the guiding force behind Bilderberg, the trilateral etc. \n\nWe are now in the \"End Times\"; they are trying to foment a \"prophesied\" Third World War.\n\n_____________\n\n\nIt takes 2 seconds to look up Racine RICO.

The Wisconsin Attorney General is also a corrupt Freemason who is close friends with those involved.

{"archived": false, "author": "amw61", "body": "Most Red Pillers have a bit of an idea of what happens to a nation whose leadership challenges the Kosher Nostra, also known as the Khazarian Mafia. They think of the fate of Iraq under Saddam Hussein, Libya under Muhammed Gadhafi and \u2013 still ongoing \u2013 Syria under Bashar al-Assad. The most extreme case, though, without a doubt, must be the case of Germany under AH. No leader before or after him challenged evil as fearlessly as him. He did not mince his words, he did not pull his punches, which is all good. However, in the end, 25% of Germans, 20 million in total, mostly civilians, lost their lives, mostly after the end of \u201chostilities\u201d, the surviving population impoverished and enslaved. 95% of the civilian infrastructure got destroyed, including countless irreplaceable and priceless cultural treasures. The remaining assets got plundered by the victors. Read Thomas Goodrich\u2019s historic masterpiece \u201cHellstorm\u201d, or watch the documentary based on it by the same name.\n\nIn other words, any leadership who \u2013 for reasons I don\u2019t need to explain \u2013 comes to the conclusion that their nation has a Jewish problem must think twice. Do they want to ignore it or address it? What are the consequences of that decision? There is a good reason why the \u201cdeep state\u201d is no longer putting family parents in positions of power, only homosexuals with no children of their own. THEY know from past experience that for most parents their love for their children is stronger than their greed and ambition, making them harder to control. \n\nOnce a leader has decided that the Jewish problem must be fixed, he is faced with the dilemma of two bad choices. Whatever he does he must consider what it will do to not only his career but also what it will do to his family and the whole nation. Who right in his mind will risk making his country look like Germany at the end of World War II?\n\nTo start with, he must make sure that his country will prevail if the rest of the world, under Kosher Nostra direction, gangs up on his. Only Russia and the United States of America are in such position. However, neither Russia nor the United States need that kind of grief. Realistically speaking, both nations have to be on the same team. A war between them would be too destructive for both. What is the point of winning a war, when 95% of the country is uninhabitable and most of the people dead?!\n\nIn other words, to fight the Kosher Nostra you must have both America and Russia on your side. That\u2019s requirement number one. Not an easy one, for sure.\n\nSecondly, that leader MUST do everything in his power to avoid being labelled an anti-Semite. As much as the Jews like to argue and bicker amongst each other, they will gang up on you and destroy you the moment they decide that you are \u201cbad for the Jews\u201d.\n\nIn other words, such a leader must give them plenty of reason to believe that his policies are \u201cgood for the Jews\u201d. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean it must be good for ALL Jews. It just needs to be good for some of them, especially their hip pockets.\n\nIt is okay to hold them responsible individually for their various criminal and antisocial activities, as long as you don\u2019t hold them responsible collectively. The most important thing to avoid is showing any inclination to believe that their Jewishness might have anything to do with their antics.\n\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong. Research and awareness-building on the \u201cstatistically significant\u201d link between Jewishness and sociopathic, narcissist and manic-depressed behaviour are important for awakening purposes. However, it is one thing for an out of work blogger to make himself an unemployable social leper by publishing unflattering things about Satan's Chosen, and another to voice such views as someone in a position of power. They won\u2019t rest till you \u2013 and anyone who supports you - are destroyed. That\u2019s how they have operated for the past 3000-4000 years.\n\nSo what would have Sun Tzu done in such a situation? How can you fight such a mighty enemy without getting destroyed? How do you take on the Kosher Nostra without the entire hive of World Jewry ganging up on you?\n\nThe best way of doing this is by sucking as much kosher dick as you can fit into your mouth without throwing up. Use every opportunity to \u201cprove\u201d your never-ever ending love for Jews. Hire them, marry them to your children, do business with them, have an annual pass to every Holocaust museum in the world. Flatter their narcissism wherever and in whatever way you can.\n\nAnd while you are at it, systematically destroy their main sources of power and income. Destroy their drug income. Destroy their sex slave money. Destroy their media power. Destroy every single dirty money income stream they have.

{"archived": false, "author": "cdesmoulins", "body": "The short answer is: *for the drama*. Shakespeare was adapting a previously-told story, the Italian author Cinthio's \"Un Capitano Moro\", and he took significant liberties with the story's characters and plot -- the skeleton of the narrative remains, but the story in its original form was unlikely to be familiar to Shakespeare's English audience. (This is pretty typical for Early Modern English drama and for Shakespeare; Shakespeare also took the skeletal plot of *Measure For Measure* from another tale by Cinthio.) The Moorish captain of the original story is still a Moorish captain, so Shakespeare wasn't imposing a racial element on the story out of nowhere -- another question might be \"what motivated Cinthio to make the title character of his tale a Moor?\" (Besides his pretense that he's simply retelling a true story that was told to him by the story's Emilia-analogue.) Cinthio's Moor isn't persecuted by his ensign on account of his race or on account of some unknown malice, but because his Iago-equivalent wants to sleep with Desdemona and is rebuffed by her; the Moor's race comes most into prominence with the matter of Desdemona's handkerchief, embroidered \"in Moorish fashion\", and with the Signori of Venice's outrage not only at Desdemona's murder but Desdemona's murder at the hands of a barbarian. Is this supposed to be a cautionary tale about not marrying outside your own race because Moors are jealous and will beat you to death with a sock full of sand (seriously) or is it a cautionary tale about not believing the lies of hunky but depraved ensigns? It's a little bit of a mixed message; the racial element is unmistakably present, but not as elaborated-upon as Shakespeare's play has it.\n\n Shakespeare took that racial element and made it even more explicit, so that it informs every character's relationship with Othello either overtly or covertly. He invented the character of Brabantio to combine the narrative roles of Desdemona's kinsmen and to an extent the presence of the Venetian signoria -- but also to give Iago somebody to interfere with to create trouble for Othello, and as a concrete representative of racial prejudice. Desdemona's parents urge her to marry someone else in Cinthio's story, but they don't use the same language of racial opprobrium to do it in, nor is the scandalous element so passionately emphasized. Shakespeare also injected a topical political element by emphasizing Othello's role in a religious conflict -- Othello isn't white, and as a Moor he might be understood as essentially non-Christian (either pagan Muslim or as Iago implies to Brabantio, out-and-out satanic) but he is allied with white, Christian Venice in the ongoing struggle against Turkish forces. This positions him as sympathetic and familiar to a Christian audience and makes him plausibly attractive to Desdemona, but it still leaves him on thin ice. Othello's strength and intelligence have been applied in the defense of Venice against the Turk, but his social acceptance in Venice is conditional, and his Moorishness sets him apart as never completely belonging there, even as a war hero with Venetian superiors, Venetian underlings, and a Venetian wife. The conflict between Christian and Turk wouldn't have been lost on Cinthio writing in Italy, but Shakespeare brings it to the forefront in a way that's absent in \"Un Capitano Moro\". In Shakespeare's play, Othello even compares himself in the act of suicide to a \"malignant and turbanned Turk\" he once slew in Aleppo -- the Turkish conflict is everywhere, as ubiquitous as the theme of race, and it situates the human drama of Othello's rise and fall in the context of a political conflict that held a place of concern in English audience's hearts not only for its religious implications but for its humanitarian concerns.  So you've got perpetually topical political conflict built in, military themes, familiar and crowd-pleasing themes of Italian impetuousness and prejudice, and the outline of a plot that incorporates romance, pathos, suspense, and tragedy, plus a passel of roles for the King's Men to take on: a really loathsome and chatty villain, a zesty flawed hero for Richard Burbage to play, an obnoxious old man, a clever maid, a beautiful and virtuous heroine who gets to lie around being unfairly maligned and tearjerking without having to give too many long speeches. It's a little sexy, a little challenging, but not too challenging. Race isn't one of the thematic elements that run the risk of a little visit from law enforcement, either, so why *not* make a play about the Moorish captain? \n\n\nIt's also possible *Othello* was written as a cash-in on a theatrical vogue for nonwhite protagonists, one that didn't leave much concrete evidence behind besides the existence of other plays with racially marginalized antiheroes and secondary black characters, and it's possible it was written as a more sympathetic and sophisticated return to the theme of interracial union and racial prejudice he'd explored maybe a decade earlier with Aaron the Moor in *Titus Andronicus*. We have records of black people living and working in England and participating in the same business activities and social obligations as their white counterparts, so a black person living in London and choosing to pay for a show and watching a performance of *Othello* isn't beyond the realm of possibility. But outside speculation, we don't know how they'd have felt about the action of the play itself -- seeing a tragedy about race and sex play out with a famous white guy pretending to be Othello? Seeing a dark-skinned tragic hero whose nobility of character is undermined by other characters' racial prejudice? Seeing an exotic black hero in an Italian tragedy and not a likeable black hero in a domestic comedy? Seeing a stage representation of a black man kiss and kill a stage representation of a white woman? Black people who saw or read *Othello* in its earliest years of performance must have had thoughts and feelings about it, but we have no written record of those thoughts and feelings. \n\n\n The limitations of the Elizabethan stage necessitated a willingness to actors playing what they weren't -- of course this is relatively innocuous when it's a bricklayer's son playing a Danish king or a Venetian beauty and somewhat less so when it's a white gentile reproducing a mean-spirited caricature of a Jewish person or a black person. Jewish characters were depicted on the English stage with relative frequency despite there being few or no people of Jewish descent in the average English audience and no actual Jewish people on the stage -- real-life \"blackamoors\" would have been more familiar to more of Shakespeare's audience than real-life Jewish people. In 1603 England you could run into a black person you knew on the street right outside the Globe Theatre, or hire a black servant, or marry a black person in your parish church, or attend the christening of a biracial baby there. Jewish people of any complexion, even ardent converts to Christianity, would have been excluded from nearly all of these things and had been excluded by law for centuries; even high-profile Jewish conversos like Roderigo Lopez were held in suspicion. So why write a play with contemporary Jewish people in it at all? The difference implied in Jewishness for a character like Shylock in *Merchant of Venice* or Barabas in *Jew of Malta* still meant something to Elizabethan audiences -- that difference signified an existential and political threat, a hostility toward Christianity and a certain parcel of villainous qualities. Shakespeare writing Jewish people in Continental Europe doesn't cleave exclusively to the territory of well-worn stereotypes about Jewish malice and greed, but neither does he deliberately flout or divorce himself from contemporary stereotypes wholesale; Jewish people were marked off as foreign, grudgingly tolerated at best, and that foreignness set them apart on the stage. Likewise Othello, being not just a London \"blackamoor\" but *a Venetian Moor*, is essentially different and essentially foreign -- not just in the way that Italian characters on the stage differ from English spectators in the audience but different even among fictional foreigners -- but as a presumed Christian, he can make a somewhat more comfortable tragic hero rather than simply an antihero. This situates the actions of such characters at a comfortable remove, rendering them exotic and dramatic rather than familiar. For that matter, the fact that the other white characters in the play are not English but Italian also situates them in an exotic, somewhat stereotyped ethnic space -- Shakespeare's plays set in Italy like *Romeo &amp; Juliet* and *Measure For Measure* and the plays of Shakespeare's contemporaries get significant traction out of contemporary English beliefs about the essential nature of Italians as passionate, temperamental, lascivious, and furthermore Catholic. Perhaps these plays got more thematic leeway as a result than they'd receive from audiences if their source-texts were transposed to familiar English surroundings. Shakespeare's *Othello* is firmly situated in the realm of foreignness and difference, even with its white characters, and that may have motivated Shakespeare to go further off the beaten track with Othello than with his other tragic protagonists.", "score": 64, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "date_year_month": "2018-05", "created_utc_converted": "2018-05-28 19:08:51", "score_overall": 14, "words": "jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish merchant jew jewish jewish greed jewish", "shared_words": "jewish merchant jew greed", "socre_distint": 4}

When millions of your ethnic group were murdered by a psychotic dictator 80 years ago, that's going to have an impact on you.\n\nSome of what you're saying isn't wrong, but it's not a \"Jewish conspiracy\", it's just plain old liberalism. White guilt is a real thing. Subverting traditional values is a real thing. Neither of those have anything to do with the ethnicity (Jews, Northern Europeans) or race (white, black, Asian) of the people promoting such.", "score": 3, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Reformed", "date_year_month": "2018-05", "created_utc_converted": "2018-05-29 21:50:47", "score_overall": 4, "words": "jew holocaust jewish conspiracy", "shared_words": "jew holocaust jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

{"archived": false, "author": "send_nasty_stuff", "body": "Welp.  That's really really difficult to unpack in a quick and Tidy way.\n\nThe first thing I always like to explain to people when dealing with JQ stuff is that this isn't some illuminati thing (although there are certainly people that go down that hole).\n\nThe jewish question is first and foremost **favoritism, i.e. nepotism.** \n\nIf you've ever heard of the 'good old boy' network that whites had in the south picture that same phenomena but a lot more intense and spread out over the entire globe.\n\nWhen jews do things (start a business, collaborate, etc) they always ask, 'is this good for the jews.' This is kinda hard for many non jews to understand because they might have aliegences to nation, god, family, community but would probably find it hard to make a local decision based on a small group of whites living in Japan or antarctica but jews through their history seem to have developed a tight tight survival bond despite being in constant diasporic positions.\n\nThe next thing to understand about jews is that they don't necessarily seek out positions of power or even positions of wealth; what they do seek out is what I like to call 'choke point' positions. A choke point position might not be the owner of an organization but the archivist or CFO or leader of an upcoming merger.  A choke point position in a small western town might not be the dude that owns the cattle ranch but you and three of your jewish friends might sit on the board of the local credit union.  You might not own a newspaper but you do write the dear abby column and on and on and on.\n\nChoke point positions can be developed into very very powerful and profitable positions over time and especially 'host cultural influence' positions over time and if you think about it it makes sense right?  If you're only 2% of the population it's in your best interest to make sure the people you live with don't develop nationalism or antisemitism. But jews have also always been at conflict with themselves because their 'actions' can cause host population resentment.\n\nI think jews more than any other race also see money not as something you spend to buy material goods and services but as a weapon to leverage people for more money and power. Lots and lots of people of all races struggle to see capital with this paradigm but it seems to come to jews very very naturally. Here's an interesting short article about this written in a very innocent way but helps illustrate the point.\n\nhttp://time.com/money/4959211/whitney-cummings-money-essay-im-fine/\n\nAnother preface to understanding the jewish people is that for thousands of years they've been a culture that highly values knowledge and education.  Every culture seems to hold up a certain ubermensch 'form' that men strive for and women want to sleep with. In jewish culture that person was the person who could memorize the most lines of the Talmud or the highest accuracy of types of food pairings that were allowed under kosher law or the one who could out argue god (that's actually a saying in judaism).  \n\nNot only was education and brain power prized but also sophistry, wit, deception and ability to tell a story. Men like this became rock stars and mated with the highest quality women and produced the most offspring. Rabbi in judaism could marry. Jews also frequently went through periods in their diaspora where they weren't allowed or didn't prefer to mate with locals so there was some inbreeding.  Jews today have some of the highest predispositions of schizophrenia (they can track their lineage with great accuracy back to 300 families! and modern genetics has confirmed these connections).  \n\nI don't say all this to necessarily put down the jews.  I think a lot of their biological development was simply a good adaptation to their conditions as traders the same way whites developed blue eyes for hunting in dark woods or western africans long legs for long treks for food.\n\nIf this adaptation stuff interests you here's a cool video on this.\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/youtube-3eV2Sc3pnBA\n\nNow how does this stuff circle around to jews being 'bad.' I really don't find all jews bad but I do believe they certainly have a very very well articulated ability to do some bad actions because they think they are protecting themselves and/or their tribe. They have an intensely heighten sense of victimhood.  Jews in communist Russia were the first ones called on to do the dirty work of the commissars because they never had any moral failings about things.  I think that's because they think they are doing it to protect their 'tribe.' They have an elaborate imagination when it comes to how deeply their tribe is being harmed and how far they will go to get 'dirty' in protecting themselves and their tribe or people helping them.\n\nAs history developed jews ran into 'gentiles' and gentiles had very very different ways of looking at the world especially after they adopted christianity.  In a way they were a lot more trusting.  Jewish tricks and lies to make profit on their trading activities and lending activities often times were so devastating with trusting whites that jews ended up owning entire cities and regions of western europe and the UK. Jews were kicked out of 109 countries 359 times.  Now does that sound like persecution or maybe they weren't the best guests? I'd love to go a lot deeper on this stuff especially the financial aspect but alas this comment is already WAY to long!\n\nOne more note is that jews are also VERY good at protecting their chokepoint, power, and financial positions once they've locked them down. They are excellent long term planners and strategist in this regard.  They make excellent business men as referenced by many strong men in history.\n\nOk so that's just a brief brief intro on the jews. Here are some documentaries I'd recommend.\n\nJews in more modern western history and gentile cultural influence.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCkc-ZF_TSY\n\nJews getting kicked out of basically everywhere and examples of their modern nepotism.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljMPafQpfDU\n\nA longer more comprehensive look at jews from a catholic historians perspective\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygCE9Y28xWg\n\nA more conversational approach about the jewish religion itself and it's contrast with christianity.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIYw3JiN7o\n\nAnd here's an ashkenazi jew and a converted jews perspective on the 'hawks vs doves' strategy of jewish 'purposeful' diaspora\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_ORHyze5H0\n\nAnd here's a comment I wrote a few weeks ago that talks about jews and 'cultural marxism.' I've shared some similar sources in this thread but there are some other sources as well.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/DebateAltRight/comments/8jfaao/i_need_some_clarification_on_white_genocide/dyzei69/\n\nBe easy on yourself as you go down this rabbit hole.  Use a critical eye.  Space out absorbing the sources.  Don't talk about it publicly as you're learning about it because people have been mentally programmed to have a knee jerk reaction to the slightest jewish critique and when you start to dig into the sources you'll see why that occurs and more accurately why it was 'installed.'\n\nHope that helps.

In truth, the cravings of oppressors would be hopeless, and the practicability of war out of the question, if there were not an army of Jesuits to smother thought and a handful of Jews to ransack pockets.\n\n\u2026 the real work is done by the Jews, and can only be done by them, as they monopolize the machinery of the loanmongering mysteries by concentrating their energies upon the barter trade in securities\u2026 Here and there and everywhere that a little capital courts investment, there is ever one of these little Jews ready to make a little suggestion or place a little bit of a loan. The smartest highwayman in the Abruzzi is not better posted up about the locale of the hard cash in a traveler\u2019s valise or pocket than those Jews about any loose capital in the hands of a trader\u2026 The language spoken smells strongly of Babel, and the perfume which otherwise pervades the place is by no means of a choice kind.\n\n\u2026 Thus do these loans, which are a curse to the people, a ruin to the holders, and a danger to the governments, become a blessing to the houses of the children of Judah. This Jew organization of loan-mongers is as dangerous to the people as the aristocratic organization of landowners\u2026 The fortunes amassed by these loan-mongers are immense, but the wrongs and sufferings thus entailed on the people and the encouragement thus afforded to their oppressors still remain to be told.\n\n\u2026 The fact that 1855 years ago Christ drove the Jewish moneychangers out of the temple, and that the moneychangers of our age enlisted on the side of tyranny happen again chiefly to be Jews, is perhaps no more than a historical coincidence.

{"archived": false, "author": "MajorParts", "body": "You're right, at least in terms of a public debate - part of the reasoning is to persuade the audience, not necessarily the speaker. An example of this would be the Bill Nye &amp; Ken Ham debate on Young Earth Creationism, neither was ever going to persuade the other, but rather the point was to educate the audience.\n\nI still think that Holocaust Denial is a special case, however. A debate is so much more likely to bring increased publicity for the Holocaust Denier, rather than the person debating them. Furthermore, Holocaust Deniers are on principle arguing in bad faith - not only are they not committed to general principles of productive debate/discussion, but their entire goal is to falsify the historical record, misconstrue facts or remove them from context, make false references or references that contradict them, and otherwise frustrate and disrupt any attempt to actually engage with and disprove their ideas. The nailing pudding to a wall analogy is a good one for many reasons (would perhaps be more accurate to think of the pudding as filled with a virulent toxin/bacterial disease). If your goal is to make pudding stick to a wall (show why a Holocaust Denier is incorrect), while avoiding getting pudding everywhere (spreading or exposing others to Holocaust Denial ideology/tactics removed from context), trying to nail the pudding to the wall (debate the denier) is a terrible way to go about it. Far better to spend the time understanding why you can't nail pudding to a wall, what makes it so hard to make pudding stick to a wall, or observe others' past (likely futile) attempts to nail pudding to a wall.\n\nAs an example of what it takes to debate a Holocaust Denier, consider [this 349 page written judgement](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2000/115.html) from [an unsuccessful libel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_v_Penguin_Books_Ltd) brought by a prominent Holocaust Denier (David Irving) against a Professor of Jewish History and the Holocaust (Deborah Lipstadt) and Penguin Publishing company, who published Lipstadt's book *Denying the Holocaust* (1993). If you're especially keen, [here are the court transcripts](https://www.hdot.org/trial-materials/trial-transcripts/). This is an example of the pudding being nailed to the wall - all it took was 32 days in court and thousands of pages of expert evidence provided by historians such as Professor Richard J. Evans to refute Irving's arguments and establish that, indeed, Irving had distorted, manipulated, and falsified history in the pursuit of Holocaust Denial and Nazi Rehabilitation. \n\nWhat it comes down to is the orders of magnitudes of difference in the amount of effort required to create bullshit and the amount required to refute it, compounded by the fact that this particular bullshit is irredeemably and irretrievably toxic, virulent, and rooted in bigotry, Nazism, and anti-semitism. Nobody watching a debate has the time, nor inclination, to watch 32 days of arguing, and read thousands of pages of written evidence, just to understand the full context of why a Holocaust Denier's arguments are incorrect, twisted, taken out of context, etc. \n\nFurthermore, the only benefit derived for the audience of a debate with a Holocaust Denier is the possibility of a better understanding of the Holocaust, just how absurd the idea is that it didn't happen, and the tactics and goals of Holocaust Deniers. However, all of these things can be better acheived without having to cede any legitimacy to the Holocaust Denier by agreeing to a debate (there isn't anything to debate), exposing anyone to the ideology of Holocaust Denial (and potentially sending them down an online path leading to stormfront or conspiracy theory youtube channels), or wasting anyone's time by watching/participating in a debate where one party has no intention to engage constructively. The honest debater would likely spend all their time disproving absurd claims made by the denier, only for the denier to move on to some new falsified or twisted argument. The honest debater would have less time to actually educate the audience about the holocaust in a constructive context, as the denier would be making that more difficult by purposefully being disruptive and forcing people to acknowledge and respond to their falsehoods. \n\nGoing back to the virulent disease analogy, exposing yourself to one is probably not the best way to study biology/virology/epidemiology. You are likely to get sick and potentially infect others. Best not to give the disease a vector of transmission (or the Holocaust Denier a platform/cede legitimacy to them), nor risk getting yourself sick (being exposed to a purposefully distorting, confusing, and false narrative). Far better to study the disease in a contained environment, and observe the effects of the disease without exposing yourself (or anyone else) to it (study the Holocaust and Holocaust Denial without engaging with Holocaust Deniers). Or, if exposure must occur, to vaccinate beforehand (learn about the Holocaust &amp; Holocaust Denial beforehand, in a constructive context).\n", "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "CanadaPolitics", "date_year_month": "2018-05", "created_utc_converted": "2018-05-31 04:55:29", "score_overall": 26, "words": "holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust libel holocaust jewish holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust conspiracy holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust", "shared_words": "holocaust libel jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

I've known her as Roseanne Barr, Roseanne Arnold, just \"Roseanne\", then back to Roseanne Barr. I've spent time in her home, criss-crossed the country with her to help remove George W. Bush from the White House, appeared on her shows, been there for her when she needed something, and connected her with one of my producers who did an insightful, one-of-a-kind documentary into the genius and the tragedy that is Roseanne Barr.\n&gt;\n&gt;On Tuesday Roseanne posted hateful, slanderous tweets directed at four people: George Soros, Valerie Jarrett, Chelsea Clinton and me. A few hours later, she was fired by ABC.\n&gt;\n&gt;For the past few years, Roseanne has been posting the craziest stuff on Twitter, like claiming Hillary was part of a child sex abuse ring being run out of a DC pizza place. She's claimed that the Clintons have murdered people. And anyone who criticizes Benjamin Netanyahu is a \"nazi.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;Roseanne seems to be suffering from some sort of madness. It's more than just saying she's a racist. She operates in the same sewer of lies, conspiracy theories and bigotry that's been rising in America for years and that has now succeeded in electing our current president. Totally nuts.\n&gt;\n&gt;Here's who's not crazy: Donald J. Trump.\n&gt;\n&gt;Trump, though he shows all the signs of being absolutely bonkers, is not insane. He's the real deal. His racism and hate is real, it's well thought-out, he's the true master of manipulation, a brilliant performance artist, and an evil genius. He outsmarted a nation of liberals and Democrats and won the White House by losing the actual vote of the people. He neutered and then destroyed the Grand Old Republican Party. He knows exactly what he is doing.\n&gt;\n&gt;Roseanne, on the other hand, is a person who long ago broke through and brought an authentic voice of working women and men to television via one of the greatest TV series of all time. It was groundbreaking because the TV industry had historically either ignored, ridiculed or patronized those of us who grew up in the working class. Roseanne changed that.\n&gt;\n&gt;But she is also a damaged soul. Most people don't know that she has suffered her entire life from a massive head injury she received during a serious car accident when she was a child. Her brain injuries were immense and she spent months in the hospital struggling to recover.\n&gt;\n&gt;I also have no idea what it was like to grow up, as she did, as a Jewish girl in Salt Lake City. Not a tolerant state, to be sure. She told me how her parents, who owned an apartment building, were asked by the U.S. government after World War II if they would be willing to house Holocaust survivors who had come to the U.S. as refugees. Her parents took dozens in, and Roseanne's childhood was spent with these survivors as her \"family.\" \"The stories they told me,\" she said, \"were filled with unimaginable horror. I've always wondered what effect that had on me as a little girl.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;Now, sadly, for the past few years, Roseanne has been in a downward spiral, ranting like crazy on Twitter, spreading conspiracy theories, attacking the people she used to love, supporting Trump, and being just an outright hateful and racist person. It has been a difficult decline to witness. She has repeatedly attacked me, and on Tuesday, after calling George Soros a \"Nazi\" (he's a Jew and a Holocaust survivor), Valerie Jarrett an offspring \"of the Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes,\" and saying that Chelsea was \"married to\" a Nazi relative of George Soros, she then retweeted a disgusting new word for me because I have spoken out against the Netanyahu government and its killing of Palestinians -- \"#JewHater\". Nonstop insanity and sickness.\n&gt;\n&gt;I guess there might be 20 million Americans (out of 320 million) who probably agree with her. She has thrown down with the lowest of the low, and who knows if she\u2019ll ever recover from this descent into her own personal hell.\n&gt;\n&gt;To close, I want to say just how great the new Roseanne show was. It was funny but brutal to watch because it showed how our system of greed has hurt millions of families like the Connors of Illinois. On the final episode last week, Roseanne was addicted to opioids because she couldn't afford the knee surgery she needed, so she suffered along in agonizing pain. Dan, her husband, in order to raise money for her surgery, decided to take a non-union job -- and Roseanne berates him for doing so and letting his union brothers and sisters down. There are a couple quick knocks on Trump, making it clear that the real Roseanne was not writing or running this show. For the past 9 weeks, the new Roseanne show has shined a powerful and necessary light on what it means to be working class in 2018. Her blended family on this new series was white and black and LGBTQ, and her generous neighbors next door were Muslims who forced her to confront her own bigotry.\n&gt;\n&gt;If only her art could have helped her in her real life.\n&gt;\n&gt;(Also, let me say this: There's no reason the show has to go just because she's gone. Over the years, TV has found ways to bring Bobby Ewing back from the dead on \u201cDallas\u201d, forced us to accept the two Darrins on \u201cBewitched\u201d, and found ways for hit shows to survive when their stars bolted after a year or two [David Caruso on \"NYPD Blue\", Pernell Roberts on \"Bonanza\"]. The smart people who were writing this Roseanne series can surely find a way to let the non-bigoted portion of the America's working class [which I can tell you is the VAST majority] have their voice heard on network television.

{"archived": false, "author": "[deleted]", "body": "Planning writing a post on the JQ and looking for input/criticism. If you are not aware, the JQ is the Alt\\-Right resurrecting the old Jewish Question. It is not a very gentle essay, perhaps offensive at some points, but I hope people appreciate the honesty. Outline:\n\n1\\) There are two kinds of potential JQ. JQ1 is rightist accusing Jews for being the main driving force behind leftism. JQ2 is people are not even necessarily leftist just generally hating Jews, often they are themselves leftish kind of people who hate Jews for being too succesful in capitalism and owning too much wealth. Or being too successful rightist nationalists in Israel.  This article is about the JQ1. JQ2 is pretty much just a dumber form of socialism and uninteresting for me.\n\nPro JQ1 arguments:\n\n\\- There is hierarchy of victimhood, in the sense you get more outrage if you offend the higher ranking groups, and in case of internally given offense the lower ranking victim yields. Currently, it is women \\&lt; gays \\&lt; blacks \\&lt; Jews. For example, a feminist accusing black men of being rapey would have a bad time, because blacks out\\-victim women, at least currently. Why are Jews the apex victims, despite being a succesful minority?  Part of the reason is that there is a hierarchy of villains corresponding to the hierarchy of victims. If you offend women, you are an asshole. If you offend gays, you are a bigoted asshole. If you offend blacks, you are a bigoted, racist asshole. If you offend Jews, you are Hitler. Why is Hitler the apex villain? Because he was incredibly harmful for a wide variety of people, Russians,  Greeks, Poles, Jews etc. However, today, it seems Hitler's apex villainhood is entirely \"about\" Jews. Somehow Jews made the entire Nazism narrative about the Holocaust, and people hardly even remember the starving of the Greeks, the murder of the Polish intellectual classes and many other Nazi crimes. So Hitler made immense amounts of bad karma by murdering a lot of different people and then in the popular narrative all this bad karma was focused on Hitler murdering Jews. This suggests, that in the media there is not only a Progressive bias but also a Jewish bias independent of it. Progressives, on their own, would not put a succesful minority into the apex victim role. They would much rather put some group whose central member can hardly even get a job on top of the victimhood hiearchy. \n\n\\- If the root of Progressivism is the \"Brahmin\" class giving a middle finger to the \"Optimate\" class, or priests taking control over from warriors, it is hard to miss how typically nerdy, book\\-learny Jews make ideal \"Brahmins\", and were considered not to have the warrior virtues, at leat not until Moyshe Dayan surprised the world.  It is still a class conflict, not ethnic, but seeing how being a good Talmudist is a lot similar to being an ACLU lawyer \\(interpret the law creatively and twist it until you win\\) it is the ideal class conflict for Jews.\n\nAnti\\-JQ1 arguments:\n\n\\- Who are even Jews? Is it software \\(ethnic consciousness\\) or hardware \\(race, genetics\\) ? Most Alt\\-Righters say mostly hardware but also software. The software argument is easily dismissed. Progressivism as software easily outcompetes Jewish ethnic consciousness, just like it does with the gentile ones. The typical caricature of a vulture looking Jew rubbing his hands over having screwed over some gentiles is idiotic as far as ideologies go: ideologues who lie about their beliefs are always outcompeted by ideologues who manage to convince themselves the belief is true and thus sound sincere. A good proof for this is sacrificing their own interests. Sincere ideologues always do that. Jewish Progressives allow Muslims who generally hate them immigrate. This is proof that that they sincerely believe in Progressivism and are not just using it as a tool. So any Jews who push Progressive ideology are in fact sincere and honest Progressives and their ethnic consciousness is long gone. \n\n\\- But the Alt\\-Right says anway that it is mostly hardware. Race. Genes. In that case the problem is the following. Every intelligent person knows race is ancestry, family tree, pedigree, and not color or looks. But on the other hand, people pretty much always use the looks heuristic to figure out someone's race. E.g. people think you are half\\-Asian because you look half\\-Asian. Even if you don't have a half\\-Asian identity, you will have a \"person who is always treated like a half\\-Asian\" identity because that is what you get from your social environment.  But many, many Jews look perfectly white. In that sense, you can say that if Jews are a race, they are the invisible race.  But if outmarriage whitened the skins of the Jews, how comes it did not take the ethnic group interest genes Kevin MacDonald talks about out of them? And outmarriage is actually a signal of low ingroup cohesion. At the very least one can say white skinned Jews are the least likely of all Jews to pursue ethnic group interests.  And most importantly, any Jews with strong ethnic consciousness have long aliyahed to Israel. The remaining ones are self\\-selected for low ethnic consciousness.\n\n\\- Believing that an invisible race runs the media and mostly everything is a perfect way to go mad. Because you cannot really test it. So you lose contact with the mindset that ideas should be tested against reality. This is why most antisemites I know are totally crazy. You can hate blacks without going crazy because you can at least tell who the blacks are. If a white dude took your job at least you know he is a white dude. But if a white dude stole your job what if he is not actually white but of the invisible race? And madness lies that way. It is a perfect recipe for constant paranoia and just losing contact with reality. On the other hand believing that Progressives run the media is perfectly rational: most of them went to the Ivy League universities, the centers of Progressive thinking. They were literally schooled to be Progressives. \n\nAs a summary, my current verdict is that rightists shouldn't JQ, that is, should not bother about the JQ1 \\(and of course never about the JQ2, the JQ2 is stupid\\). Rightists should on opposing Progressives for being Progressives, not be surprised when so many of them turn out to be Jews, but oppose them for being Progressives, not for being Jews. While Jews make ideal Brahmins and Progressivism is an \"all power to the Brahmins!\" idelogy, and while the Progressive establishment seems to be bent a bit towards Jewish ethnic interests, consider Progressivism as something that has a weak Jewish flavor to it, nothing more, don't consider it a Jewish ethnic conspiracy.

{"archived": false, "author": "Wasserkopp", "body": "&gt;Their view of racial power relations is warped as you pointed out yourself. If a liberal thinks whites are 'more' racist and they want to speak out against white racism that's fine I won't attack them. They're just not allowed to say whites are the only ones who can be racist. That's blatantly false historically and logically. If they deny examples of other group racism then that's when you pin them back down with charges of anti white racism. It's simple and it works.\n\nI'm aiming for maximum nuance and accuracy here:\n\nIf their views are warped, then that's what one's dealing with, warped views - warped views ought to be refuted.\n\nIf they think certain anti-white-discrimination simply levels the playing field to ensure fairness for everyone!, and then that isn't actually the case, they're not malicious nor even racist themselves -  they simply should be explained why that's not the case, and if they're convinced they'll stop this policy without really changing their core values.\n\nDenying that other groups can be racist, is denialism not anti-white racism - it *can* be a manipulative tactic in order to neutralize opposition to anti-white racism that they actually know exists, but as with all possible hidden motivations it's not reasonable to treat them as facts.\n\nSome people that deny the holocaust, want people to relax about \"never again\" so they can have an easier time to do another holocaust - others just happened upon claims that they ended up believing, others like conspiracy theories and revisionism, and others might be denying it because they'd rather it hadn't happened etc.\n\nSo denying the holocaust =/= antisemitism or nazism, but many dorks on the left don't quite get that. \n\nDenying global warming doesn't mean you actually want the planet to be destroyed, although in that case obviously hardly anyone wants that :D\n\n&gt;It's a possibility but whites have shown to be less violent then other racial groups so I don't see the danger. \n\nWell from what I know, certainly current white culture is less violent and tolerant than others or the minorities that live in it.\n\n&gt;Regardless the alternative is a slow steady march into oblivion and minority status in the country we founded.\n\nThat's another reason in favor if white identitarianism, in fact it resembles the reasons leftists use to justify it for other groups - Jews facing persecution, blacks facing discrimination i.e. as a defensive measure.\n\n&gt;The bottom line here is that the alt right believes that you can't have western society without european people. England is not England without native britons. Culture is downstream from race. If whites fall into the minority western civilization is over as we know it.\n\nThere are two aspects to be distinguished here: aesthetics and colorite that could be diluted or displaced by foreign immigration - and objective high-stake issues like living standards, safety, policies determined by the populace and government etc.\n\nRegarding the latter, if white displacement is a hazard to those values and standards, then obviously pragmatic white nationalism should be adopted even by those that aren't really emotionally attached to race or culture stylistics.\n\nSo far I'm on board with the notion that it's a hazard, if not for all eternity (due to genes and whatnot) and certainly for the foreseeable future as long as the racial statistics remain the way they are.\n\n&gt;Do you really believe that hispanics, blacks, asians and jews are really that different than Muslims? They all want their own version of society. I agree with you that the Muslims are more open about their desire to put the white world under the thumb of sharia law but I PROMISE you that a majority jewish, majority black, majority hispanic will seek to shape the culture and government into their own particular vision and that's NOT a white western vision. Civic nationalism is a ruse.\n\nThe Muslims are the most organized and unified under this ideological goal, even with all their internal sectarian strife.\n\nSome blacks have disorganized resentment against whiteys but as far as I'm aware the only organized groups are like crazy Nation (of Islam, ironically) yellers that don't really matter.\n\nRecently I've heard something about a Hispanic ideology aiming to take the Americas from the Anglos, but I don't think it's prevailing or present in most of their countries?\n\nAsns living in the West, and countries like Japan? Uh didn't know they tried to take over anyone? Not sure about China. NK is crazy and is considered a major threat by most.\n\nAs for Jews, I've no idea what their various factions want with the west; the religious, orthodox ones over in the ME can be as crazy as the muslims (some of them tried to lynch Sacha Baron Cohen for wearing drag lol) but unless it's all been a huge (((LIE))) their religion isn't as proselytizing or expansionist as Islam or Christianity and I'm not aware of any agenda to spread fundamentalist Judaism in the west.\n\nJQers talk about them hijacking the West for their zionist wars with the muslims, that'd be a problem obviously but mostly because of all the fallout.\n\nOther than that, what's up with those that hate whites and want them to disappear somehow? Push for liberalism just to weaken the nations? Is it revenge for history, something else? Whatever it is it's obviously an entirely different animal from any of those unruly thug cultures.\n\nHowever I've no idea how far that extends vs. how many of all those jews in the media are simply leftists like everyone else. Many of them obviously naively push for tolerance and socjus and civnat because they think it'll ensure their safety, which is either stupid and backfiring if socjus - and if aiming for race neutral civnat, then saying civnat is a ruse because Jews want to trick everyone into civnat so they're not discriminated against is obviously a bit of a circular isn't it :D\n\nBut JQ, I dunno. The unruly thugs and the weird agenda manipulators aside, what is it that those groups want that's so antithetical to the west?\n\n________\n\n&gt;I promise in most cases you will still be considered a racists. There's no end to the kafkatrap. Unless the person is young and not very exposed to western media. Otherwise you will just be called a racist unless you make the first attack. The first one to call racist wins because there's no way to defend the charge. Saying 'I'm not a racist' over and over makes you look like a big racist.\n\nAnd saying \"no you're the real racists, whites are endangered\" won't win the argument either, they're already used to hearing those arguments and seeing them laughed at.\n\nI think civil discourse where they feel they've been understood and their thoughts all addressed properly, is the best chance at getting through to anyone, in general - if they're gonna still yell at you, they were gonna yell at anything anyway.\n\n&gt;They didn't respect you in the first place. It was ALWAYS a power game and this is why diverse societies almost never work especially if the media is run by a group hell bent on agitating the minority against the majority. It's constantly a struggle.\n\nThey'll respect even less in one case, and with some probability might start respecting more in the other case.\n\nHowever I'm not sure what this argument is at this point, since you already agreed that conversation can work - hearing out their pov, understanding where they're coming from and then responding etc.\n\n&gt;Again. They don't have to adopt both viewpoints. The same way jews don't have to see eye to eye on everything. But they do have to do what's 'best for the jew' This is basically the white version of that.\n\nWell as I said \"best for the whites\" could very well entail that jews are restricted from nepotism and whites are allowed, or that blacks are restricted from forming their own neighborhoods while asians are allowed etc.\n\nEither you push this view, or you push the \"identitarianism either for everyone or for no one or for everyone in the same measure\" - and altright is known for representing the former view so them espousing the latter wouldn't be credible.\n\n&gt;You know what else is stupid? Allowing my race to bred out of existence while other people around the world have laws in place to protect their racial homogeneity. Whites deserve a homeland and if we aren't going to get one and the world thinks we have to share our conquered territory with non whites then I'm not going to let them team up on me legally, financially and socially. I'm not going to allow my own libertarian laws and people through coordinated media efforts be used against me.\n\nYes but the wrong behavior can worsen the situation and boost the support for white displacement, that's what I was talking about - counterproductivity.\n\nAgreeing to get conquered is stupid, yes, but deciding not to get conquered and then doing things that end up facilitating being conquered, is also stupid.\n\n&gt;Last time I check whites were called out for this too.\n\nWhat, racist jokes?

Asshole.\n\n&gt;Ok, so many things in your example don't make any sense at all. First, Jews were not a privileged class in medieval Europe, they were often an oppressed class only permitted to be in certain professions, while \"whites\" today are still benefitting from the system of oppression of previous generations of \"whites\". While I am personally against affirmative action, and don't believe in punishing present generations for crimes of their ancestors to make things \"fair\" I do believe that at the very least recognition of this fact is a positive.\n\nYeah, fuck off.\n\n&gt;I am not in favor of any affirmative action, however, given the history of the United States I can understand why they implemented it, but I still believe it is a hinderance to all of society.\n\nHow about instead of \"I understand why they implemented it\" you try and tell me how it's any different from quotas against Jews. \"Durrr because whites have it too good and need to be taken down a few notches, and Jews don't.\" That's racist, obviously.\n\n&gt;Because it doesn't mean shit. It doesn't mean anything that Christians \"at least preached\" the Golden Rule, so I don't know why you eve brought it up, because most religions preach it, so what's the point of even bringing it up. You brought the Golden Rule up not me.\n\nBecause I'm pointing out that you're no less bigoted or oppressive than the religious right types who came before you, and for some reason you think that's okay because \"no tolerating and intolerance\" and \"I'm on the right side of history\". Basically, you're not even attempting to make a moral case for persecuting the groups of people you don't like, you're just invoking power dynamics, which makes you look like an authoritarian bully.\n\n&gt;I like the Golden Rule, but Nazi's are Nazi's, theocrats are theocrats, homophobes are homophobes, sexists are sexists, and bigots are bigots.

Quite the opposite of devious, it dominates by merely exploiting the overall, mealymouthed, chickenbutt-kissing \"Code of Normality\" (or CON) of ALL the Pinks, norm-worms and mere-humes at large. There is no more insidious and subtle a weapon than that. \n\n&gt;This Conspiracy has no face; we know it only by it's desires... a great Mirror of Disfigurement, it reflects what is wrong with everyone.

A cancer of the imagination, the hatred of the real, the yearning for \"cuteness,\" the eagerness to obey... Oh sure, people LOVE new things - like Michael Jackson is \"new\" compared to The Beatles. But if, say, a REAL JESUS were to appear, well, it might look just a bit TOO new to be allowed to run loose for very long. \n\n&gt;This fear of the unfamiliar permeates society; it's what let's the CON get away with REAL MURDER on a massive scale. Guaranteeing obedience requires little effort on the part of any Conspiracy \"ringleaders\"; the stinking Normals happily supply the obedience themselves.

I don't think that the propensity of people all over the world to hate Jews would necessarily not also exist with Hamas, but absent Israel, antisemitism almost certainly drops out of their platform.\n\n&gt;No, but they have an equal claim.\n\nAt least in 1947, I disagree. Now, it's murkier because there have been several generations of Israelis who have lived in Israel and consider it their homeland.

(For context, Jews are about 1.4% of the total US population. Non-Hispanic blacks are about 12% of the total US population. Muslims are about 1.1% of the total US population.)\n\nThat's all of America. What about the New York City metro area, which has the highest concentration of Jews in the entire country?

{"archived": false, "author": "MuninTheRaven", "body": "&gt; my initial reaction was that you've just got some scary jew pictures, but it is interesting to see the way they've manipulated the wikipedia wording:\n\n&gt; &gt; whose disappearance and murder was **blamed on** the leaders of the city's Jewish community, based on his dead body **allegedly** being found in the cellar of a Jewish family's house, and the confessions of Jews obtained **under judicial torture**\n\n&gt; those words are very carefully planted to sew doubt in the reader. its not random.\n\nSo this is talking about the death of Simon of Trent, a toddler who was found dead in the city of Trent in 1475; his death was blamed on the three local Jewish households which resulted in the trial and execution of many Jewish men in the community. The implication here is that (((Wikipedia editors))) wrote the article to mask the guilt of the Jewish population. Surprise surprise, what happened to Simon isn't so cut and dry.\n\nSome context:\n\nBlood libel accusations weren't really new at the time, but they were gaining in popularity. The first time Jews were accused of practicing ritual murder was in the 13th century in the town of Fulda; there, 34 Jewish citizens were tried, convicted, and executed based on little evidence (there were no witnesses and all confessions were extracted via torture). Later, Emperor Frederick II condemned what had happened, precisely because there was so little support for the claims. Then, after another accusation and trial in 1247, Pope Innocent IV actually banned ritual murder trials because of the inanity of the claims and because the accused received such unfair treatment. Pope Gregory X also condemned these trials, stating that Jewish people must not be arrested for blood libel, unless there were actual eyewitnesses.\n\nSo what specifically happened in Trent?\n\nTwo-year old Simon went missing a few days before Easter. His father asked that the Jewish households be searched because a Swiss man, Zanesus, tipped him off. An initial search turned up nothing; the next day, however, a servant discovered Simon's body in the cellar of one of the three Jewish homes. The heads of the households met and decided the best course was to report the body to the police and maintain their innocence. Samuel, whose house the body was found in, was arrested and tortured for four days, after which he admitted to having strangled the boy with another Jewish man--no mention was made of using the blood for ritual purposes, though. Two months later, after being subjected to more torture, he confessed--on the condition that the torture stop and that he *only* be burnt alive--that they used Simon's blood to make mazza for their Passover feast. Similar means were used to extract confessions from other members of the Jewish population. By the end of the (first) trial, 8 men had been executed.\n\nSome quick points to mention:\n\n* The main issue that historians have with the proceedings was the overreliance on torture. Torture is known to be ineffective, in that victims will often say *anything* to stop it--regardless of the truth. See what Samuel (the household head) gave as conditions for his confession--burning to death was a better fate than continued torture. Ariel Toaff, who the OP in /r/conspiracy cited in the original thread, wrote a book called *Passovers of Blood* which dealt extensively with the death of Simon of Trent and other accusations against Jews. He argued that the accusations had weight, *because* of the confessions. What the OP did not mention, though, was that shortly after his book's release he pulled it from publication, redacted his claims, and re-edited it to reflect the fact that information gained via torture is not reliable. Pope Sixtus IV heard about the excessive use of torture in the first trial and decreed that a new trial be held, under new guidance, to ensure that there was actual weight to these claims. Guess what happened? More torture, no solid evidence, and the execution of 6 more Jews.\n\n* The issue of whether or not any members of the Jewish community were involved in Simon's death is not very cut and dry; however, the claim that they used his blood for ritualistic purposes is very easily disproved. Samuel specifically confessed to using the body's blood to make mazza for their Passover feast. That year, the Passover feast began the Wednesday before Easter, and so the mazza had to be prepared and eaten that night. Where was Simon at that time? Still safe at home; he didn't disappear until the next day. What's more, Samuel confessed to killing him on Friday: two days after the mazza was supposed to be eaten.\n\n*  One of the Jewish households, when it was reported that Simon was missing, was so worried about being framed that they actually ordered all their windows closed so that nobody could throw his body into their house. Earlier, I mentioned the Swiss man, Zanesus; he had lost a lawsuit against Samuel and held a grudge against him, and it's theorized that he might have been trying to frame the Jewish population. Notably, when he was examined in the trial, it was done so without the use of torture; later on, someone actually *accused* him of the murder (Anzelinus--a Christian), and he was again re-examined--again without torture.\n\nSo back to the quote at the very top of this comment:\n\nYes, it's accurate to say that the murder was blamed on the Jewish community; the trial was definitely not up to our current judicial standards and absolutely did not prove anything. Yes, it's important to note that the confessions were obtained via judicial torture (if anything, that one line doesn't really say enough about the *extent* of the torture). The only thing I would (gasp) agree with the comment on is \"allegedly\", given that the body was indisputably found in the cellar.

We are an [ethnoreligious people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnoreligious_group) (in much the same way that the French are an [ethnolinguistic people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnolinguistic_group)), and we have always considered ourselves a nation among other nations. Our earliest mythological texts - written thousands of years ago - describe ourselves in that way. [Archaeological evidence points to the organic emergence of Jewish identity from among the Canaanite population in the Levant after the Bronze Age Collapse.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_ancient_Israel_and_Judah)\n\nThis makes Judaism unlike Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism - which are proselytizing imperial religions shared by multiple self-identified [nations.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation) How badly Christians are oppressed because of their Christianity is irrelevant: they aren't a nation and thus not entitled to a nation-state. Those oppressed Christians can avoid persecution by ceasing to be Christians - but antisemitic oppression often targets atheist Jews and Jews who've converted into another religion. [Antisemitism, throughout history but most acutely in the modern era, is racialized.](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007171) See also [here.](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/anti-semitic-stereotypes-of-the-jewish-body/)\n\nJudaism is the religion of the Jewish nation. It is not perfectly coterminous with the Jewish people. To be considered religiously Jewish, a person needs to convert or have been born to a Jewish mother; patrilineal Jews are part of the Jewish people, even though they aren't religiously Jewish. That's why Israel includes anyone with a single Jewish grandparent within the Law of Return. Furthermore, an \"[atheist Jew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_atheism)\" makes perfect sense, but an \"atheist Muslim\" etc. does not. In fact: [the early Zionists, and even the first few decades of Israel's political leadership, was almost entirely atheist and secular.](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-how-israel-went-from-atheist-zionism-to-jewish-state-1.5488653) \n\nJews are a native people forced into diaspora by successive invading armies. We were ethnically cleansed from our homeland repeatedly and have always desired to return. And we have always expressed that desire in the political language of the day. \n\nIn the ancient world, dominated by narratives about conquering generals like Alexander the Great and Caesar, we wrote about and hoped for a successful military conquest led by a charismatic general - thus the [Maccabean revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maccabean_Revolt) and the [Bar Kohkba revolt.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt) In the medieval world, dominated by narratives of direct divine intervention during the apocalypse, we wrote about and hoped for a purely miraculous salvation - thus the [opinions of medieval Jewish thinkers that our restoration will be done by God Himself.](https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/148182/jewish/Who-Will-Build-the-Third-Bais-Hamikdash-Man-or-G\u2011d.htm) \n\nAnd in the early modern world, dominated both by the ideas of nation-states and colonialism, we used that language as well. We formed [organizations whose names have completely different associations today than they did when they were founded.](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-colonization-association-ica) And we did it to create a secular Jewish nation-state in the Jewish homeland. The Zionist Congress, the organization of diaspora Jews seeking to create a Jewish nation-state, [voted to reject any proposals for a Jewish state outside of the Levant in 1905.](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/first-to-twelfth-zionist-congress-1897-1921#7) Remember that the [Balfour Declaration was issued in 1917,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration) predating the Holocaust by over a decade. The point was always to return to our national homeland.\n\nI agree with you that \"Jews escaping antisemitism is what feeds Zionism,\" but it's not the only force \"feed[ing] Zionism.\"\n\nZionism is the modern political ideology of Jewish nationalism. It is a big-tent ideology that includes a huge variety of different political beliefs, ranging across the entire political spectrum. It is **not** above criticism. *But* a significant amount of \"criticism\" of Zionism and Israel is antisemitism in disguise. See [here](https://crossingenres.com/does-your-progressivism-include-jews-b2247a58dac4) and [here](http://this-is-not-jewish.tumblr.com/post/34344324495/how-to-criticize-israel-without-being-anti-semitic) for a general explanation of where the line between \"criticism of a nationalist movement and nation-state\" and \"bigotry against that nation and people\" blurs, and how to separate antisemitism from political criticism of Israel.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nFull disclosure: I am of the opinion that there is a lot of semantic gamesmanship involved in anti-Zionism. Because \"Zionism\" is the political belief that Jews are entitled to a nation-state like all other nations are, \"anti-Zionism\" in my understanding is the negation of that - the belief that Jews are not entitled to a nation-state. \n\n**Opposing specific actions that the Israeli government takes is not anti-Zionism!** No country is above criticism. Most Jewish Zionists (and that's most Jews, period) criticize Israeli policies without wanting to destroy the Jewish nation-state. If that's what \"anti-Zionism\" means to you, then you're in good company with most Zionists. (And I recommend that you not call yourself \"anti-Zionist\" because that makes it very difficult to build political coalitions with Jews in Israel to change Israeli state policies.)\n\nI've only ever seen two theoretical justifications for actual, ideological anti-Zionism, i.e. the belief that the Jewish people are not entitled to a nation-state:\n\n1. The antisemitic position: Jews are uniquely not entitled to a nation-state. This is often done in one of two ways. By erasing Jewish history and identity to claim that Jews are only a religion and not a nation, or by accepting Jewish national identity while applying an unjustifiable double standard. All unjustified double standards are bigoted.\n\n2. The anarchist position: nation-states are all bad and no people are entitled to them. I disagree with the anarchist position, but applying the same political schema to everyone is never bigoted.\n\nAgain, and this is very important: criticizing Israel for doing any specific thing is not anti-Zionism or antisemitism. Condemning Israel because it exists at all, or demanding that it cease to exist entirely within any borders, is anti-Zionism - and often, but not necessarily, antisemitism.\n\nI can elaborate on any of this, but I think I've written enough for now haha", "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "date_year_month": "2018-06", "created_utc_converted": "2018-06-13 15:12:16", "score_overall": 30, "words": "holocaust conspiracy holocaust jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jew jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish holocaust jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish", "shared_words": "holocaust conspiracy jewish jew", "socre_distint": 4}

{"archived": false, "author": "charmed_im-sure", "body": "The Ten Stages of Genocide\n\n1 - Classification: All cultures have categories to distinguish people into \u201cus and them\u201d by ethnicity, race, religion, or nationality: German and Jew, Hutu and Tutsi. Bipolar societies that lack mixed categories are the most likely to have genocide. The main preventive measure at this early stage is to develop universalistic institutions that transcend ethnic or racial divisions, that actively promote tolerance and understanding, and that promote classifications that transcend the divisions. \n\n2 - Symbolization: We give names or other symbols to the classifications. We name people \u201cJews\u201d or \u201cGypsies,\u201d or distinguish them by colors or dress; and apply the symbols to members of groups. Classification and symbolization are universally human and do not necessarily result in genocide unless they lead to dehumanization. When combined with hatred, symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of pariah groups. \n\n3 - Discrmination: A dominant group uses law, custom, and political power to deny the rights of other groups. The powerless group may not be accorded full civil rights, voting rights, or even citizenship. The dominant group is driven by an exclusionary ideology that would deprive less powerful groups of their rights. The ideology advocates monopolization or expansion of power by the dominant group. It legitimizes the victimization of weaker groups. Advocates of exclusionary ideologies are often charismatic, expressing resentments of their followers, attracting support from the masses. \n\n4 - Dehumanization: One group denies the humanity of the other group. Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects or diseases. Dehumanization overcomes the normal human revulsion against murder. At this stage, hate propaganda in print and on hate radios is used to vilify the victim group. The majority group is taught to regard the other group as less than human, and even alien to their society. They are indoctrinated to believe that \u201cWe are better off without them.\u201d The powerless group can become so depersonalized that they are actually given numbers rather than names, as Jews were in the death camps. They are equated with filth, impurity, and immorality. Hate speech fills the propaganda of official radio, newspapers, and speeches.\n\n5 - Organization: Genocide is always organized, usually by the state, often using militias to provide deniability of state responsibility. (An example is the Sudanese government\u2019s support and arming of the Janjaweed in Darfur.) Sometimes organization is informal (Hindu mobs led by local RSS militants during Indian partition) or decentralized (jihadist terrorist groups.) Special army units or militias are often trained and armed. Arms are purchased by states and militias, often in violation of UN Arms Embargos, to facilitate acts of genocide. States organize secret police to spy on, arrest, torture, and murder people suspected of opposition to political leaders. Special training is given to murderous militias and special army killing units.\n\n6 - Polarization: Extremists drive the groups apart. Hate groups broadcast polarizing propaganda. Motivations for targeting a group are indoctrinated through mass media. Laws may forbid intermarriage or social interaction. Extremist terrorism targets moderates, intimidating and silencing the center. Moderates from the perpetrators\u2019 own group are most able to stop genocide, so are the first to be arrested and killed. Leaders in targeted groups are the next to be arrested and murdered. The dominant group passes emergency laws or decrees that grants them total power over the targeted group. The laws erode fundamental civil rights and liberties. Targeted groups are disarmed to make them incapable of self-defense, and to ensure that the dominant group has total control.\n\n7 - Preparation: Plans are made for genocidal killings. National or perpetrator group leaders plan the \u201cFinal Solution\u201d to the Jewish, Armenian, Tutsi or other targeted group \u201cquestion.\u201d They often use euphemisms to cloak their intentions, such as referring to their goals as \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d \u201cpurification,\u201d or \u201ccounter-terrorism.\u201d They build armies, buy weapons and train their troops and militias. They indoctrinate the populace with fear of the victim group. Leaders often claim that \u201cif we don\u2019t kill them, they will kill us,\u201d disguising genocide as self-defense. Acts of genocide are disguised as counter-insurgency if there is an ongoing armed conflict or civil war. There is a sudden increase in inflammatory rhetoric and hate propaganda with the objective of creating fear of the other group. Political processes such as peace accords that threaten the total dominance of the genocidal group or upcoming elections that may cost them their grip on total power may actually trigger genocide.\n\nPrevention of preparation may include arms embargoes and commissions to enforce them. It should include prosecution of **incitement and conspiracy to commit genocide, both crimes under Article 3 of the Genocide Convention**.\n\n8 - Persecution: Victims are identified and separated out because of their ethnic or religious identity. Death lists are drawn up. In state sponsored genocide, members of victim groups may be forced to wear identifying symbols. Their property is often expropriated. Sometimes they are even segregated into ghettoes, deported into concentration camps, or confined to a famine-struck region and starved. They are deliberately deprived of resources such as water or food in order to slowly destroy them. Programs are implemented to prevent procreation through forced sterilization or abortions. **Children are forcibly taken from their parents.**  The victim group\u2019s basic human rights become systematically abused through extrajudicial killings, torture and forced displacement.  Genocidal massacres begin. They are acts of genocide because they intentionally destroy part of a group. The perpetrators watch for whether such massacres meet any international reaction. If not, they realize that that the international community will again be bystanders and permit another genocide. \n     \nAt this stage, a Genocide Emergency must be declared. If the political will of the great powers, regional alliances, or U.N. Security Council or the U.N. General Assembly can be mobilized, armed international intervention should be prepared, or heavy assistance provided to the victim group to prepare for its self-defense. \n\n9 - Extermination: begins, and quickly becomes the mass killing legally called \u201cgenocide.\u201d It is \u201cextermination\u201d to the killers because they do not believe their victims to be fully human. When it is sponsored by the state, the armed forces often work with militias to do the killing. Sometimes the genocide results in revenge killings by groups against each other, creating the downward whirlpool-like cycle of bilateral genocide. \n \n10 - Denial: is the final stage that lasts throughout and always follows genocide. It is among the surest indicators of further genocidal massacres. The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves, burn the bodies, try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses. They deny that they committed any crimes, and often blame what happened on the victims. They block investigations of the crimes, and continue to govern until driven from power by force, when they flee into exile. There they remain with impunity, like Pol Pot or Idi Amin, unless they are captured and a tribunal is established to try them.\n\nref: http://genocidewatch.net/genocide-2/8-stages-of-genocide/", "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 5, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "politics", "date_year_month": "2018-06", "created_utc_converted": "2018-06-17 13:21:47", "score_overall": 4, "words": "jew silencing jewish conspiracy", "shared_words": "jew silencing jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}
{"archived": false, "author": "kieslowskifan", "body": "Modified from [an earlier answer of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3qu8ma/how_did_propaganda_change_in_nazi_germany_after/) \n\n&gt; Enjoy the war, for the peace is going to be terrible- popular German joke in the last year of the war\n\nAs the fortunes of war turned against Germany after the Battle of Stalingrad, German propaganda found an imperative need to readjust to this new reality. Prior to the military reversals of 1942, German propaganda had operated on the principle of presenting an \"ersatz reality,\" wherein the state-dominated media maximized Germany's victories and ignored the salient truth that Germany's war was not a short one and her enemies persisted in fighting Germany. The scale of defeats like Stalingrad, the growing Allied bomber raids, and the surrender of German forces in North Africa pricked this media bubble and German propaganda organs responded accordingly. \n\nThis retooling of the Third Reich's propaganda apparatus in light of defeat pursued several seemingly counter-intuitive strategies. For one thing, despite the fact that the Third Reich was a personalist dictatorship *par excellence*, the figure of Hitler disappeared from German propaganda. In contrast to propaganda from the earlier years of victory, post-Stalingrad news of German military operations seldom invoked Hitler's name or connected him too heavily to military operations. This was part of a deliberate strategy on Goebbels's part as he recognized connecting Hitler too intimately to Germany's military fortunes made him, and by extension, the legitimacy of the entire regime, culpable when these operations did not bear fruit. Rather than present images of the F\u00fchrer, Hitler was  invoked in late war propaganda as an abstract figure that stood for all Germans. This could just be from invoking his title, or oblique historical analogies such as films that made apparent the connection between Hitler and historical personages like Frederick the Great. Hitler, whose visage was omnipresent in state propaganda between 1933-1941, became an abstraction. By the same token, German propaganda also emphasized the severity and violence of German military setbacks, but with a unique spin. Allied bombing, the Soviet massacres of Polish officers at Katyn, and other actions of the Allies became staples of German propaganda after the tide had turned as it showed that Germany's enemies were merciless. The idea behind this emphasis upon the Allies' purported barbarity was to bind the Germans together through a policy of \"strength through terror.\" This dehumanization of the Allies' military underscored that no compromise was possible and this was a war in which there was to be no quarter given and none expected.  \n\nThese new strategies often dovetailed with established propaganda discourses that had been present within the Third Reich since 1933. The regime's castigation of the so-called \"November Criminals\" of 1918 also found new currency in this environment. Interrogations of German troops captured after 20 July 1944 often reported back that one key motivation for fighting on was to prevent a repeat of Germany's humiliating defeat at the end of the First World War.  One important component of the demonization of the Allied military was that German retribution was in the making. Since 1933, one of the central legitimizing planks of the NSDAP was that it had enabled German technology and genius to reach its full potential. The vaunted V-weapons tapped into this established narrative that German technical expertise brooked no rivals. But beyond rockets and other *Wunderwaffen*, National Socialism had always stressed the ability of the will to transcend any material obstacles. This propaganda's emphasis upon collective action in the face of numerical superiority fed into this notion that the will is superior to rational logic. Similarly, the destruction of German landmarks and the seemingly indiscriminate nature of Allied bombing heightened the sense that this was a cultural war and that the Germanic culture constantly trumpeted by the Third Reich was in existential danger. \n\nOne sinister aspect of the late war propaganda was its turn to a heightened antisemitism. Goebbels used the solidarity of Allied coalition of both the imperial Britain, hypercapitalist United States, and the Bolshevik USSR as evidence of grand global Jewish conspiracy against Germany. Victor Klemperer, a German Jew who by fortune escaped deportation and murder, would note in his diaries the increasingly shrill antisemitism in propaganda as Germany's fortunes waned. The widespread knowledge about the Holocaust amongst the German public imparted a weight to this propaganda that it might not have otherwise possessed. Although they might not have known the specifics of the Holocaust, most Germans were aware that something quite terrible had happened to the Jews in the East. Even though the antisemitism was troweled on so thick to strain credibility in this propaganda, it encouraged the expectation that the Allies would hold Germany collectively responsible  for the mass murder of the Jews. This does not mean that the German public accepted the NSDAP and Propaganda Ministry's antisemitism wholesale, but in some cases interpreted antisemitism quite differently than the state. One popular rumor among German civilians in 1943/4 was that Hungary had not been the target of any Allied  bombings was because the Hungarian government had spared its Jews. The SD recorded a number of complaints that because the Horthy government has ghettoized Jews in Budapest the Allies would not attack this human shield, and there was grumbling within the German populace that Hitler did not do the same for cities like Berlin or Hamburg. And some of this disgruntlement was not clandestine, but took the form of direct petitions to Goebbels. There were a string of letters to the Propaganda Ministry after the mass operations to clear Hungary's Jews in 1944 demanding that they be used as human hostages against Allied bombing. But the general acceptance of some of the antisemitism produced by Goebbels's machine precluded any thought or possibility of a negotiated peace for much of the German public. News of the Morgenthau Plan, which would have deindustrialized Germany, the expansion of Allied bombing, and the scale of German reverses fostered the expectation of a Carthaginian peace.   \n\nThe effectiveness of this late-war propaganda is open to interpretation. While it could not rekindle hope in final victory, it did strengthen the resolve of some Germans to see the war to its bitter conclusion. Yet, even as propaganda turned to negative integration (uniting around a threat), it could not arrest the gradual estrangement of much of the German public to the National Socialist state. Goebbels himself appreciated this sentiment and his famous  February 1943 *Sportpalast* speech had veiled threats against the \"Golden Pheasants\" of the NSDAP who were thus far still enjoying a prewar lifestyle.  This late-war propaganda often worked in conjunction with greater arbitrary state violence directed against Germans, especially after the 20 July plot. Extralegal state violence had been embedded in the DNA of the Third Reich since 1933, but outside of political enemies and German Jews, most Germans' interaction with arbitrary state violence was the *threat* of it until around Stalingrad, when the security services began a much more thorough crackdown against shirkers and potential fifth-columnists. The 20 July plot helped to further this turn towards extralegal violence and other forms of domestic terror. \n\nMost Germans would have been obviously aware that the war had been going poorly by 1943. Analysis of letters sent back home as well as SD reports show a drop in expectations of victory. There were simply too many salient reverses to ignore. The Allied bomber campaign against the Ruhr and the sound of flak would have been something impossible to ignore. The government itself publicized some of the Allied victories as an example that Germany's back was against the wall. Goebbels and other media arms would try and manage news of defeats such as framing retreats as tactical withdrawals. Other mass surrenders like Stalingrad and Tunisia were framed as modern day sacrifice in the vein of Leonidas and the 300 Spartans. This spin-doctoring of defeat became so ubiquitous that one grim homefront joke was \"what sound does a clock make when it goes forwards? *Tick-~~tock~~tack*. When it goes backwards? *Tak-tik*.\" By the the winter of 1944, the Red Army had begun to occupy German territory in the East (both in the Reich and those annexed in 1939) and Goebbels's propaganda ministry published lurid atrocity tales. Moreover, the advance of Anglo-American arms across France had eliminated what had been Hitler's greatest strategic victory in 1940. The retreat of German troops as well as the fall of the German city of Aachen in October 1944 would have been a reality that would have been difficult to ignore. \n\nThe mid- and late-war propaganda drive for mass action and a collective response to Allied aggression worked in often counterintuitive ways. While it stiffened resolve to not have a repeat of November 1918, propaganda along with the deteriorating war effort engendered a kind of grim fatalism for the future. Both rhetoric and reality heightened the sense of social anomie and the breakdown of society that came as bombing and wartime pressures destroyed the German infrastructure and stretched the civilian domestic economy well past its breaking point. The final agonies of the last few months of the war, as well as the violence meted out to Germans that shirked in their duties, helped to cement the postwar myth that Germans were double victims of the war- who were both subject to extreme violence from their military enemies, but also brutalized by a hypocritical criminal regime.  \n\n", "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 11, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "date_year_month": "2018-06", "created_utc_converted": "2018-06-17 14:34:52", "score_overall": 5, "words": "jewish conspiracy jew holocaust holocaust", "shared_words": "jewish conspiracy jew holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}

Bipolar societies that lack mixed categories are the most likely to have genocide. The main preventive measure at this early stage is to develop universalistic institutions that transcend ethnic or racial divisions, that actively promote tolerance and understanding, and that promote classifications that transcend the divisions.\n\n2 - Symbolization: We give names or other symbols to the classifications. We name people \u201cJews\u201d or \u201cGypsies,\u201d or distinguish them by colors or dress; and apply the symbols to members of groups. Classification and symbolization are universally human and do not necessarily result in genocide unless they lead to dehumanization. When combined with hatred, symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of pariah groups.\n\n3 - Discrmination: A dominant group uses law, custom, and political power to deny the rights of other groups. The powerless group may not be accorded full civil rights, voting rights, or even citizenship. The dominant group is driven by an exclusionary ideology that would deprive less powerful groups of their rights. The ideology advocates monopolization or expansion of power by the dominant group. It legitimizes the victimization of weaker groups. Advocates of exclusionary ideologies are often charismatic, expressing resentments of their followers, attracting support from the masses.\n\n4 - Dehumanization: One group denies the humanity of the other group. Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects or diseases. Dehumanization overcomes the normal human revulsion against murder. At this stage, hate propaganda in print and on hate radios is used to vilify the victim group. The majority group is taught to regard the other group as less than human, and even alien to their society. They are indoctrinated to believe that \u201cWe are better off without them.\u201d The powerless group can become so depersonalized that they are actually given numbers rather than names, as Jews were in the death camps. They are equated with filth, impurity, and immorality. Hate speech fills the propaganda of official radio, newspapers, and speeches.\n\n5 - Organization: Genocide is always organized, usually by the state, often using militias to provide deniability of state responsibility. (An example is the Sudanese government\u2019s support and arming of the Janjaweed in Darfur.) Sometimes organization is informal (Hindu mobs led by local RSS militants during Indian partition) or decentralized (jihadist terrorist groups.) Special army units or militias are often trained and armed. Arms are purchased by states and militias, often in violation of UN Arms Embargos, to facilitate acts of genocide. States organize secret police to spy on, arrest, torture, and murder people suspected of opposition to political leaders. Special training is given to murderous militias and special army killing units.\n\n6 - Polarization: Extremists drive the groups apart. Hate groups broadcast polarizing propaganda. Motivations for targeting a group are indoctrinated through mass media. Laws may forbid intermarriage or social interaction. Extremist terrorism targets moderates, intimidating and silencing the center. Moderates from the perpetrators\u2019 own group are most able to stop genocide, so are the first to be arrested and killed. Leaders in targeted groups are the next to be arrested and murdered. The dominant group passes emergency laws or decrees that grants them total power over the targeted group. The laws erode fundamental civil rights and liberties. Targeted groups are disarmed to make them incapable of self-defense, and to ensure that the dominant group has total control.\n\n7 - Preparation: Plans are made for genocidal killings. National or perpetrator group leaders plan the \u201cFinal Solution\u201d to the Jewish, Armenian, Tutsi or other targeted group \u201cquestion.\u201d They often use euphemisms to cloak their intentions, such as referring to their goals as \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d \u201cpurification,\u201d or \u201ccounter-terrorism.\u201d They build armies, buy weapons and train their troops and militias. They indoctrinate the populace with fear of the victim group. Leaders often claim that \u201cif we don\u2019t kill them, they will kill us,\u201d disguising genocide as self-defense. Acts of genocide are disguised as counter-insurgency if there is an ongoing armed conflict or civil war. There is a sudden increase in inflammatory rhetoric and hate propaganda with the objective of creating fear of the other group. Political processes such as peace accords that threaten the total dominance of the genocidal group or upcoming elections that may cost them their grip on total power may actually trigger genocide.\n\nPrevention of preparation may include arms embargoes and commissions to enforce them. It should include prosecution of incitement and conspiracy to commit genocide, both crimes under Article 3 of the Genocide Convention.\n\n8 - Persecution: Victims are identified and separated out because of their ethnic or religious identity. Death lists are drawn up. In state sponsored genocide, members of victim groups may be forced to wear identifying symbols. Their property is often expropriated. Sometimes they are even segregated into ghettoes, deported into concentration camps, or confined to a famine-struck region and starved. They are deliberately deprived of resources such as water or food in order to slowly destroy them. Programs are implemented to prevent procreation through forced sterilization or abortions. Children are forcibly taken from their parents. The victim group\u2019s basic human rights become systematically abused through extrajudicial killings, torture and forced displacement. Genocidal massacres begin. They are acts of genocide because they intentionally destroy part of a group. The perpetrators watch for whether such massacres meet any international reaction. If not, they realize that that the international community will again be bystanders and permit another genocide.\n\nAt this stage, a Genocide Emergency must be declared. If the political will of the great powers, regional alliances, or U.N. Security Council or the U.N. General Assembly can be mobilized, armed international intervention should be prepared, or heavy assistance provided to the victim group to prepare for its self-defense.\n\n9 - Extermination: begins, and quickly becomes the mass killing legally called \u201cgenocide.\u201d It is \u201cextermination\u201d to the killers because they do not believe their victims to be fully human. When it is sponsored by the state, the armed forces often work with militias to do the killing. Sometimes the genocide results in revenge killings by groups against each other, creating the downward whirlpool-like cycle of bilateral genocide.\n\n10 - Denial: is the final stage that lasts throughout and always follows genocide. It is among the surest indicators of further genocidal massacres. The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves, burn the bodies, try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses. They deny that they committed any crimes, and often blame what happened on the victims. They block investigations of the crimes, and continue to govern until driven from power by force, when they flee into exile. There they remain with impunity, like Pol Pot or Idi Amin, unless they are captured and a tribunal is established to try them.\n\nref: http://genocidewatch.net/genocide-2/8-stages-of-genocide/", "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "politics", "date_year_month": "2018-06", "created_utc_converted": "2018-06-17 14:35:50", "score_overall": 4, "words": "jew silencing jewish conspiracy", "shared_words": "jew silencing jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

{"archived": false, "author": "CrazyWhole", "body": "&gt;It seems like Jews enjoy all the same privilege and power as other white  people, but with widespread protection from both the right and left  even when they are participating in the same racist and entitled  behavior that white people sometimes do.\n\nHmmm. You are accusing Jews of participating in racist behavior but getting a pass because they are Jews. This is a serious accusation that requires serious proof. All I see in the OP is this:\n\n&gt;The high level of diversity in that one segregated area is used by our  local representatives to receive government funding for projects where  all the white/Jewish people live, but none are ever done in the  immigrant heavy area.\n\nWhat does this mean? The Jews live in the community, but one specific low income area is not well-maintained? How is this at all related to the Jews? Low income areas tend to have crappier everything. I'm not sure why you think that the Jews are controlling the flow of money because they are Jews. Maybe they vote more, campaign, participate in government, and thus have a say in the allocation of funds. Are the immigrants even citizens?  If not, they cannot vote. Do they own the homes? If not, then the crazy high property taxes are directly affecting the homeowners, who are passing it on to tenants. Who owns the homes?\n\nWithout some specific details about the \"government funding for projects,\" how that money is obtained, how it benefits Jews specifically, etc., this is just an amorphous anecdote that doesn't convince me of anything.\n\nCould you give some details or specific instances (not anecdotal, some actual legal or otherwise empirical) where Jews benefit from widespread protection? Also, is there some specific racist and entitled behavior that you can point to Jews as a group committing in the United States that they are given a pass on because they are Jews? I would like links to reputable media outlets, not just stories.\n\n&gt;But I think the American stance on the holocaust was clear. We hate Nazis and all they represent.\n\nThey marched in Charlottesville and the president of the United States refused to condemn them. It's not as clear as it should be.\n\n&gt;From what I\u2019ve seen those that actually wish the Jewish people harm are a  tiny, tiny minority vigorously opposed by the rest of our culture.\n\nI wish you knew how many times I've heard people blame all sorts of global wrongs on Jewish banking conspiracies. The Rothschild thing is particularly virulent and persistent. Stuff like that, and frankly your vague allusions to Jews funneling government money into their own \"projects\" sounds like bogeyman grumblings around Jews and money that never seem to go away.\n\n&gt;The rest of us seem scared to criticize Jews (for participating in  things like I described above) for fear of being labeled an anti-Semite\n\nThe sad thing is, when you talk about Jews getting money they don't deserve, chiseling it out of the government via manipulation, it sounds all kinds of alarm bells because that sort of talk has preceded every pogrom, inquisition, purge, etc. \"The Jews are messing with our economy\" is the go-to argument for having anti-Jewish feelings and taking anti-Jewish actions. I would imprecate you to think really hard about why you are attributing what is going on in your neighborhood to Jewishness and not politics as usual, which happens everywhere. Snapping to \"it's because they are Jews!\" scares the shit out of Jews, for good reason. It's not like the Holocaust happened a long time ago. It's not like history isn't full of examples of people being pissed off at Jews for having money, then deciding that anger warrants action against Jews as a group.\n\n&gt;If there is a stigma for being Jewish it\u2019s primarily about being rich and profiting off of other groups\n\nThe stigma is being **falsely accused** of profiting and being hated because they are \"rich,\" as if they didn't work hard and earn their money but somehow do some sort of Jewish chicanery to get that moeny. [There is a link between religion and wealth, but only because certain religions have higher educational attainment.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/11/how-income-varies-among-u-s-religious-groups/) It's not Jewish banking conspiracies or Jews infiltrating and corrupting government. Jews culturally prioritize education because the religion is heavily based on reading, analyzing, and debating the meaning of books. High value is placed on literacy and educational success. It's not a conspiracy. It's a work ethic that is culturally reinforced.\n\n&gt;And there is some legitimate truth to both that warrants honest discussion\n\nThis is an allegation that you are really going to have to prove with empirical data. Please give examples of how Jews as a group (not individual Jews acting on their own behalf) \"profit off other groups.\" Or how the Jews who are wealthy come by their wealth in a way that is particular to their Jewishness, and somehow worthy of Jewish-related criticism. You may have a problem with how someone came by their money, especially if it is illegal or unethical. When you then go to, \"Annnnnd he's a Jew, too!\" then you are engaging in anti-Semitism, because being a Jew has nothing inherently to do with being good at banking, or diamond trading, or whatever. That is a stereotype that blows a dog whistle that has led to really horrible things happening to Jews, over and over.\n\nIt's late, but if you need examples of people deciding to hurt Jews because of trumped up claims of ill-gotten wealth, I can provide them at great length. First, I'd like to see your evidence of a connection between Jewishness, being allowed to be racist and not being called on it for being a Jew, or Jews acting in concert with other Jews to take advantage of other groups, then getting away with it because they are Jews. Those are serious claims and require serious proof.\n\nAdded just for fun: [Harvard, for example, placed a quota on the number of Jews it would accept because too many Jews were getting into Harvard](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-ivy-leagues-history-of-discriminating-against-jews-2014-12).

The Church wouldn't allow Christians to lend money and charge interest, but Jews could. This led to a wierd love-hate.. Leaders loved Jews in their countries, but as soon as it came time to pay their interest on loans, suddenly they'd rid their country of them. It's the origins of the 'greedy Jew' stereotypes.

Chesterton, The Crank (1934)\n\n&gt;Nor have the Jews a worse enemy than the sort of Jew sceptic who sometimes tries to explain himself away. I have seen a whole book full of alternative theories of the particular historic cause of such a delusion about a difference; that it came from mediaeval priests or was burnt into us by the Inquisition; that it was a tribal theory arising out of Teutonism; that it was revolutionary envy of the few Jews who happened to be the big bankers of Capitalism; that it was Capitalist resistance to the few Jews who happened to be the chief founders of Communism. All these separate theories are false in separate ways; as in forgetting that mediaeval heresy hunts spared Jews more and not less than Christians; or that Capitalism and Communism are so very nearly the same thing, in ethical essence, that it would not be strange if they did take leaders from the same ethnological elements. But broadly, the evasions are contrary to common sense; as they were contrary even to the common sense of a boy of thirteen. I do not believe that a crowd on a race-course is poisoned by mediaeval theology; or the navvies in a Mile End pub misled by the ethnology of Gobineau or Max M\u00fcller; nor do I believe that a mob of little boys fresh from the cricket-field or the tuckshop were troubled about Marxian economics or international finance. Yet all these people recognise Jews as Jews when they see them; and the schoolboys recognised them, not with any great hostility except in patches; but with the integration of instinct.  What they saw was not Semites or Schismatics or capitalists or revolutionists, but foreigners; only foreigners that were not called foreigners.

And yet, I can certainly imagine that because of my association with Chesterton, there are people who probbly suspect that I am anti-Semitic. When I say I can imagine it, I mean that I really cannot imagine it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(...)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Chesterton\u2019s ideas about the Jews were consistent from beginning to end.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(...)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He was famous for having no enemies, for never attacking anyone personally but for attacking only ideas.

I write more about this [in this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5zetxi/how_did_holocaust_survivors_survive/) but to directly cite Grossmann:\n\n&gt; This forced migration away from the Soviet territories first attacked by the Germans therefore provided\u2014and I keep repeating this fact because it still seems alien to the dominant narrative\u2014the main chance for eastern European Jewry\u2019s survival. The so-called Asiatics who survived the extreme hardships of the Soviet \u201crefuge\u201d constituted the numerical, if not the most visible or articulate, core of the She\u2019erit Hapleta (the core of Eastern European survivors of the Holocaust) Yet we know remarkably little about these Jews\u2019 everyday life, about the political decisions and wartime contingencies that determined their fate, about their numbers, about the relations between Jewish and non-Jewish Polish refugees, about relations with Soviet citizens, Jewish and not. It is astonishing.\n\nAnyways, on to Lithuania.\n\nScholarship on the issue has identified several factors that played a major role in Lithuania having its Jewish community so thoroughly annihilated and becoming the first European territory to be declared \"Jew-free\". One of these factors was that it served in the words of historian Konrad Kwiet a \"rehearsal stage\" and Nazi case study for how the Holocaust in the Soviet Union and more specifically the Einsatzgruppen operated. Secondly, and in contrast to other territories of the Soviet Union and Poland, the Jewish community in Lithuania was highly concentrated in the urban centers and at the same time, easy to identify and isolated from the majority population (I will get to that); and thirdly, a history of organized political anti-Semitism dating back to the inter-war period, that the Germans were able to activate and use for their purposes in order to make use of a relatively small portion of Lithuanian society serving as very active collaborators.\n\nAs Michael MacQueen writes in his article *The Context of Mass Destruction: Agents and Prerequisites of the Holocaust in Lithuania*:\n\n&gt; [T]hree themes are central to our understanding of how the Lithuanian Holocaust happened: (1) the nature of Lithuanian nationalism and its setting; (2) the political context of the late interwar and early war years (i.e. spring 1938-June 1941); and (3) the notion of the complete disruption, perhaps more accurately atomization, of Lithuanian society in the period in question. Although this atomization requires additional research, it appears to have provided a prime element of the setting for mass murder. Antisemitism in Lithuania, especially the violent forms it took during the Holocaust, derived impetus from all three of these elements.\n\nConcerning Lithuanian nationalism, there are several developments that kicked off in the 19th century that are fairly typical for the development of nationalism overall. Once a nation has been \"invented\", so to speak, it will in the minds and arguments of its nationalists, have already existed for a long time. History is always a prime method of legitimizing nationalist positions and aspirations and in Lithuania the history that was rather obvious to serve as this backdrop was that of the Lithuanian Grand Duchy and the subsequent Lithuanian-Polish commonwealth. However, in terms of Lithuanian nationalist policies of the 19th century the Commonwealth was viewed rather negatively. MacQueen cites a Lithuanian historian who describes it as \"disastrous to the Lithuanian people and state: the union opened wide the doors for the influence of western Polish culture and the anarchy that accompanied it\". The end of the Commonwealth with the partition of Poland spelled \u2013 to them \u2013 a disastrous end to Lithuanian identity and politics that needed to be re-asserted in opposition to Polish and other foreign culture. They blamed the decline of Lithuania from the greatness of the Grand Duchy to an alleged illiterate peasant people on the Poles. Alleged \"polonization\" and the link of Lithuania's fate to the Polish pursuit of revolutionary goals had ended,in their interpretations, in the near eradication of Lithuania during the repressions and Russification that followed the abortive nineteenth-century Polish-led uprisings. Lithuanian nationalists came to regard the smothering power of Polish culture in its historical perspective as the engine which had denationalized the local elite and caused it to identify with a nation other than that from which it had originated. This became especially pertinent in the aftermath of WWI when the newly created Polish Republic seized Vilnius in 1920, which the Lithuanians claimed as the capital of their state.\n\nEnter the Jewish community of Lithuania \u2013 or rather, Russian imperial policies regarding the Jewish community. The very short version of the background here is that after attempts to either convert Jews or drive them out of the country, Tsarist Russia in 1791 created the so-called \"Pale of Settlement\", a territory in the West of Russia which was the only territory Jews were allowed to reside in. The Pale did include parts of Lithuania and in the 100+ years it existed fostered a particular Eastern European Jewish culture that differed from Western Europe in as far as assimilation of Jews into the majority society was something that started comparatively late and was more difficult due to several cultural and political obstacles.\n\nThe most notable of the obstacles in the Lithuanian case was language. To speak Lithuanian became \u2013 as was the case in other developments of nationalism \u2013 the prime signifier of allegiance to the Lithuanian nation and people. Jews on the other hand, who had been forced to live in shtetls (almost exclusively Jewish villages) or ghettos in the major imperial cities, did not speak Lithuanian en large. Their primary language was Yiddish and their secondary languages Polish and Russian. Lithuanian had until the Independence of Lithuania not been the language of power and administration nor the lingua franca of the territory. This is an important detail in as far as to both nationalist Lithuanians and political active Jews in Lithuania, the fact that the Jews did not speak Lithuanian made a mutual understanding as Lithuanians not really possible.\n\nThis perceived lack of identity between the Jewish and Lithuanian national interests created tensions that were compounded by traditional and newly formed forms of Antisemitism in the inter-war period. Next to \"traditional\" forms of Antisemitism such as clerical (Christ killers) and economic (money lenders), the spread of the idea of Jewish-Bolshevism was a most important element. The idea of the Jewish international conspiracy was one that was highly popular in Tsarist Russia (see f.ex. the Protocolls of the Elders of Zion) and that with the Russian Civil War of 1917-1922 morphed into the idea of Bolshevism being a forced controlled by said Jewish conspiracy. Many national movements, including that in Lithuania, saw Jews as \"anti-national\" and agents and executioners of the Bolshevik policies.\n\nThese issues were further compounded by the development of political culture in inter-war Lithuania, starting with Antanas Smetona's 1926 coup d'etat. Smetona had already served as the first president of Lithuania after independence and was a highly prominent figure in Lithuanian nationalism. Enveloped in anti-Polish irredentism and revanchism, he and Augustinas Voldemaras \u2013 another prominent Lithuanian nationalist \u2013 supported a military coup against a more left leaning government and installed themselves as president and prime minister respectively. Over subsequent years of Smetona's rule Lithuanian political culture took a noticeable turn to the right, including becoming very hostile towards Jewish and Polish minorities and prevalence of organized political violence, especially in from of the Voldemarist Iron Wolf movement, which was founded after Voldemaras was removed from power in 1929.\n\nAlready enveloped in these trends, the political crisis of 1938-1941 further worsened the atomization of Lithuanian society. In 1938 Poland forced Lithuania under threat of war to recognize their sovereignty over Vilnius. In 1939 Germany forced the retrocession of Memel/Klajpeda, adding to the profound sense of national demoralization. In the same year, the Soviets offered to station troops in Lithuania to \"protect\" it from further incursions; a pretext that lead to the occupation and annexation of Lithuania by the USSR in 1940.\n", "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 81, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "date_year_month": "2018-06", "created_utc_converted": "2018-06-25 10:26:12", "score_overall": 22, "words": "holocaust jewish jewish jewish jewish jew holocaust jewish holocaust holocaust holocaust jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish conspiracy jewish conspiracy jewish", "shared_words": "holocaust jewish jew conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

{"archived": false, "author": "SheepwithShovels", "body": "&gt;For the International Jew, it is. There has been a strange fusion which took place in the elite, which is a mixture of Neo-Liberal, Neo-Conservative, Internationalist-Capitalist, mabe even Socialism, depending on the definition, with technocrats.\n&gt;Like said, just straight Internationalism. The Jew plays both sides.\n\nIt sounds like you're looking at everyone you oppose, noticing that there are Jews involved, and then painting them as a single, unified enemy-the international Jew. Yes, Jews played important roles in the movements you mention. So did a lot of white Gentiles. Saying that the Jew plays both sides implies that Jews are consciously organizing to do this or that. What makes you think that \"the international Jew\" is conspiring to eliminate the white race? Isn't it more likely that most of the culprits are extremely wealthy individuals just trying to make as much money as possible? \n\n&gt;Gee, that sounds alot like Jews : ^ ) Especially when Stalin called them that when he was expelling them from his Administration in the 50's lmao.\n\nHa, well, you do have a pint there. I've been concerned before about the possibility of professors mistaking my criticisms of nihilism and the post-industrial bourgeoisie for antisemitism but I think all of them understood what I was saying. I am genuinely criticizing those things, not using them as a codeword or proxy for Jews. \n\n&gt;It was rather 2+ other quotes, one calling goys cattle and animals and another saying that jews will get 2800 slaves when the messiah comes, the slaves will obviously be goy. If you want the source, i'll dm because there's a lot of quotes.\n\nI wouldn't be shocked if this is true since most religious texts have some pretty wacky stuff in them but I'd still appreciate a source. You don't have to send me the whole passages. Just tell me where it's located and I'll look it up. \nEven if it is in there, that doesn't necessarily mean all or even most religious Jews believe that. Most Christians don't believe in or aren't aware of significant portions of the Bible. \n\n&gt;But yeah, I agree the non religious ones are more to blame compared to the religious, although I still see them as equal to blame. I used the talmud passage as a way to show how jews view gentiles, as lower than them.\n\nAll of the Jews I've met have been good people. I haven't discussed the topic of race with all of them but most have explicitly identified or said things which imply they identify as white and I've never heard any of them say anything about viewing goyim as inferior. You could say that they just keep those views to themselves because they know I'm not Jewish but I find that extremely hard to believe. I know this is purely anecdotal so it might not mean much to you but I don't know of any surveys done on whether or not Jews consider themselves superior to Gentiles lol.\n\n&gt;((((((Franz Boas)))))) and his Boasian school dominated academia, entire boards, made it possible to do away with racial explanations for human social differences, criticizes European society.\n\nBoas didn't completely reject the existence of all biological differences, did he? He was a cultural relativist, emphasized the importance of environmental factors on behavior and development, and rejected the idea that some races are superior to others. Didn't he still consider races to be legitimate biological categories to place human groups into though? I thought that was something which some of his successors criticize him for. I could be wrong. I'm far from an expert on the guy. Today, most anthropologists agree that he overstated the impact of environmental factors on things like skull shape but commend him for his refutations of the pseudo-scientific racism of his era. Some criticisms of European society are perfectly fine. You and I are both critical of the rampant consumerism present in European society. Likewise, pointing out the flaws in pseudo-science believed by some whtes is also a valid criticism. \n\n&gt;Jews were very heavily into leftist politics, played a critical hand in the spread of it. This wasn't just a movement for them to attack capitalists, but to alter European society altogether in their vision.\n\nWell, if your people have a long history of oppression, it makes sense that you'd be attracted to egalitarian movements. There have been a number of anti-egalitarian Jews though, even fascist ones.\n\n&gt;Then there's immigration, jews love it for us, but hate when it's them.\n\nI think part of the problem here stems from grouping together progressive and Zionist Jews. Occasionally, you will find an overlap. Chuck Schumer is a good example of this. He would be horrified by a Republican talking about America the way he talks about Israel. This is hypocritical. However, most progressive Jews are also opposed to the actions of Israel, especially radical leftists like Noam Chomsky and Judith Butler. There are also a number of Zionists who are supportive of nationalist movements in predominantly white countries. Soros, a man who has become a symbol of international Jewish power for many on the far-right, is not an ally of Israel. Most of the hypocrisy you see is a result of viewing Jews as monolithic. \n\n&gt;Jews push and thrive in a \"pluralistic\" society, because they see a homogeneous european population as a threat to them, because \"anti-semitism\".\n\nI would never deny that there are some Jews who think this way but there are also many who don't. There are many Jews who view themselves as members of the same nation as their gentile neighbors just with a different religion. This is one of the reasons why the holocaust was so ineffective in Denmark. Danish Jews were assimilated into Danish society and viewed by themselves and Danish Gentiles as Danes. For many in the Danish resistance, rescuing a Danish Jew was just like rescuing any other Dane. \n\nWhile Jewish conservatives do tend to be less opposed to immigration than Gentile conservatives (especially Jewish neocons), many of them would prefer a more restrictive immigration policy. There are also a lot of Jews drifting to the right due to the perceived threat of immigration from antisemitic countries. Have you ever looked into ADL's studies on how common antisemitism is across the world? There isn't any information available on Syria for reasons I'm sure you can guess but the antisemitism is rampant in all of the surrounding countries so I don't think it's wrong to assume Syria also has a major problem with antisemitism. Many right-wing nationalists in Europe, both mainstream nationalists like Wilders and academics like de Benoist, have been vocal about the antisemitism that often accompanies immigration from Southwest Asian and North African countries. A sizable portion of Jews realize that diversity isn't inherently good for Jews.\n\nWith that said, yes, there are also Jews who desire a more enthically,  racially, and religiously diverse society. For some, this is a conscious decision motivated by their belief that it will keep Jews safe. While I don't think multicultural societies are inherently more safe for Jews, I think it's a good thing that they are looking out for themselves. I think for most it's just part of a commitment to egalitarian values though. Due to the long history of oppression of Jews, a culture that values universalism and equality has emerged, especially among Eastern European Ashkenazim. This is understandable. \n\n&gt;It isn't a conspiracy theory if it's true. When something that should be yours is taken away, you find out who and take names, and there's a lot of (((them))).\n\nJews being overrepresented in these areas doesn't mean they're all your enemy though. This is the same logic used by misguided leftists who paint white people as the enemy. In fact, I think both far-right antisemites and leftists who dislike whites are often talking about the same thing. When you look at the list of the top 100 richest people on Earth, both of you see a minority overrepresented among the people responsible for many of the worst things happening in the world. For Susan Sontag, it was white men. For Andrew Anglin, it's Ashkenazi Jews. When you watch the Oscars, you see that Ashkenazim are overrepresented. When they do, they see white men (a group they consider Ashkenazim a part of) are overrepresented. The fact that an ethnic group wields a disproportionate amount of power in a corrupt society doesn't mean every member of that group is genetically programmed to corrupt everything around it.

I respect Oswald Mosley in this aspect, even though he talks about the JQ, he offers a hand to jews who want to prove themselves worthy of Britain citizenry.

The Jew is afraid of gentile nationalism.\n\n&gt;However, most progressive Jews are also opposed to the actions of Israel, especially radical leftists like (((Noam Chomsky))) and (((Judith Butler))).\n\nTrue. There are some drifters. Also, how progressive are we talking? I definitely understand being against unjust violence used by Israel, and pushing Palestinians off the land as a territory grab. I'm not sure about how many would support a one-state though, because if they do, they're pretty pozzed lol. \n\nBut overall, they're pretty anti-immigration unless it's more jews. Hate the double standard hypocrisy. This is what bothers me, they control certain institutions and try to justify pushing more 3rd worlders into our countries with slogans like \"diversity is our strength!\", then on the other side of their mouth and say \"sorry, we want to preserve our values and heritage in Israel\"\n\n&gt;There are also a number of Zionists who are supportive of nationalist movements in predominantly white countries. \n\nWhite or Jewish Zionists? lol I'm about as Zionist as far as believing they have a right to exist, etc\n\nDid you know that the (((ADL))) (which is a jewish organization) has funded groups to stop nationalist movements? Me neither, until recently.\n\n&gt;(((Soros))), a man who has become a symbol of international Jewish power for many on the far-right, is not an ally of Israel. \n\nI consider him a Globalist Super-Capitalist Super Jew lol. Even sells his own people out for shekels. Nothing is sacred to him, only money.\n\n&gt;Most of the hypocrisy you see is a result of viewing Jews as monolithic. \n\nI know that not every Jew is the same, it's just that once you see the pattern of history and behavior takes place, then it's eerie looking at everything unfolding, and you don't want to make that same mistake because history is forever.\n\n&gt;I would never deny that there are some Jews who think this way but there are also many who don't. There are many Jews who view themselves as members of the same nation as their gentile neighbors just with a different religion.\n\nFair. It goes both ways. However, it seems like the archetype of their jewishness is quite prevalent, like how some notable writing about their feeling of alienation in gentile society etc.\n\n&gt;This is one of the reasons why the holocaust was so ineffective in Denmark. Danish Jews were assimilated into Danish society and viewed by themselves and Danish Gentiles as Danes. For many in the Danish resistance, rescuing a Danish Jew was just like rescuing any other Dane. \n\nGood for them, then. Though seems like Denmark's nordic brother Sweden isn't so lucky with the jews, with literal calls of abolishing anything swede and then flooding them with refugees.\n\n&gt;There are also a lot of Jews drifting to the right due to the perceived threat of immigration from antisemitic countries.\n\n*supports and aids refugees to flood europe*\n\n\"This is good for Europe :) \"\n\n\"OH GOAWD, WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT INVITING ARABS WOULD'VE CAUSE A SPIKE IN ANTI-SEMITISM. geez, guess we can't take them back now. sorry, goy.  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\"\n\n&gt;\nMany right-wing nationalists in Europe, both mainstream nationalists like Wilders and academics like de Benoist, have been vocal about the antisemitism that often accompanies immigration from Southwest Asian and North African countries.

The profit incentive for businessmen remained, but was greatly modified; Nazi agencies replaced the profit motive that automatically allocated investment, and the course of the economy. **Generally, National Socialists had a history of hostility towards the business community, the profit motive, and \"unearned income\".** The Viennese-born economist Peter Drucker examined this **anti-capitalist disposition** in his 1939 book The End of Economic Man, explaining that \u201c**profits are so completely subordinated in [Nazi] Germany and [Fascist] Italy** to requirements of a militarily conceived national interest and of full employment that the maintenance of the profit principle is purely theoretical.\u201d[107] One German executive complained that **when a businessman makes a \u201csale at a higher price\u201d he could be \u201cdenounced as a \u2018profiteer\u2019 or \u2018saboteur,\u2019 followed by a prison sentence.\u201d**\n\nYou should try not denying reality.  Here's more:\n\n&gt;While not espousing a specific economic philosophy, Hitler employed anti-semitic themes to attack economic systems in other countries, **associating ethnic Jews with both communism (\"Jewish Bolsheviks\") and capitalism, both of which he opposed.**\n\nHhmm, that sounds like he opposes capitalism....gee, it's almost as if I had a point.\n\nBut those are just words and he does contradict himself on occasion....lets examine actions:\n\n&gt;In other cases, where the Nazi administration wanted additional industrial capacity, **they would first nationalize and then establish a new state-owned-and-operated company**. In 1937 Hermann G\u00f6ring targeted companies producing iron ore, \u201c**taking control of all privately owned steelworks** and setting up a new company, known as the Hermann G\u00f6ring Works.\"\n\n&gt;By 1943, up to 500 companies were owned by the German state.\n\n&gt;Those industries that somehow remained in private hands often received favoritism, subsidies and various state assistance. **Nonetheless, Hitler was \u201can enemy of free-market economics\u201d[50] whose regime was committed to an economic \"New Order\" controlled by the \"Party through a bureaucratic apparatus staffed by technical experts and dominated by political interests,\" similar to the economic planning of the Soviet Union.**\n\nTake a look at the left's recent upset at the latest Supreme court case where people no longer HAVE to pay unions....then see:\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, the Nazis replaced the existing trade unions with the German Labour Front, controlled by the Party. The National Socialists banned strikes, sacks and lockouts, essentially nationalizing the independent labor movement.[66][67] Furthermore, under Nazi **\u201cGermany the official unions have been made compulsory by law\u201d**, forcing every worker to join Hitler\u2019s state-owned labor union.[68]\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryanization_(Nazism)\n\n&gt;Aryanization (German: Arisierung) is a term coined during Nazism referring to the forced expulsion of so-called \"non-Aryans\", mainly Jews, from business life in Nazi Germany and the territories it controlled. It entailed the transfer of Jewish property into \"Aryan\" hands in order to \"de-Jew the economy\".\n\n&gt;The process started in 1933 in Nazi Germany with so-called \"voluntary\" transfers of Jewish property and ended with the Holocaust.[1][2] Two phases have generally been identified: a first phase in which the destitution of Jewish victims was concealed under a veneer of legality, and a second phase, in which property was more openly confiscated. In both cases, Aryanization corresponded to Nazi policy and was defined, supported and enforced by Germany's legal and financial bureaucracy.\n\nConfiscation of property and business from a select group of individuals.\n\nAgain, go read the previously noted declarations of DSA.

{"archived": false, "author": "SheepwithShovels", "body": "&gt;So imagine that this guy is a representation of the jewish people. You do some research and find out that they're huge slimeballs, they push smut and force it down people's throats, bring unauthorized people over (refugees and illegal mexicans) which disrespect your domain, extorts money, you get the point. An overall shitty roommate. It really isn't individual jews you have to worry about sometimes, it's their collective behavior. \n\nIn the Middle Ages, Jews were barred from a wide range of positions by antisemitic laws. This led to Jews being tax collectors, bankers, and economic advisors. Due to their over representation in these fields, they became the face of usury, high taxes, exploitation, and loss of property for a lot of people. However, the problem was/is not the Jewish people. The problem was/is usury, high taxes, and so on lol.\n\nI don't think you can really compare an individual roommate to an ethnic group. Many innocent Jews were kicked out of countries and persecuted as a result of the actions of a few Jews involved with finance. There were also baseless conspiracy theories about blood libels and poisoned wells were another motivation. They were also made into scapegoats because of their minority status and relationship with Christianity.\n\n&gt;I'm honestly still shocked on how much the jews have a hand in things in history, and how detrimental it is. \n\nHow do you feel about the contributions of Jews in western societies? Baruch Spinoza, Albert Einstein, Stanley Kubrick, Fritz Lang, Franz Kafka, Neils Bohr, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Edmund Husserl, Lou Reed, Schoenberg, Leonard Bernstein, Marcel Proust, and Isaac Asimov all had a significant and positive impact on their respective fields. I know you can respond to this by listing all sorts of Jewish individuals whom you dislike but I think recognizing the positive contributions is important. \n\n&gt;It is and can be both conscious and subconscious. Some jews have a real conscious hatred for european gentiles and want to hurt them\n\nI think those people are very rare. I know it's purely anecdotal but as I said before, I can't imagine any of the Jews I've known feeling this way. \n\n&gt;others might think they're doing good things for us because they have a messiah complex, wanting to enlighten the goys and bring them to a \"higher plane\". \n\nThis is an attitude which quite a few of those involved with academia seem to have. It's not exclusive to Jews. There are tons of white Gentiles who are like this too.\n\n&gt;Since jews are highly ethnocentric, they highly prioritize networking, so you see this huge network of jews working side by side or some time of cooperation since they're part of the tribe, basically family.\n&gt;They work to serve the group's collective interest, while disregarding the outgroup's interest, which is the native population that they reside in.\n\nThe same can be said about white Gentiles, especially historically. Two wrongs don't make a right but it does show that Jews are not alone in this behavior and since whites have grown less ethnocentric over the past 50-100 years, this isn't something that is impossible to change. With that said, I don't think ethnocentrism is inherently bad. As long as it isn't coming at the expense of other people, I see nothing wrong with Jews (or any other group) look out for themselves. \n\n&gt;Just in case you didn't know, germany had a communist uprising of their own after ww1 but it failed. 12 of the 15 leaders of the uprising were Jewish.\n\nI'm aware. I used to be a communist and still admire some communist figures, including Rosa Luxemburg. Despite my disagreements with her, I think she was an intelligent and brave individual who genuinely cared about the working class.\n\n&gt;There will always be good people. I have jewish friends myself.\n\nThat's good to hear that you don't let ethnicity/religion get in the way of friendship. If you can see that Jews can be good people, why do you stress the \"Jewish\" nature of international capitalism and communism rather than attacking the ideologies as ideologies? What do you think is gained from pointing out the number of Jewish people involved in these things? To me, it seems like it would only serve to increase prejudice against Jews as a whole. You think there's a Jewish problem. What's your solution? How might it impact your friends?\n\n&gt;Ohhhh boy lol. Biggest trick in the jew book.\n\nThere's a lot to address in this link. Firstly, Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews do appear as white to most people so I don't get what the big deal is about a Jewish woman pointing out that she has white skin and then recognizing that there are certain advantages that come with this. I'd have to read the article to know what she meant by \"white people are the problem\" but out of context, it does sound a bit bad. The Robin Morgan stuff is kind of sad. That sucks that she hates herself so much. I'm missing where wikipedia makes her out to be an antisemite though. It's also ridiculous to jump from self-hating white to Jewish supremacist. There's nothing in this link that makes her sound like she believes Jews are superior to gentiles. Once again, I'd need to read the article to know what he means but from the tiny bit that can be read in this link, it sounds like he is differentiating between \"legitimate white self-interest\" and racism. In one place he says that it's flawed to do this and in another he is saying these two things are not the same so it's unclear what he means. \n\nWhen it comes to the tweets, a few random people going back and forth between calling themselves Jews and white doesn't prove anything. If I collected a bunch of tweets from Nebraskans and juxtaposed ones where it sounds like they favor Nebraksa over America with ones saying they are Americans, what would that prove? There are a few people from Nebraska who prioritize the interests of their homestate over the country as a whole (something most people do since their loved ones tend to share their state) and they identify as both American and Nebraskan. I will concede that some of these are more hostile than just prioritizing Nebraska over America/identifying as both American and Nebraskan but I'm sure you could find plenty of tweets from white gentiles saying the same sort of stuff.  \n\n&gt;Fun fact: Some jews sometimes changed their last names to something that sounds white, so they won't be \"given away\".\n\nYou make this sound more sinister than it really is. Yes, some Jews changed their last names to fit in. Usually, this was done to escape antisemitism, not to infiltrate and destroy the goyim from within lol. A lot of European gentiles changed their name when coming to America. A notable example of this is Trump's family, whose original German name became a really dumb forced meme thanks to John Oliver.\n\n&gt;I wouldn't talk shit on friends and colleagues, that's just common courtesy. There's just some things you don't talk about. It might grown on them when they get older, though.\n\nI didn't have in-depth conversations on the topic with all of them but I can assure you that they weren't hiding feelings of supremacy or hatred of white Gentiles out of courtesy lol. I think they would've been honest with me if it came up. \n\nDo you talk to your Jewish friends about how you feel?\n\n&gt;Also another fun fact: On a survey on the subject of affirmative action, it first asked if they support AA, then asked basically \"would you support affirmative action, even if it hurt whites?\"\n\n&gt;Jewish support for this ROSE, while other ethnicity groups support went down. Weird! lol\n\nDid it control for political beliefs? Many Jews tend to be progressive. I could see support from progressive whites in general rising as a way to stress that they wouldn't let ethnocentrism get in the way of their conception of racial justice. \n\n&gt;But what is really scientific racism? Anything today on racial science is still considered \"scientific racism\" by some, which is BS.\n\nStudying differences between populations isn't racist. For example, it appears that East Africans tend to excel in long-distance running. They gave a few Kenyans with no experience in the field a bit of basic training and they were able to blow elite Danish long-distance runners away. I can't imagine any respectable scientist disputing that East Africans tend to do better in this area as a result of genetics. What would be racist is taking this information and saying it would justify their domination of other peoples. \n\nAnother form of scientific racism would be the work of someone like Richard Lynn, whose work on race and IQ is severely flawed. For example, the IQ he used for Equatorial Guinea was the mean score of a group of mentally disabled children descended from that country living in Spain. This is not an accurate representation of that country's average IQ. While I could be wrong on this, I don't think he controlled for socioeconomic status. Environmental factors don't have as big of an impact on these things as some people act like it does but that doesn't mean it's totally meaningless.\n\n&gt;I also think it's ok to say that certain people are more prone to things via biology when it's proven, such as blacks having less impulse control etc.\n\nI'm unaware of a study proving that black people have less impulse control as a result of genetics. \"Black people\" is an extremely broad category. There is a tremendous amount of genetic diversity in Sub-Saharan Africa. Earlier I mentioned how East Africans tend to excel in long distance running. This is not the case for all Africans. Interestingly, West Africans tend to excel in short distance running. Almost every person who has completed a 100 meter dash in under 10 seconds is West African part of the West African diaspora.

{"archived": false, "author": "commiespaceinvader", "body": "The key to this question is that while anti-Semitism spread in the following years, hard-core anti-Semitism among the German populace was not what enabled the Holocaust. Apathy and a non-caring attitude was. It sounds like a bit of a trite clich\u00e9 but the thing is that in order for genocide like the Holocaust to succeed, it is not necessary to have a population the majority of which is willing to slaughter millions of people. What you need is a population, the majority of which is apathetic towards the fate of their neighbors. Who is willing to stand by and do nothing while their neighbors are arrested, taken away, and killed.\n\nThe boycott was a failure because it relied too heavily on large swaths of the population being involved, especially in the urban centers where a lot of Jews lived and because a variety of stores and chains that were very convenient in those urban centers were also declared as targets of the boycott such as Woolworth (Woolworth was and is not a \"Jewish store\", even by Nazi standards).\n\nHistorian Janosch Steuwer has focused his research on diaries written in the years between 1933 and 1939 in his book *Ein Drittes Reich wie ich es auffasste* (A Third Reich how I perceived it) and based on these studies Steuwer writes that for the Nazi regime, their policy of social transformation through the collaboration of vast swaths of said society was heavily dependent on individual actions or rather non-actions. The Nazis' policy of course aimed for active involvement but was happy enough with apathy and a non-caring attitude that focused on an individual's lack of options or lack of care. The boycott represented a crucial learning experience in that regard.\n\nThe boycott was a flop because to many a German it represented a major inconvenience, not because an overall opposition to anti-Jewish measure. Something that the Nazis soon realized over the course of the boycott is that many Germans who were not opposed to their policies on principle or on ideological grounds still would retain the idea of their own \"good Jew\". Meaning that for many a German, they would go along with ideas such as Judeo-Bolshevism being a problem that needed to be fought by the new government but old Mr. Goldziegel where they bought their groceries was not related to that problem to them. They acknowledged that Jews were \"bad\" in principle with the whole world conspiracy thing and Bolshevism but to them, their grocer Goldziegel or their shoemaker Rosenstein had nothing to do with that. They were \"good Jews\" after all.\n\nThe very core of the Nazi social project was called the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" (people's / racial community). It represented the idea of a coherent racial national community in which all categories that divided the Germans from each other (class, Catholic and Protestant denomination etc.) would be abolished to form one harmonious community of the people. One of the main obstacles to this utopian community of all Germans living under the guidance of the F\u00fchrer were those who did not belong: Jews, socialists, communists, so-called asocials and so forth. To achieve \"Volksgemeinschaft\" it was both necessary to do what essentially boils down to community building but always coupled with the explicit necessity of \"cleansing\" the community from the \"foreign\" and the other.\n\nThrough community measures, from enabling people who otherwise were unable to drive cars in the NSKK, to organizing Sunday meals with the NS-Frauenschaft, to collective sports, to enabling people to go on holidays through the KdF to hundreds of similar activities, the Nazis build a consensus among the Germans that the regime was good to them and therefore would at least go quietly along with the exclusion of the various others from the community. In 1933, expecting people to boycott their grocer whom they had known for years was, as the regime noted, a bridge too far. But by 1938 when during the November pogrom members of the SA and SS burned down stores and arrested people en masse, what had occured was that the regime had fostered a popular attitude of \"the Nazis are doing good stuff for us, so how bad could they be?\"\n\nThis consent was manufactured through community activities, popular measures by the regime such as arresting communists, political successes such as the re-militarization of the Rhineland and from profiting from the end of the world economic crisis. I have talked about [framing before here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8si6x5/monday_methods_the_children_will_go_bathing_on/) and the central issue is that via propagating the Volksgemeinschaft, doing community building geared paired with the explicit need of the need to get rid of outsiders, the social and thereby individual frame of what was acceptable to the German population moved towards harsher and more radical measure being at least accepted if people didn't start to participate outright.\n\nThe push towards cruelty and criminality was always paired with measure positive for the majority population and clad in a language of necessity and also often security. If Jews were arrested and imprisoned by the Nazis, it was because they were criminals or communists. If they were deported, people told themselves that was because they were going to the East to be resettled despite in many cases knowing better. If an ordinary Wehrmacht soldier was ordered to shoot women and children, kill people by using them as living mine probes, and so forth it was because these people were Partisans, because they were dangerous to the Germans by their mere presence, because it was lawful as he was told.\n\nIn 1933/34 when the boycott was called, vast swaths of society were still not ready to forsake something convienent to them for political reasons. The process of moving the frame, of re-framing these actions, of changing individual behavior at large takes time and is largely achieved through measures considered in some way positive to those parts of the population not affected by these measures of exclusion and also by constructing an atmosphere of fear and danger. Bolshevism, for example, was something that represented danger to most Germans, especially those who had lived through the end of WWI and had seen revolution. By constantly associating Jews with Bolsheviks and highlighting how other, un-German, and so forth they were, this atmosphere of fear and danger was created. But at the same time the regime would institute measure beneficial and positive to the majority population because they needed both in order to convince people of the larger concept of the Volksgemeinschaft that was so instrumental on moving individual and social frames of behavior.\n\nIn creating a claim to empowerment by actively working towards the Volksgemeinschaft, individual Germans became willing to commit crimes on a massive scale or at least ignore them or be apathetic towards them.\n\nSources:\n\n* Janosch Steuwer: Ein Drittes Reich wie ich es auffasste.\n\n* Michael Wildt: Volksgemeinschaft als Selbsterm\u00e4chtigung.

Islam is designed to be a colonialist enterprise whereas Zionism is a purely anti-colonialist and indigenous endevour. Notice how Israel ceded the Sinai, Gaza, and South Lebanon because Zionism is not colonialist. Jews don't want to occupy anything that is not Native lands and therefore don't settle in Sinai, Gaza, or South Lebanon.\n\n&gt; Why should a non-Jew ever tolerate Zionism?\n\nOver 90% of the Non-Jew Christians in the Middle East fled and they only exist in Zionist Israel at this point. The Non-Jew Israeli Arabs have full equal rights and live better in Israel than in any Arab countries (by GDP). They don\u2019t only have equal rights, they have more rights, as non-Jews have a right Jews do not, the right to refuse to do military service. They can go on the Temple Mount without being escorted by security. Israelis, especially if they are in IDF uniform, get punished severely by Israeli law for committing any kind of hate crime or discriminatory act against an Israeli minority. In contrast, the Palestinian Authority rewards those and the families of those who commit crimes against Israelis, from throwing rocks to suicide bombings, with money, fame, and prestige.\n\n&gt;  We're not the chosen people\n\nThe old fashioned White nationalists anti-semites who used tiki torches to light up Charlottesville march makes those arguments against Jews to win an argument. Ironic you are doing this too. \n\n&gt;  under Zionism we don't deserve to live on the planet \n\nBlood libel anti-semitism. You are a bigot. \n\n&gt; To tolerate Zionism would be to approve of calling myself the derogatory term goyim.\n\nYou are merely spewing \"old style\" anti-semitism. Just look at this article from wikipedia on [Jews as the chosen people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews_as_the_chosen_people). What you are saying is just something to justify your hate. It has no bearing on reality. Jews dont think non-Jews are inferior. You have never met a Jew so you make stupid assumptions. Goyim means \"the nations\" as in people in other nations. \n\n&gt;  Who is it you want exterminated and why is your life so much more valuable?\n\nPalestinians have 4x times increased in population since Israel's inception. Highest rate in the world. It is highly unusual for Jews to butcher humans and rape women. These are not crimes typically associated with Jewish men. Reductio ad Hitlerum. Anyone who speaks about Israel-first is automatically supporting genocide against all Palestinians and is literally a Nazi.\n\n&gt; Referring to the tactics of the far left shows you are obsessed with paranoid conspiracies. \n\nThe word Nazi is from National Socialism. Hitler ran his country with Socialist Gun Control for Jews only and Socialized healthcare for non-Jews only. He greased the socialist wheels by using the slave labor of Jews. As a Jew its important to find distinction and similarity between these two people.\n\nSocialist Bernie Sanders would never let a neo-Nazi like Andrew Anglin campaign for him, he did just that with Linda Sarsour, a prominent Anti-semite. Socialism believes that its goals are more important then any other -ism (Zionism) which is the angle Bernie is going for.\n\nThe reality is that most of the anti-semitism that exists in western society is by anti-Israel leftist socialists and only a minority is by far right activists.\n\nAnti-semitism within Socialist Venezuela is [awful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_Venezuela).

The difference? If one takes away the cause, then anti-Semitism should no longer exist. If one can show a contradiction to the explanation, it demonstrates that the \"cause\" is not a reason, it is just an excuse. Let's look at some contradictions:\n\nEconomic -- The Jews of 17th- 20th century Poland and Russia were dirt poor, had no influence and yet they were hated.\n\nChosen People -- a) In the late 19th century, the Jews of Germany denied \"Choseness.\" And then they worked on assimilation. Yet, the holocaust started there. b) Christians and Moslems profess to being the \"Chosen people,\" yet, the world and the anti-Semites tolerate them. \n\nScapegoat -- Any group must already be hated to be an effective scapegoat. The Scapegoat Theory does not then cause anti-Semitism. Rather, anti-Semitism is what makes the Jews a convenient scapegoat target. Hitler's ranting and ravings would not be taken seriously if he said, \"It's the bicycle riders and the midgets who are destroying our society.\" \n\nDeicide -- a) the Christian Bible says the Romans killed Jesus, though Jews are mentioned as accomplices (claims that Jews killed Jesus came several hundred years later). How come the accomplices are persecuted and there isn't an anti-Roman movement through history? b) Jesus himself said, \"Forgive them [i.e., the Jews], for they know not what they do.\" The Second Vatican Council in 1963 officially exonerated the Jews as the killers of Jesus. Neither statement of Christian belief lessened Antisemitism.\n\nOutsiders -- With the Enlightenment in the late 18th century, many Jews rushed to assimilate. Antisemitism should have stopped. Instead, for example, with the Nazis came the cry, in essence: \"We hate you, not because you're different, but because you're trying to become like us! We cannot allow you to infect the Aryan race with your inferior genes.\"\n\nRacial Theory -- The overriding problem with this theory is that it is self-contradictory: Jews are not a race. Anyone can become a Jew - and members of every race, creed and color in the world have done so at one time or another.(this is disputed, even by jews, the current classification is jews are a ethno-religious group)\n\nEvery other hated group is hated for a relatively defined reason. We Jews, however, are hated in paradoxes: Jews are hated for being a lazy and inferior race - but also for dominating the economy and taking over the world. We are hated for stubbornly maintaining our separateness - and, when we do assimilate - for posing a threat to racial purity through intermarriages. We are seen as pacifists and as warmongers; as capitalist exploiters and as revolutionary communists; possessed of a Chosen-People mentality, as well as of an inferiority complex. It seems that we just can't win.\n\nNow we know what are NOT the reasons for anti-Semitism.\n\nThese are just the excuses that have been used over the century, honestly trying to explain why jews are hated is A fruitless argument, they have been scapegoats for centuries, there is no explanation outside of the historical fact hatred of the jews has been ingrained into western society for centuries, the jews themselves are a small easily identifiable and susceptible to attack more then any other group.

I find that amazing, hell it's one of the reasons why i support the Jewish people, because throughout their history many amazing Jewish individuals and groups have gone head first into helping others, not because they expected a reward or to be lauded but because it was the right thing to do.

{"archived": false, "author": "Ilforte", "body": "OK (even though I don't expect any good to come out of it). \nImagine me answering to eaturbrainz.\n\nTo begin with, Happy Merchant is undoubtedly an antisemitic meme, since it's a symbol of a malicious Jew, and an implication that Jews are innately prone to be similar to such a symbol (much like any depiction of a stereotype). But the Jew as a concept, in turn, is often a symbol for something else, and I suspect that people subconsciously understand this \u2013 sometimes to a silly effect.  \n\nConsider, for example, the story of [a \"vile mural\" in London](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/antisemitism-open-your-eyes-jeremy-corbyn-labour). Read the arguments for the apparency of the mural's antisemitism. Do they strike you as convincing? As for me, they do not. In fact I'm plenty insulted with the condescension in the idea that such manipulative and low-brow explanations are supposed to be enlightening. \u00abSitting around a table is a group of rotund men: one has a full beard, and is counting money. **That, in and of itself, is an antisemitic symbol.\u00bb** \u2013 oh wow, I think, and I check the comments and start looking down on the Western populace even more, and I hope a little that one day the ruthless transhuman Han Chinese will wipe the floor with these smug self-righteous babbling infants in suits... erm. I digress. \n\nSome wiser comments suggest that this was merely a fabricated outrage intended to hurt Corbyn's chances in the election via lowering Jewish trust in him, but this too is irrelevant. \n\nWhat is relevant, instead, is that only two of these six men are Jewish, namely Warburg and Rothschild, while the rest are the good Christians Morgan, Rockefeller, Carnegie and (for some reason) Alistair Crowley. Jewishness is not an essential part of the picture. Yet we still get to be lectured on the symbolism of large crooked noses, all the while what's really being depicted is the oppressive rule of global financial elite, bankers and magnates, a classical communistic agitprop. All the symbols \u2013 the subjugated peoples of the world, the money-counting, the eye in the pyramid \u2013 make perfect sense if you look at it this way. But people are expecting antisemitism as soon as they see these symbols, and look for confirmation. (As an aside, this reminds me of a recent thread about dog breeds). \n\nNow, how does this relate to the Happy Shingeki meme? While there is a very strong trend in conspiracy theories to associate Jews and any sort of specific evil project, and while there are genuine Nazis, simple antisemites and random trolls hopping on the bandwagon, and while the narrative of \"Cultural Marxism destroying Western civilization\" invariably includes Frankfurt school and its many Jewish champions, this is not an opposition *driven* by antisemitism. This, just like the aforementioned mural, is an opposition to a threat, whether real or imagined, that's additionally perceived to be championed by Jews. And like it or not, if you confidently self-identify as a leftist, the threat these people rally against is your *culture*. Inasmuch as Israel is any indication, it's not an innately Jewish culture; but it seems to be a North American (and to a lesser degree Western in general) liberal one, and Jews play in it no smaller \u2013 or bigger \u2013 a part than certain other affluent White groups (I don't find it useful to distinguish Jews and Whites, at least not in this context). \n\nSo, as to why I'm sure that you'll be unable to understand any of this. Because you've stated so yourself! The culture I'm speaking of is your *norm*, you don't see how it's different from some general civility, kindness and common sense, at most you conceptualize it as \"progressive values\". You, despite identifying as a leftist (politically and/or economically, I guess), don't identify as a culture-bearer, and don't see others as having such identities. Your idea of a culture is comically underdeveloped, if you're not kidding, and it'd be a hopeless endeavor to try to change that now. On the other hand, as a modern American, you're strongly invested in ethnic identity. So, when you're observing a meme that's literally depicting a colossal Jew attacking some vague \"culture\", any finer nuances are swamped out by THIS IS ANTISEMITIC signal. Which it is, but the message it's really carrying is not about Jews, and if there were no Jews present, it'd switch to some other caricature. \n\nPersonally I don't think I have a place on the political compass, but I do share this general feeling or revulsion towards the implied \"attack on culture\" that leftists perpetuate, which makes me look right-ish to them. At the same time, I don't hate Jews or their culture and history, in fact most of the people I deeply respect happen to be Jewish, including Scott. So it's unfortunate that this association is so entrenched as to make discussion fruitless \u2013 and I suspect that the left wouldn't have it any other way, too.

{"archived": false, "author": "a0i", "body": "&gt;It must drive you all batty.\n\nNot really, since everything in society is referred to as \"fascism\" and everyone is called \"Nazi\". It annoys me about as much as establishment Democrats being referred to as \"commies\". Some of them literally are, but for the most part, they're the same globalist neo-con foreign policy + neo-liberal economic policy as the majority of Washington legislators, from either party. \"Nazi\" has become one of those magic trigger words people deploy to shut down thought and discourse. Natsoc had a racialist worldview shared in broad strokes with WEB DuBois; the latter is taught in African American studies, diversity courses, and post-colonial theory -- but National Socialism is never taught, not even accurately in graduate level history courses where it is routinely eschewed for topics like Jewish Civil Rights and the Holocaust.  \n\n\nWhat troubles me more is how NS/Fascism is treated as a \"dangerous\" ideology, one we can't consider openly for fear of demonic possession, and the involuntary deaths of another 20 million Semites. Routinely, \"respectable\" academics will rationalize away the brutality of Marxist/communist movements, regarding these as \"not true marxism/socialism/communism\". Cornell West will see no empirical conclusion to draw about how Marxist movements lead society to attack and pogrom itself; if millions died in the Holodmor (which was just an accident, not intentional mas starvation), it is obviously not Marxism, because Marx was compassionate, caring, and concerned with saving people from evil things, you see? \n\nAll \"evil\" done by Marxists has nothing to do with their willingness to achieve impossible goals by \"any means necessary\". The extremes they went to to realize Marx's predictions were completely aberrant. Men like Stalin were really just \"closet fascists\", that's why they Holodomor-ed (supposedly) orders of magnitude more than all fascists combined. You see, \"real communism\" has never been tried/succeeded because the capitalist white-supreemist patriarchy always conspires to make \"real socialism\" fail. There is of course truth in this, but it's true of every ideology; competitor states, ethnicities, and ideological movements are constantly engaged in efforts to make their competitors fail. Any movement that can't deal with that kind of external pressure isn't viable -- which brings us back to asking why communism always resorted to such brutality in order to function.  \n\n\nMost troubling of all is the way lolbergs and kosher cuckservatives will deliberately mis-represent NS/Fascism as \"communism\", so they don't have to admit that ***we fought \"The Great War\" against anti-communists, to enable the spread of communism across the globe.***", "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "DebateFascism", "date_year_month": "2018-07", "created_utc_converted": "2018-07-10 18:50:01", "score_overall": 4, "words": "globalist jewish holocaust kosher", "shared_words": "globalist jewish holocaust kosher", "socre_distint": 4}
{"archived": false, "author": "HeadStonemason", "body": "I appreciate the curiosity. It's a really big question, one that is in some ways unanswerable because of it's simplistic premise. You have to take in on a case by case basis, and also take into account examples of Jews not being expelled. The beliefs that informed anti-semitism were fluid and contextual. \n\nIf we're speaking in very broad strokes, the answer is scapegoating. While there have been Muslim and Christian dominant spheres of the globe, the Jews have lacked a geographical area. As such, they have always been a minority culture, and easy to blame when times get tough. Anytime there is an attempt at creating a monoculture state (think \"we are a Catholic nation\"), groups outside the new definition will suffer.\n\nIn medieval and early-modern Europe Jews had a monopoly on usury because of the law (depending on the country, this is again very general). People tend to not like or trust money lenders, particularly when a loan doesn't work out for them. This leads to a very easy association of Jews with predatory practices, an association that is easily inflamed at times of economic hardship, even after Christians began being allowed to charge interest. \n\nBut to go back to the question about expulsions, take the Spanish Inquisition. For much of this period, you could be a Muslim or Jew, you just suffered severe social restrictions because of it. If you converted to Catholicism, those were lifted. The Inquisition was concerned with finding people from both camps that continue to practice their old faith in private, calling them heretics. It wasn't purely anti-semitism driving this effort, but it was a huge part of it. There was a huge expelling of Muslim-Christian converts in the 1600s.\n\nTake a look at this list, and notice how a lot of the expulsions tend to come in clusters around decades. This can be attributed to periods of economic hardship, and particular surges in anti-semitic feeling: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsions_and_exoduses_of_Jews \n\nA big issue in Holocaust and Jewish studies is the notion of 'forbidden knowledge.' Basically, if you grew up in the West, Holocaust education was a significant component of your schooling. We've been surrounded by messages that the Holocaust happened, was wrong, and because its living memory, it is totally unacceptable to question the master narrative.\n\nSuch a strong message creates a taboo that can be exploited by neo-Nazis looking to prey on curious, but uniformed minds. This strategy usually takes extremely complex, sprawling subjects, and boils them down to pointed, leading questions shrouded in intellectual inquiry. Take a look at the comments on this post, for example:\n\n&gt;\"Did you know questioning the Holocaust is illegal in 16 countries + Israel? Why would that be?\"\n\nWhat posing questions this way does is it opens up the idea of a grand Jewish conspiracy pulling the strings behind all these nations. The reality is that the legislative process is different in each country, and while there were similar players in the passing of several nations laws, there are enough separate organizations and individuals to disprove any notion of a sweeping \"cause.\" Comments like that are designed to trick otherwise intelligent adults by asking seemingly open-ended questions that have naturally anti-semitic conclusions.\n\nEdit: Here's a specific example of hatred from Pope Paul IV's Cum Nimis Absurdum (1555), which applied new restrictions on Jews in Catholic countries. These included requiring all men to wear a pointed yellow hat, and made attendance at Catholic services on the Jewish shabbat/Friday a requirement. It relates to blaming Jews for killing Christ:\n\n&gt;\"Since it is completely senseless and inappropriate to be in a situation where Christian piety allows the Jews (whose guilt-all of their own doing-has condemned them to eternal slavery) access to our society and even to live among us; indeed, they are without gratitude to Christians, as, instead of thanks for gracious treatment, they return invective, and among themselves, instead of the slavery, which they deserve, they manage to claim superiority\"", "score": 62, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Documentaries", "date_year_month": "2018-07", "created_utc_converted": "2018-07-10 18:54:54", "score_overall": 9, "words": "jew holocaust jewish holocaust holocaust holocaust jewish conspiracy jewish", "shared_words": "jew holocaust jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

Well turns out it's a non lethal delousing agent, which had the distinctive trait of dyeing things blue. This is why the so called \"gas chambers\" have blue walls. \nThe Leuchter Report: One of the pieces of evidence Professor Ernst Zundel produced at his trials in Canada was the \u201cLeuchter Report\u201d compiled by Fred Leuchter on his commission. Fred Leuchter is the World\u2019s foremost expert on gas chambers, and holds the patents for nearly all the gas chambers used for executions in the World. He has also personally built, or supervised the building, of all gas chambers in the USA and most in the rest of the World.\nAfter inspecting the alleged gas chambers at Auschwitz, Leuchter concluded they were unsuitable for use as gas chambers due to their lack of airtight doors, lack of a gas extraction system and general shoddy build. He also chemically analysed the walls for ferrocyanide (produced when Zyklon-B reacts with brick walls) and concluded there was none \u2013 the Auschwitz authorities took the same tests with the same results and now admit there was no gas chamber in Auschwitz.\n2. The World Almanac in 1933 has the Jewish population at 15.3 million in 1948 the Jewish population was 15.7 million. The Jewish population miraculously lost 6 Million and still made the difference plus 400k. Wow.\n3. Churchill, Eisenhower or De Gaulle's Memoirs never mentioned the holocaust. \n4. Patton's letters home after the war never mentioned the holocaust. \n5. The chimneys for the alleged crematorium were built after the war. Photos of Auschwitz before and after the war have proven this. \n6. The Red Cross knew the factual numbers of Jews in \"labour\" camps to be 271,000.\n7. The three most famous holocaust survivors, Elie Wiesel, Otto Frank and Primo Levi, have something in common - when the Soviet army approached Auschwitz, they were all in camp hospitals; of which there were several. Wiesel was being treated for at an Auschwitz hospital for an infected foot. The Nazis gave him the option of waiting to be liberated by the Soviets, or evacuating to the west. Wiesel, with his father, chose to leave with the Nazis. This is noted in his book Night, describing his year at Auschwitz. When Wiesel was in Auschwitz, the Nazis were supposedly killing 10,000 Jews per day in gas chambers disguised as shower rooms. There is not a single mention of gas chambers in the book.\n8. The number of holocaust official deaths has lowered throughout the years. From 6 million, to the now official numbers being 1.1 million. \n9. No mass graves have ever been officially found. \n10. The Concentration Camp Crematorium \nOne of the main problems with the \"6 million Jews being murdered\" claim was disposal of the bodies. It was claimed at Nuremberg that they had been disposed of in the camp crematorium. There were crematoriums in each camp, but they simply didn\u2019t have the capacity. Each crematorium oven could burn a body in about one and a half hours, meaning a maximum capacity of 16 bodies every day, or just less than 6000 bodies per year per oven. The camps had between four and twelve ovens, each giving 24,000 to 72,000 bodies per year, maximum, at each camp \u2013 this still wouldn\u2019t be possible as you can\u2019t run these ovens non-stop without the metal fracturing. Even double or triple loading wouldn\u2019t help, as this increased the time to three hours for two bodies or four and a half hours for three bodies. Also, bodies aren\u2019t totally reduced by this process and usually leave the pelvis and thigh bones which need crushing with special machinery \u2013 no such machinery was found at any of the camps. There is also the problem of fuel, as each body would need about 40 kilograms of coke to burn \u2013 there is no record of the massive amount of coke required being supplied\n11. United States Air Force Aerial Photos Of Camps \nFrom 1942, until the end of World War Two, the United States Air Force performed low flying, low-speed photography of all the alleged \u201cdeath camps\u201d to obtain evidence of what was going on. This followed Jewish claims in the West that a mass murder was occurring. All these photographs were released in 1979 when they were declassified. None of these photographs show any sign of mass murder or disposal of millions of bodies.\n12. Western Allies Never Liberated Any Death Camps With Gas Chambers \nNone of the Western Allies (Britain, Canada, USA, Australia, France etc.) liberated any camps that had gas chambers, or other systems of mass murder in them. All of the alleged death camps with gas chambers were liberated by the Russians. Consequently, any alleged evidence of death camps and/or gas chambers was forthcoming solely from Soviet Russia. The Western Allies liberated a total of 12 main camps and the Soviet Russians 8 main camps.\n13. The British Secret Service cracked the German Enigma Code in 1942 and never once recovered any evidence of mass murders taking place. \n14. The French Resistance Denied The Holocaust \nDuring World War Two, Germany invaded France and occupied Northern France from 1940 to 1944. A secret army of French Patriots, known collectively as \u201cThe French Resistance,\u201d fought the German occupiers in various ways. A large number of French Resistance members were imprisoned, tortured, and executed, including their leader and French National hero, Jean Moulin. After World War Two, French Resistance members were released from various German concentration camps, including Auschwitz and other alleged death camps. On their return to France, they all gave horrific accounts of their treatment by the Germans, and were full of hatred for them because of the events of World War Two. However, they all denied any knowledge of gas chambers and a mass murder program in the concentration camps. \n15. The Gas Chambers Of World War One \nIt was widely reported during World War One (1914 to 1918) that the Germans, and their allies, were using gas chambers to kill thousands of prisoners. However, after the end of the War, Stanley Baldwin admitted in Parliament that it had been propaganda and no such gas chambers had existed. He also apologized publicly to the German People for this racist slur on them.\n16. The fake photos of holocaust were actually falsified, using photos of the Bolshevik Jews starvation of the German 6th army and the Holodomor Ukrainian holocaust of 1932 and 1933.\n17. During World War One, the British Government had agreed with leading Jews that they would support a Jewish homeland in Palestine in exchange for the powerful Jewish lobby in America getting the USA to join the Allies. This led to the Balfour Declaration being made by the British Government promising the Jews a homeland in Palestine. After discussions in the British Cabinet, and consultation with Zionist leaders, the decision was made known in the form of a letter by Arthur James Lord Balfour to Lord Rothschild. The letter represents the first political recognition of Zionist aims by a Great Power.\n\nAfter World War One, the British Government was unable, or unwilling, to make good on this promise. From 1919 onward, the Jews claimed 6 million Jews in Europe were under threat from extermination unless they got a homeland in Palestine. This was 14 years before the Nazis came to power and 24 years before the alleged Holocaust started.\n\nThe Jews have been waving the 6 million figure around since before 1900.\n\n\"In all of German-occupied Europe there were an estimated 2.4 million Jews. After the war, 3.8 million Jews applied for Holocaust reparations. Tragically, the remaining six million were lost.\"\n\nIn Sept of 1939, the Polish Bolshevik massacre of 58,000 German nationals began in the Danzig Corridor in the months leading up to World War Two. In one instance, called the Bromberg Massacre (also known as Bloody Sunday), a small German town was attacked by Jews backed by the Polish Army. This was all carried out to push Germany into a war with the Zionists.\n\nThe vast majority of Bolsheviks were Jewish, with 82% being Ashkenazi. Stalin grew up Catholic because of his mother.\n\nTHE BOLSHEVIKS SAY STALIN WAS A JEW. ONE, A CAPTAIN IN THE CZAR\u2019S ARMIES, STATED THAT HE KNEW STALIN IN THEIR BOYHOOD AND THAT STALIN\u2019S FATHER (DZHUGASHVILI) WAS \u201cA JEWISH COBBLER.\u201d\n\nNow on to Hitler, who didn't hate Jews or Slavs, but rather wanted to save his people. This is why so many Jews served in the German army. There were over 150,000 Jews serving in the German Wehrmacht - two field marshals, 10 generals, 14 colonels, 30 majors and numerous other lower ranking officers. Also, France invaded Germany before Germany invaded France. \n\nStalin most certainly was planning on taking Germany.\n\nFrom George S Patton's letters home after the war:\n\nOn July 21, 1945, Patton wrote to his wife: \u201cBerlin gave me the blues. We have destroyed what could have been a good race, and we are about to replace them with Mongolian savages. And all Europe will be Communist. It\u2019s said that for the first week after they took [Berlin], all women who ran were shot and those who did not were raped. I could have taken it (instead of the Soviets) had I been allowed.\u201d\n\nCredit goes to /u/WotansWolves", "score": -11, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Documentaries", "date_year_month": "2018-07", "created_utc_converted": "2018-07-10 22:25:19", "score_overall": 19, "words": "khazars jewish jewish jewish holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust jewish holocaust holocaust holocaust jewish jewish holocaust holocaust jewish jew jewish", "shared_words": "khazars jewish holocaust jew", "socre_distint": 4}
{"archived": false, "author": "charmed_im-sure", "body": "Risk assessment. So, we're in the clear? \n\nGenocide is a process that develops in ten stages that are predictable but not inexorable. At each stage, preventive measures can stop it. The process is not linear. Stages may occur simultaneously. Logically, later stages must be preceded by earlier stages. But all stages continue to operate throughout the process.\n\n1 - Classification: All cultures have categories to distinguish people into \u201cus and them\u201d by ethnicity, race, religion, or nationality: German and Jew, Hutu and Tutsi. Bipolar societies that lack mixed categories are the most likely to have genocide. The main preventive measure at this early stage is to develop universalistic institutions that transcend ethnic or racial divisions, that actively promote tolerance and understanding, and that promote classifications that transcend the divisions. \n\n 2 - Symbolization: We give names or other symbols to the classifications. We name people \u201cJews\u201d or \u201cGypsies,\u201d or distinguish them by colors or dress; and apply the symbols to members of groups. Classification and symbolization are universally human and do not necessarily result in genocide unless they lead to dehumanization. When combined with hatred, symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of pariah groups. \n\n3 - Discrmination: A dominant group uses law, custom, and political power to deny the rights of other groups. The powerless group may not be accorded full civil rights, voting rights, or even citizenship. The dominant group is driven by an exclusionary ideology that would deprive less powerful groups of their rights. The ideology advocates monopolization or expansion of power by the dominant group. It legitimizes the victimization of weaker groups. Advocates of exclusionary ideologies are often charismatic, expressing resentments of their followers, attracting support from the masses. \n\n4 - Dehumanization: One group denies the humanity of the other group. Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects or diseases. Dehumanization overcomes the normal human revulsion against murder. At this stage, hate propaganda in print and on hate radios is used to vilify the victim group. The majority group is taught to regard the other group as less than human, and even alien to their society. They are indoctrinated to believe that \u201cWe are better off without them.\u201d The powerless group can become so depersonalized that they are actually given numbers rather than names, as Jews were in the death camps. They are equated with filth, impurity, and immorality. Hate speech fills the propaganda of official radio, newspapers, and speeches.\n\n5 - Organization: Genocide is always organized, usually by the state, often using militias to provide deniability of state responsibility. (An example is the Sudanese government\u2019s support and arming of the Janjaweed in Darfur.) Sometimes organization is informal (Hindu mobs led by local RSS militants during Indian partition) or decentralized (jihadist terrorist groups.) Special army units or militias are often trained and armed. Arms are purchased by states and militias, often in violation of UN Arms Embargos, to facilitate acts of genocide. States organize secret police to spy on, arrest, torture, and murder people suspected of opposition to political leaders. Special training is given to murderous militias and special army killing units.\n\n6 - Polarization: Extremists drive the groups apart. Hate groups broadcast polarizing propaganda. Motivations for targeting a group are indoctrinated through mass media. Laws may forbid intermarriage or social interaction. Extremist terrorism targets moderates, intimidating and silencing the center. Moderates from the perpetrators\u2019 own group are most able to stop genocide, so are the first to be arrested and killed. Leaders in targeted groups are the next to be arrested and murdered. The dominant group passes emergency laws or decrees that grants them total power over the targeted group. The laws erode fundamental civil rights and liberties. Targeted groups are disarmed to make them incapable of self-defense, and to ensure that the dominant group has total control.\n\n7 - Preparation: Plans are made for genocidal killings. National or perpetrator group leaders plan the \u201cFinal Solution\u201d to the Jewish, Armenian, Tutsi or other targeted group \u201cquestion.\u201d They often use euphemisms to cloak their intentions, such as referring to their goals as \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d \u201cpurification,\u201d or \u201ccounter-terrorism.\u201d They build armies, buy weapons and train their troops and militias. They indoctrinate the populace with fear of the victim group. Leaders often claim that \u201cif we don\u2019t kill them, they will kill us,\u201d disguising genocide as self-defense. Acts of genocide are disguised as counter-insurgency if there is an ongoing armed conflict or civil war. There is a sudden increase in inflammatory rhetoric and hate propaganda with the objective of creating fear of the other group. Political processes such as peace accords that threaten the total dominance of the genocidal group or upcoming elections that may cost them their grip on total power may actually trigger genocide.\n\n Prevention of preparation may include arms embargoes and commissions to enforce them. It should include prosecution of **incitement and conspiracy to commit genocide, both crimes under Article 3 of the Genocide Convention**.\n\n 8 - Persecution: Victims are identified and separated out because of their ethnic or religious identity. Death lists are drawn up. In state sponsored genocide, members of victim groups may be forced to wear identifying symbols. Their property is often expropriated. Sometimes they are even segregated into ghettoes, deported into concentration camps, or confined to a famine-struck region and starved. They are deliberately deprived of resources such as water or food in order to slowly destroy them. Programs are implemented to prevent procreation through forced sterilization or abortions. **Children are forcibly taken from their parents.**  The victim group\u2019s basic human rights become systematically abused through extrajudicial killings, torture and forced displacement.  Genocidal massacres begin. They are acts of genocide because they intentionally destroy part of a group. The perpetrators watch for whether such massacres meet any international reaction. If not, they realize that that the international community will again be bystanders and permit another genocide. \n     \nAt this stage, a Genocide Emergency must be declared. If the political will of the great powers, regional alliances, or U.N. Security Council or the U.N. General Assembly can be mobilized, armed international intervention should be prepared, or heavy assistance provided to the victim group to prepare for its self-defense. \n\n9 - Extermination: begins, and quickly becomes the mass killing legally called \u201cgenocide.\u201d It is \u201cextermination\u201d to the killers because they do not believe their victims to be fully human. When it is sponsored by the state, the armed forces often work with militias to do the killing. Sometimes the genocide results in revenge killings by groups against each other, creating the downward whirlpool-like cycle of bilateral genocide. \n \n10 - Denial: is the final stage that lasts throughout and always follows genocide. It is among the surest indicators of further genocidal massacres. The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves, burn the bodies, try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses. They deny that they committed any crimes, and often blame what happened on the victims. They block investigations of the crimes, and continue to govern until driven from power by force, when they flee into exile. There they remain with impunity, like Pol Pot or Idi Amin, unless they are captured and a tribunal is established to try them.\n\nref: http://genocidewatch.net/genocide-2/8-stages-of-genocide/\n", "score": 4, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "politics", "date_year_month": "2018-07", "created_utc_converted": "2018-07-11 02:15:02", "score_overall": 4, "words": "jew silencing jewish conspiracy", "shared_words": "jew silencing jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

Jews have been an easy scapegoat from the start when Christianity spread across Europe. They are blamed for killing a magical zombie man so discrimination seems like proper retaliation to all of its maniacal believers.\n\n2. Jewish people are already being seen as evil, secondary citizens throughout the centuries so any success their communities see are seen as unfair &amp; undeserved to  non-Jews. So being associated with wealth in a negative way fuels the ugly envy &amp; hatred for outsiders.\n\n\n3. Every kingdom in europe finds a scapegoat for its economical, political, social strife, etc. The Black Death happening? Blame da Jooos. Your business aint doing so good? JOOS. No dont blame diseased animals carrying the sickness or your terrible business practices, just make a scapegoat &amp; act like you're the real victim of a jew takeover. So easy!\n\n\n4. Same shit happens in Germany. Fatty, turd for a mustache manlet makes all non-\"Aryan\" the reason why their country has a ton of debt. Surely it wasnt because of having gone thru a world war decades earlier, no its all because of those damn Joos, blacks, lgbt+, romani, etc. Vulnerable people need a way to vent their frustrations over their financial troubles &amp; rebuilding after the first war and also want to find a way to be proud of their country, so they eat Shitler's bullshit up likes its Sunday morning pancakes. \nThey know what theyre doing is horrible but they're so brainwashed into thinking theyre helping their own country, theres no hope for rationality.\n\n\n5. Early 20th century immigration of many Jewish families to safer countries rises due to many reasons. Said Jewish families settle into new countries &amp; work hard like other immigrants. Non-jewish immigrants bring their bigotry from home &amp; continue to spout the same bullshit. Some jewish families get lucky &amp; hit it rich while others have mild or no success. Lucky Jewish families work their hands to the bone to climb from poor to rich classes. They get or create access to higher education &amp; better opportunities for their fellow jews. \nEventually as the century turns further generations benefit from said wealth &amp; get access to high powered jobs. \n\n\n\nTurns out....\nThere is no massive jewish conspiracy to control the economy or government, there is no secret Jew society manipulating things in the shadows. Its pure dumb luck, generational wealth, &amp; access to better opportunities that put them in positions of power like in banks or tv networks. Same nepotism happens with groups of rich people they're friends with, being Jewish is just a coincidence. Plenty of white, non-jewish families went thru the same generational wealth process, jews are seen as suspicious since they were outsiders &amp; challenged non-jews in the game of capitalism. Same non-jew families are christian and carry that \"omg you killed jesus\" rage with them. \n\nIslam is a branch of judeo-christianity so their shared hatred was just passed on as the religion evolved cuz of dead Jesus.\n\n\nTLDR: Persecution of jews is largely due to old world superstition &amp; religious mania.

I never thought it could get this bad that I'd be scapegoating all my problems onto muslims, women, and LGBT folk.\"\n\nOn a serious note Sargon is making a typical normie error.\n\nHe sees the Holocaust as an actual concrete event [when in fact it is used as a concept for Jewish suffering, it is the visible part of the iceberge for Jewish victimhood that includes all past pogroms and \"antisemitism\" and what not](http://i.magaimg.net/img/2w9n.png).\n\nThat's why the J-left threw an absolute fit when Poland asserted their own Holocaust suffering.\n\nThe J-left does not give a shit over non-jews who died.\n\n[Read this discussion I had over Jewish anti-polish racism in the Holocaust era](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/8v1gdf/i_guess_hes_complaining_too/e1kd1s5/).\n\nI pointed out that Poland was objectively, per capita, the least antisemitic/racist country in Europe at the time and that Poles actually suffered more at the hands of Anti-Polish Jews, than Jews suffered at the hands of Anti-Jewish Poles.\n\nThe Jewish supremacist commentor didn't give a shit about slaughtered Poles or Polish suffering. All Poles slaughtered by Jews were \"justified\".\n\n&gt;\"I can explain why the Jews did that. The reason is straightforward, during world war two **the Poles en mass did not protect their Jewish citizens from the Nazis in fact what they did was no only kill them, but directly handed them over and puroposuly turned the other cheek.** Following the inedited end of the war and the Holocaust, many thousands of displaced Jews had been killed by Poles (my family included), Jews who were looking to return home. If I were a Jew in 1945 and I went into hiding or a concentration camp because of my neighbours, **I would be pretty pissed off too. Poland, like the rest of Europe, was a land of antisemitism.**\"\n\nThey think the Russian Tsar and his family, [his CHILDREN being slaughtered was absolutely justified as well](http://magaimg.net/img/5pr7.jpg)\n\nIt's absolutely incredible how self-centered these hatefilled pieces of shit can be, and their kind of Ultra-racist hate is absolutely dangerous for any potential victims, any civilized society of any race of goyim who happen to be \"offensive\" to the Jewish-supremacist comissars\n\nThe target cold be a literal angel who did nothing but help others, it could even be a person of color\n\nI used to think Michael Jackson [was insane until I heard that he voiced complaint over this](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/nov/24/michaeljacksontrial.arts)\n\n&gt;Michael Jackson has been taped making overtly anti-semitic remarks during a phone call, describing Jews as \"leeches\" that conspired to leave him \"penniless\".\n\n&gt;\"They suck,\" said Jackson. \"I'm so tired of it ... they start out the most popular person in the world, make a lot of money. It's a conspiracy. Jews do it on purpose.\"\n\n&gt;National director of the anti-defamation league, Abraham Foxman, which campaigns against anti-semitism, said yesterday: \"It is sad that Jackson is infected with stereotypical ideas of Jews as money-grubbing and manipulative.\"\n\nOther people are fully woke on the \"Holocaustianity\" bullshit\n\nListen to what [Kanye West said on that interview where he got directly to the point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_M4LkYra5k)\n\n&gt;\"*We are mentally imprisoned... Cause slavery goes direct to the idea of blacks. It's like Slavery, Holocaust, Holocaust Jews. Slavery is blacks.*\"\n\nHe got so attacked for this interview but its remarkable no one pointed out that he fully recognized the \"critical race theory\" caste system with Jews at the top of human suffering.\n\n\nLuckily for all of humanity, their hatefilled extremist antics have gone too far to continue, the system by which they attack others is crumbling. It is still dangerous and can hurt people for the time being just like a dying hyena can wound people, but it is dying. \n\nDon't forget what [Assange himself said before being silenced](http://archive.fo/DCcvI):\n\n&gt;\"Would Sarkozy and Weinstein have fallen if\nHillary Clinton had been elected president?\nWas the prospect of her taking power\npreviously protective?

I'd like to think that most antisemitism ended in the 40s along with 6,000,000 of my people, but obviously that is not the case. My grandmother was a holocaust survivor (this is actually very common here) so alot of us grew up into that victim mentality, and the mantra of \"never again\" is what drives us to stand up straight, thrive and protect ourselves at all costs (by the way, our neighbours openly declare that we have no right to exist). That is why the media finds it so easy to portray us as the aggressors (everyone likes a good David-Goliath story, it sells; the more sensational and tragic - the better!) which couldn't be farther from the truth.\n\nSo please, try to also take whatever you hear about my country with a grain of salt, and to do your own research, as you've done here. You'll find that most of us are liberal, individualistic, open minded people (most of Israel is secular). Proof of that is the unprecedented number of startup companies and patents (with regards to the population) and one of the most thriving hi-tech ecosystems in the world. We're really just in a bad situation and a bad neibourhood, trying our best to survive (yes, it is hard to grasp for people living in huge countries, but just take a look at the map and see how small Israel is, its survival cannot be taken for granted).\n\nThing is that Jews always been the scapegoat of society whenever things got rough (my opinion is that the modern incarnation of this phenomona is Israel bashing, but one can claim that this is debateable). I also believe that to be the case with other ethnic/religious groups, with some more than the others.\n\nI'm aware that I am kind of contradicting myself by telling you  to do your own research while imposing my world views upon you. That is not the case: I'm sure you'll also take whatever I'm saying with a grain of salt, which is exactly what you should do, and what I would have done if I were you.\n\nAlso, please don't take it from my post that I inherently believe group identity is paramount. I don't. But the thing is that I LOOK extremely Jewish. And as long as there is a substantial amount of people who will view me as one everywhere I go, well, I gotta be realistic. In the 40's I would have been sent to the gas chambers regardless of my world views. So I gotta accept that my Jewishness is an unseparable part of my identity, but it is a part of it, it does not and will never define it.

He also championed a brand of anti-semitism that could only be thought up by a mind completely cut off from reality.\"[186] Donner took Fischer to a war museum, which \"left a great impression, since [Fischer] is not an evil person, and afterwards he was more restrained in his remarks\u2014to me, at least.\"\n\n&gt;From the 1980s on, Fischer's comments about Jews were a major theme in his public and private remarks.[472] He openly denied the Holocaust, and called the United States \"a farce controlled by dirty, hook-nosed, circumcised Jew bastards\".[473] Between 1999 and 2006, Fischer's primary means of communicating with the public was radio interviews. He participated in at least 34 such broadcasts, mostly with radio stations in the Philippines, but also in Hungary, Iceland, Colombia, and Russia. In 1999, he gave a radio call-in interview to a station in Budapest, Hungary, during which he described himself as the \"victim of an international Jewish conspiracy\".\n\nThe only way someone can be \"cured\" from being redpilled is if society changes to reduce/regulate Jewish supremacist oppression.\n\nThe alternative is that the person, unable to cope with reality (and unable to bullshit their way around the cold evil truth) goes completely insane and withdrawals entirely from the clown world we currently live in.\n\nI'm not saying this in a mean or condescending way either.

He made a name for himself by his deep study of medieval Jewry. His three-volumed Love, Work, and Death (subtitled Jewish Life in Medieval Umbria) is an encyclopaedia of this admittedly narrow area... \n\n&gt;In particular, he dwelt on the case of St Simon of Trent. This two-year old child from the Italian town of Trent was kidnapped by a few Ashkenazi Jews from his home on the eve of Passover 1475 AD.  At night, the kidnappers murdered the child; drew his blood, pierced his flesh with needles, crucified him head down calling \u201cSo may all Christians by land and sea perish\u201d, and thus they celebrated their Passover, an archaic ritual of outpouring blood and killed babies, in the most literal form, without usual metaphoric \u201cblood-wine\u201d shift.\n\n&gt;And now we come back to Dr Ariel Toaff. While going through the papers of the trial, he made a staggering discovery: instead of being dictated by the zealous investigators under torture, the confessions of the killers contained material totally unknown to the Italian churchmen or police. The killers belonged to the small and withdrawn Ashkenazi community, they practiced their own rites, quite different from those used by the native Italian Jews; these rites were faithfully reproduced in their confessions, though they were not known to the Crime Squad of the day. \u201cThese liturgical formulas in Hebrew with a strong anti-Christian tone cannot be projections of the judges who could not know these prayers, which didn't even belong to Italian rites but to the Ashkenazi tradition,\" Toaff wrote. A confession is of value only if it contains some true and verifiable details of the crime the police did not know of. This iron rule of criminal investigation was observed in Trent trials.\n\nThe typical Jewish \"debunk\" is that \"OMG we jews would never do that you stupid goys! Passover doesn't use blood!\"\n\nAnd YES OBVIOUSLY WE ALL KNOW THAT\n\nThe standard Jewish torah/talmud/zohar/whatever has no instruction on using human blood for anything, or anything resembling murder and human sacrifice\n\nWe all know that\n\nThese accused people were deviants, extremists\n\nAnd the larger Jewish community, since it is based on an ethno-religious principle (rather than purely religious) does NOT self-regulate/punish deviants and extremists\n\nThere are open [\"Jewish Satanists\"](http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-haunted-salem-a-jewish-church-founder-preaches-the-art-of-satanic-social-change/) who are NOT condemned by anyone\n\n&gt;For the 49-year-old Jarry, there is not much conflict between being Jewish and a Satanist.

{"archived": false, "author": "charmed_im-sure", "body": "Remember when we were at stage 1?\n\nThe Ten Stages of Genocide\n\nGenocide is a process that develops in ten stages that are predictable but not inexorable. At each stage, preventive measures can stop it. The process is not linear. Stages may occur simultaneously. Logically, later stages must be preceded by earlier stages. But all stages continue to operate throughout the process.\n\n1 - Classification: All cultures have categories to distinguish people into \u201cus and them\u201d by ethnicity, race, religion, or nationality: German and Jew, Hutu and Tutsi. Bipolar societies that lack mixed categories are the most likely to have genocide. The main preventive measure at this early stage is to develop universalistic institutions that transcend ethnic or racial divisions, that actively promote tolerance and understanding, and that promote classifications that transcend the divisions. \n\n 2 - Symbolization: We give names or other symbols to the classifications. We name people \u201cJews\u201d or \u201cGypsies,\u201d or distinguish them by colors or dress; and apply the symbols to members of groups. Classification and symbolization are universally human and do not necessarily result in genocide unless they lead to dehumanization. When combined with hatred, symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of pariah groups. \n\n3 - Discrmination: A dominant group uses law, custom, and political power to deny the rights of other groups. The powerless group may not be accorded full civil rights, voting rights, or even citizenship. The dominant group is driven by an exclusionary ideology that would deprive less powerful groups of their rights. The ideology advocates monopolization or expansion of power by the dominant group. It legitimizes the victimization of weaker groups. Advocates of exclusionary ideologies are often charismatic, expressing resentments of their followers, attracting support from the masses. \n\n4 - Dehumanization: One group denies the humanity of the other group. Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects or diseases. Dehumanization overcomes the normal human revulsion against murder. At this stage, hate propaganda in print and on hate radios is used to vilify the victim group. The majority group is taught to regard the other group as less than human, and even alien to their society. They are indoctrinated to believe that \u201cWe are better off without them.\u201d The powerless group can become so depersonalized that they are actually given numbers rather than names, as Jews were in the death camps. They are equated with filth, impurity, and immorality. Hate speech fills the propaganda of official radio, newspapers, and speeches.\n\n5 - Organization: Genocide is always organized, usually by the state, often using militias to provide deniability of state responsibility. (An example is the Sudanese government\u2019s support and arming of the Janjaweed in Darfur.) Sometimes organization is informal (Hindu mobs led by local RSS militants during Indian partition) or decentralized (jihadist terrorist groups.) Special army units or militias are often trained and armed. Arms are purchased by states and militias, often in violation of UN Arms Embargos, to facilitate acts of genocide. States organize secret police to spy on, arrest, torture, and murder people suspected of opposition to political leaders. Special training is given to murderous militias and special army killing units.\n\n6 - Polarization: Extremists drive the groups apart. Hate groups broadcast polarizing propaganda. Motivations for targeting a group are indoctrinated through mass media. Laws may forbid intermarriage or social interaction. Extremist terrorism targets moderates, intimidating and silencing the center. Moderates from the perpetrators\u2019 own group are most able to stop genocide, so are the first to be arrested and killed. Leaders in targeted groups are the next to be arrested and murdered. The dominant group passes emergency laws or decrees that grants them total power over the targeted group. The laws erode fundamental civil rights and liberties. Targeted groups are disarmed to make them incapable of self-defense, and to ensure that the dominant group has total control.\n\n7 - Preparation: Plans are made for genocidal killings. National or perpetrator group leaders plan the \u201cFinal Solution\u201d to the Jewish, Armenian, Tutsi or other targeted group \u201cquestion.\u201d They often use euphemisms to cloak their intentions, such as referring to their goals as \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d \u201cpurification,\u201d or \u201ccounter-terrorism.\u201d They build armies, buy weapons and train their troops and militias. They indoctrinate the populace with fear of the victim group. Leaders often claim that \u201cif we don\u2019t kill them, they will kill us,\u201d disguising genocide as self-defense. Acts of genocide are disguised as counter-insurgency if there is an ongoing armed conflict or civil war. There is a sudden increase in inflammatory rhetoric and hate propaganda with the objective of creating fear of the other group. Political processes such as peace accords that threaten the total dominance of the genocidal group or upcoming elections that may cost them their grip on total power may actually trigger genocide.\n\n Prevention of preparation may include arms embargoes and commissions to enforce them. It should include prosecution of incitement and conspiracy to commit genocide, both crimes under Article 3 of the Genocide Convention.\n\n**8 - Persecution: Victims are identified and separated out because of their ethnic or religious identity. Death lists are drawn up. In state sponsored genocide, members of victim groups may be forced to wear identifying symbols. Their property is often expropriated. Sometimes they are even segregated into ghettoes, deported into concentration camps, or confined to a famine-struck region and starved. They are deliberately deprived of resources such as water or food in order to slowly destroy them. Programs are implemented to prevent procreation through forced sterilization or abortions. Children are forcibly taken from their parents. The victim group\u2019s basic human rights become systematically abused through extrajudicial killings, torture and forced displacement.  Genocidal massacres begin. They are acts of genocide because they intentionally destroy part of a group. The perpetrators watch for whether such massacres meet any international reaction. If not, they realize that that the international community will again be bystanders and permit another genocide.** \n     \n**At this stage, a Genocide Emergency must be declared. If the political will of the great powers, regional alliances, or U.N. Security Council or the U.N. General Assembly can be mobilized, armed international intervention should be prepared, or heavy assistance provided to the victim group to prepare for its self-defense.** \n\n9 - Extermination: begins, and quickly becomes the mass killing legally called \u201cgenocide.\u201d It is \u201cextermination\u201d to the killers because they do not believe their victims to be fully human. When it is sponsored by the state, the armed forces often work with militias to do the killing. Sometimes the genocide results in revenge killings by groups against each other, creating the downward whirlpool-like cycle of bilateral genocide. \n \n10 - Denial: is the final stage that lasts throughout and always follows genocide. It is among the surest indicators of further genocidal massacres. The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves, burn the bodies, try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses. They deny that they committed any crimes, and often blame what happened on the victims. They block investigations of the crimes, and continue to govern until driven from power by force, when they flee into exile. There they remain with impunity, like Pol Pot or Idi Amin, unless they are captured and a tribunal is established to try them.\n\nref: http://genocidewatch.net/genocide-2/8-stages-of-genocide/", "score": 8, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "politics", "date_year_month": "2018-07", "created_utc_converted": "2018-07-15 10:26:49", "score_overall": 4, "words": "jew silencing jewish conspiracy", "shared_words": "jew silencing jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

I know as an alt-righter you're only capable of believing principles exist on the far-right, but yes, liberals have principles as well, and it's called \"inclusion\" or \"egalitarianism.\" Not allowing a minority religion to practice their religion is by definition exclusionary. I'm not sure what \"unrestricted immigration\" or holocaust laws have to do with inclusion, but they don't seem to have only jewish proponents.\n\n&gt; Go check the hate list on the ADL. They even edit it themselves that various people say nothing bad about jews...but they are on the list because they oppose Muslim immigration and/or criticize Islam.\n\nWow, you are being so incredibly dishonest. A \"hate list\" obviously doesn't have to include specifically jew-haters. You seriously can't understand this? Does a Jewish organization *always* have to *only* include anti-semitism as the definition of \"hate\"? It's called PRINCIPLES - in this case being against racism, bigotry, xenophobia, etc.\n\nI'll ask again, please give me an example of someone calling someone anti-semitic for opposing muslim immigration.\n\n&gt; It's funny that you are interested in protecting the rights of the minority muslims...but not the minority 'Neo nazis'. They are both minorities and based on a world view...the difference? One is killing jews...the other isn't.\n\nI'm not showcasing my opinion here, just presenting it to you in a more honest way than you seem to be capable of giving it. You seem to egregiously misunderstand everything regarding Jews and liberal belief to frame it in a way that conforms to your presuppositions that they are just anti-white and don't have any logic or principles of their own. This is exceedingly common in the alt-right and just shows incredible intellectual dishonesty.\n\nMuslim is a religion, neo-nazi is a political ideology. Do you not understand the different between religion and political ideology? Regardless if you want to argue that \"muslim\" is actually a political ideology in disguise as a religion, clearly most normal people view it as a religion, which is a protected class. So yes, there is a very legitimate, not conspiratorial jew-scheming anti-white reason to protect minority religion rights vs. a political ideology that many within it seek to explicitly take away human rights and ethnically cleanse large swaths of population.

Fascism means a centralization of power. At the head of this criminal agenda are the royals and nobles. The New World Order is a bloodline conspiracy at the top. They are ancient evil bloodlines that build and destroy empires for control through order out of chaos. The royal and noble houses are corporate entities and they claim to rule and own land, resources, and people. They authorize and finance bankers and businessmen to work for them through their corporate households. They authorize and issue the creation of laws, agencies, militaries, businesses, and universities. They create and run religions and secret societies. They also finance and own organized crime syndicates like they are business enterprises. Some top royal bloodlines include the Savoy, Bourbon, Medici, Glucksburg, Wittelsbach, Nassau-Weilberg, Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Romanov, Grimaldi, Orleans, Braganza, Habsburg, Hanover, Windsor, Saud, Thani, Khalifa, Alouwite, Hohenzollern, Orange-Nassau, Bonaparte, and Bernadotte families. Many royal bloodlines still rule their nations as heads of state like in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Monaco, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Morocco, Sweden, Norway, and Luxembourg. The Vatican City State is also a kingdom with the Pope of Rome as its monarch. The Black Nobility are the ancient bloodlines of the Papal States and they own and run the Holy See and Vatican. Black Nobility are considered sovereign princes. The Vatican is used as the centralized point of control and is one of the oldest continual corporate entities in existence. The Holy See is the \"All Seeing Eye\" and operates as an intelligence network which then works with intelligence agencies like the CIA, NSA, and MI6 to enhance their intelligence system. The Latin phrase Novus Ordo Seclorum means New Order of the Ages and is on the US dollar bill and US Great Seal. The Vatican uses Latin as an official language and for documents. America is named after Amerigo Vespucci and he was working for the Medici family of Florence and Rome. Vespucci created the term New World for America. Corporations are fraudulent constructs because they are considered a person with rights under law and because owners and controllers of corporations are enabled to bypass accountability for any crimes committed by the corporation. Corporations are not people and therefore cannot have rights. Corporations should not exist.\n\nRoyals and nobles issue charters establishing proxy corporations covertly owned and controlled by the corporate households or crowns of royals and nobles. They claim to own foreign governments this way. The royals and nobles claim to own the United States as a continuation of the Virginia Company. Holy Roman royalty like the Hanovers, Hesses, Hohenzollerns, Glucksburgs, Orange-Nassaus, and Saxe-Coburg and Gothas claim a portion of ownership over the British Crown. This is why the British royal family has so much German ancestry. The United States is defined as a federal corporation under US code 3002 section 15. Most of the founding fathers were Freemasons and working for the British Crown and German royals. The American political families like the Bushs, Clintons, Romneys, and Kennedys all take their name from still existing European nobles. The Bussche family are German nobles and relatives of the Bush family. The Clintons and Romneys are also British nobles. The Kennedys are Scottish-Irish nobles and an American political family involved with the Democratic Party. The Mars, Walton, Rockefeller, Guggenheim, Getty, Sackler, Sachs, Bussche, Johnson, and Cox are some American billionaire families working with royals and nobles in Europe. The Mars family are worth about 70 billion and work with the Windsor, Savoy, and Thurn and Taxis families. The Waltons are worth about 130 billion and work with German nobles like the Wurttemberg, Baden, Hohenzollern, and Isenberg families. The various Johnson families in the United States are collectively worth tens of billions and work as agents for the House of Hanover. They own Johnson and Johnson and Fidelity Investments. The Hanovers are powerful royalty and merchants that established the Hanseatic League. The Guggenheims have assets worth hundreds of billions and work with the House of Stuart. The Getty family are American billionaires and married in with the Italian House of Ruspoli. The Rockefeller family uses its charity foundations for financing gang stalking and bribes in the United States as well as globalization agendas like vaccinations programs. The Rockefeller Foundation also financed the Almighty Vice Lord Nation which is an organized crime group and financed the Tavistock Institute. Hollywood, the Church of Scientology, and Silicon Valley are US military and DARPA operations and managed by European royals and nobles like the Oettingen-Spielbergs, Schaumburg-Lippes, Anhalts, Hanovers, Windsors, Passi di Preposulos, Ruspolis, Torlonias, and Odescalchis. The House of Nassau-Weilberg which are married with the Torlonias finance human trafficking and human sacrifices in Hollywood. Idols in the entertainment industry are dangerous cult leaders that have access to weaponized electronics.\n\nThe Holy See is a corporate entity which issues laws and bills like the Golden Bull which claims ownership over the Kingdom of England. The Pope claims temporal power or ownership over the Earth and also claims Papal Supremacy or Papal Rule and Papal Infallibility. Archbishops are the overseers in society within their districts and they watch over politics, business, police, and organized crime. The European Monarchies function like extensions of Rome and they manage secret societies which infiltrate government agencies and run corporations for the monarchs. The Sovereign Military Order of Malta is the top military council and it works closely with the Orders of St. John run by Protestant royalty like the Windsors and Hohenzollerns. The royal and noble bloodlines are all working together as a global crime syndicate and part of a modernized Roman-Corporate Empire. They also have competing factions creating the illusion of division. The British Crown and the Scottish nobles like the Bruce, Stewart, Sinclair, Montagu, Scott, Percy, and Sutherland families manage Freemasonry. There are thousands of masonic lodges in the United States. Freemasonry should be outlawed. The Greek-German royal House of Glucksburg run the Greek fraternities and sororities and use initiates as their agents. The Glucksburgs and Italian nobles run the Boule Society which are fascist black supremacists and they work with black street gangs. Boule is a Greek fraternal society for African Americans. The Glucksburg family currently rule Denmark and Norway and recently ruled over Greece. Former Greek nobility and royal merchants like the Mavroleon, Onassis, and Niarchos families have a monopolies on the shipping industry and work with British Peers. The Greek merchant families are billionaires and human traffickers. The Greek royal family currently live in London. The British Crown authorized and control universities like Yale and Harvard and use them for recruiting Crown agents through fraternal orders like Skull and Bones. The royal and noble families also do covert business at the City of London Corporation which dominates the global markets and some top London merchant families include the Goldsmith, Stuart, Rothschild, Grosvenor, Sassoon, Barclay, Sutherland, Montagu, Bailey, and Guinness families. The Sutherland family created HSBC. The Stuart family are owners of Hudson's Bay Company and have an alliance with the Bavarian House of Wittelsbach which covertly owns some of HBC's subsidiaries. Royals and nobles need to be banned from entering America.\n\nThe Orange-Nassau family are influential merchants through their Netherlands Trading Society and have a large amount shares in Royal Dutch Shell, Philips Electronics, and ABN AMRO Bank. The Orange-Nassaus and their Dreyfus agents manage Rand Corporation which is in contract with the US military. The Orange-Nassau family also run the Masonic Loyal Order of Orange in Ireland which have infiltrated the police. The Nassau-Wielburg family of Luxembourg are international bankers connected with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The Ligne family of Belgium are wealthy diamond and gold merchants. The Belgian Crown is stealing wealth from the United States through fraudulent tax contracts established through the 1871 District of Columbia Organic Act. The Barons Strange run the Masonic Oddfellow Order and Daughters of Rebekah. The Russel family are the Marquises of Tavistock and manage the Tavistock Institute which is an organization involved in mass mind control. The Lewis family finance Tavistock agents with their Tavistock investment group. The Furstenberg family run the Royal Order of Jesters and have a Jester on their coat of arms. The Clintons work closely with the House of Furstenberg. The Italian Orsini family and Holy Roman Rosenberg family run the Rosicrucian Order of alchemists which infiltrate food and drug companies for chemical warfare. The Medici family which have a statue of Hermes at their palace in Rome manage the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn an alchemical secret society. The Pierleoni family of Rome and Spanish House of Bourbon run the Kabbalah Society which uses the Spanish lion of Leon for its logo. The Pacelli family of Rome and Crencenzi family of Italy manage Wiccan cults. The Bavarian Wittelsbach family of Bavaria created the Bavarian Illuminati and manage the Benedictine Monks and they also have part ownership over the Jewish Mafia in the United States which are white collar criminals.....Entire article here https://www.reddit.com/r/EndTheNewWorldOrder/comments/8y8mw4/new_world_fascism/", "score": 3, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "EndTheNewWorldOrder", "date_year_month": "2018-07", "created_utc_converted": "2018-07-17 07:24:55", "score_overall": 5, "words": "conspiracy merchant merchant illuminati jewish", "shared_words": "conspiracy merchant illuminati jewish", "socre_distint": 4}

You're clearly upset holocaust jokes, so before this conversation goes any further:\n\n1. Just Jew jokes and holocaust jokes are **not** the same.\n\n2.

For context, am a Jewish member of Labour &amp; have gone from defending corbyn on this to getting sick of this all.\n\nI think the earliest instance of this story started out with the \"Friends at Hamas\" audio clip that got out. We think it's antisemitic because it crosses a line past being diplomatic, and being 'friendly' with a group that in their party constitution, states that \"our\u00a0struggle against the Jews is very great and very serious\", and I think also at one point states they won't rest until our hearts are ripped from our bodies. (Can't find a source, you get the picture.) \n\nNext, came the Naz Shah incident. It was found she shared a Facebook post stating that the problems of the middle East would be solved if all Israelis would just move to Israel (a comic along those lines). While it wasn't hugely antisemitic, it was then discovered she had shared something worse, comparing Israel to the Nazis, a post stating \"The Jews are rallying\". That's antisemitism, and luckily it was dealt with. This wasn't quick at all I believe, and people criticised the party for the slow response.\n\nFollowing this post, along comes Ken Livingstone to defend her, just as the dust is settling. Ken says that she's not wrong, that the Jews tried to make a deal with Hitler and that Hitler was a Zionist. Ken, after some time was then suspended for this, and it's soon uncovered he's made more comics depicting Israelis as Nazis in the past which could be considered antisemitic. Ken, for two years was left suspended pending review, before resigning this year. (It's almost like he was making some sick joke that Hitler was a Zionist to some people, but it turns out that in a footnote of history, there was an effort made to send Jews to Madagascar in the 1930s) The antisemitism here to most people is:\n\n1. A comparison of Zionism, a largely Jewish held belief, to Naziism. We just want a homeland. We're not Nazis. If you're comparing our right to a safe homeland to Naziism, it looks like you think Jews don't deserve a homeland.\n2. The amount of time that was taken to act on this. It took one review a whole year, to come to the conclusion to do nothing and extend his suspension. It looked as if because Ken was on the side of the anti-zionist leadership, he could get away with making such a scandalous statement, or at least stick around for longer. \n\nCould you imagine if someone in UKIP said that the BLM movement is comparable to Naziism? And then was suspended after much debate, and held on review for two years? It looks like UKIP are happy to let something like that sit and wait, and not take any action. I understand it feels a little bit obscure, but look at it in detail and there are questions to be raised.\n\nThe next big scandal came about four months ago. Corbyn on Facebook had commented on a piece of artwork that was being taken down, questioning \"why?\". The artwork depicts the famous \"Jewish bankers controlling the world\" trope among other conspiracy nonsense. Corbyn 5y ago sees no issue with it and questions its removal. This is seen as antisemitic, directly because he has seen no issue and appears to tolerate this in artwork.\n\nThis sparked a protest in London, all while Ken was still suspended and no action had been taken. Many defend it as all being a \"smear\" on Jeremy, as if the controversy was fabricated, causing extra outrage. Corbyn eventually apologizes, and agrees to a talk with Jewish groups in the UK, and a review of antisemitism &amp; treatment of it.\n\nThe talk accomplished nothing, and Corbyn was accused of ignoring anything the community leaders suggested to him, including to sack Ken Livingstone.\n\nIn the Spring, Corbyn goes to a Seder for Passover with the Jewdas movement, who are staunchly anti Israel and pro Palestine. It was a  step in the right direction, but it shows him unwilling to face up to the real issues, picking and choosing who he wants to speak with, and not having any attempt to have dialogue with the people who were actually offended by the scandals.\n\nThis brings us up to this week with the NEC. The antisemitism review brought on a new suggestion of having a definition of antisemitism put into the rulebook to clarify things. There are two competing views:\nThe IHRA's (International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance) definition, which is strongly worded and has zero tolerance and is endorsed by the EU, among many others.\nThe Leadership's definition, which accepts some points of the IHRA, but then speaks about various points on Israel and Palestine and puts a bias on the Palestinian case.\n\nThe PLP votes on this, and almost unanimously backs the IHRA definition. 70 big-name Rabbis including chief Rabbis of several branches of Judaism all back the IHRA definition. The NEC subsequently decides to back their own definition of antisemitism against the will of Jews and the will of the party. \n\nWhy is this antisemitic? It looks like the NEC are so keen on furthering their own case against Israel and for the Palestinians, that they're willing to ignore the Jewish community, ignore their own party, and are okay to have a compromised definition of anti-Semitism to follow their belief. In essence, they think this is all about Israel and Palestine, not about real antisemitism, and are happy to ignore more of it to further their own case.\n\ntl;dr : Corbyn and the party keeps showing negligence to anti-Semitism and a failure to deal with it properly. We keep seeing it over and over again. I was happy to defend it at the start, it's been three years and they're behaving the same way as they were at the start.\n\nSorry about the ramble. I wanted to put everything out there so they you understand what we've been through.

Some of these examples are directly on Corbyn, others are antisemitic behaviour within the party, which as leader he should be responsible for disavowing and punishing (In nearly all cases he hasn't). \n\n1. Corbyn came to the defence of Sheikh Raed Salah, who revived the medieval anti-Semitic \u2018blood libel\u2019 slur that Jews cook with children\u2019s blood. Salah was arrested by British police in 2011 when he was due to speak at an event in the House of Commons \u2013 alongside Corbyn. In 2012 Corbyn called Salah \u2018a very honoured citizen\u2019.\n\n2. Labour Students at Oxford University Labour Club mocked the Jewish victims of the Paris kosher supermarket attack, called Auschwitz a \u2018cash cow\u2019, and used the Neo-Nazi slur \u2018Zio\u2019, according to extensive testimony from Jewish students. After months of obfuscation, including an NEC decision to not publish a party report that concluded there had been \u2018some incidents\u2019 of anti-Semitic behaviour, Labour\u2019s NEC decided not to discipline the key perpetrators.\n\n3. A Jewish Labour MP, Ruth Smeeth, was sent a 1,000 word death threat from a Corbyn-supporter calling her a \u2018yid c\u2013t\u2019. The threat followed Smeeth\u2019s decision to walk out of a meeting outlining Labour\u2019s response to anti-semitism because she was accused of working \u2018hand in hand with the right-wing media to attack Jeremy\u2019. Smeeth then received 20,000 abusive messages and has since questioned whether Labour is still \u2018a safe space for British Jews\u2019.\n\n4. A Labour council candidate in Peterborough, Alan Bull, shared anti-Semitic material online which claimed that the Holocaust was a \u2018hoax\u2019. The Labour party was made aware of the posts in 2017, but only suspended the candidate when contacted by the Jewish Chronicle in March 2018. Bull says he has never denied the Holocaust and re-posted the article in question to find out what his friends thought of it.\n\n5. Jeremy Corbyn was an active member of an \u2018anti-Semitic\u2019 Facebook group, \u2018Palestine Live\u2019. The group included Holocaust denial, 9/11 conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic slurs. He said he did not see the offensive posts and left in 2015.\n\n6. A former Labour parliamentary candidate in Witham, John Clarke, shared a Neo-Nazi meme saying the Rothschild family has used money lending and Israel to \u2018take over the world\u2019. He said the meme \u2018contained a great deal of truth\u2019 and was later suspended.\n\n7. Jeremy Corbyn had a ten-year association with a group which denied the Holocaust. Mr Corbyn was a \u2018stalwart\u2019 supporter of Deir Yassin Remembered, attending events in 2013, with the group\u2019s founder, Paul Eisen, a self-professed Holocaust denier.\n\n8. Jackie Walker, formerly vice-chair of Momentum, said Jews were the \u2018chief financiers of the sugar and slave trade\u2019, criticised security for Jewish schools, and said Holocaust Memorial Day was not \u2018inclusive\u2019 enough. After the comments were made and widely condemned, Corbyn shared a platform and campaigned alongside Walker.\n\n9. Jeremy Corbyn hosted an Islamic cleric in Parliament in 2009, who in 2006 wrote that \u2018Europe has made political correctness, the cult of the Holocaust and Jew-worshipping its alternative religion\u2019.\n\n10. Nasreen Khan, a Labour council candidate subsequently barred from standing, asked: \u2018What have the Jews done good in this world?\u2019. She said schools were \u2018brainwashing us and our children into thinking the bad guy was Hitler\u2019 and said \u2018Jews have reaped the rewards of playing victims\u2019.\n\n11. A Labour councillor in Birmingham, Zafar Iqbal, shared a David Duke video on Facebook entitled \u2018CNN Goldman Sachs and the Zio Matrix\u2019. The Labour party accepted Mr Iqbal\u2019s apology and claim that he had have no recollection of sharing this video\u2019 \u2013 no disciplinary proceedings were enacted.\n\n12. Two Jewish Labour councillors in Haringey resigned, saying it is impossible to be a Jewish Labour councillor due to overwhelming anti-Semitic abuse. Joe Goldberg and Natan Doron reported that \u2018many members have repeated to me assertions about Jews having big noses, controlling the media and being wealthy\u2019, and that a fellow councillor accused Goldberg of \u2018bagel-barrel politics\u2019. On his resignation, a Haringey Momentum activist tweeted to Goldberg: \u2018At least [you] will have more time to count your money.\u2019 Mr Goldberg said complaints he made to party officials were dismissed.\n\n13. Andrew Slack, a councillor in Chesterfield, was suspended after sharing an anti-Semitic meme of a blood-smeared, hook-nosed Israeli soldier. The meme said \u2018Israel was created by the Rothschilds\u2019.\n\n14. Bethany Barker, a student activist who introduced Jeremy Corbyn at a 2017 local elections campaign event, described a Kippah as a \u2018Jew cap\u2019 and said Andres Breivik, the Norwegian far-right terrorist, should \u2018get forced to live in a synagogue\u2019.\n\n15. Pam Bromley, a Labour Councillor in Lancashire, posted links to an antisemitic article entitled \u2018World War 3: Trump Begins Paying His Homage to Rothschilds,\u2019 commenting \u2018we must remember that Rothschilds are a powerful financial family (like the Medicis) and represent capitalism and big business\u2019. Bromley is still a Labour councillor and no disciplinary action has been taken.\n\n16. Ken Livingstone reportedly said a Jewish journalist was \u2018just like a concentration camp guard\u2019, that Jews vote Tory because they are rich and that Hitler supported Zionism. Despite his attempt to draw a parallel between those who fought for Jewish freedom and those who perpetrated a Jewish genocide, Livingstone was only given a temporary suspension from a party disciplinary panel \u2013 a decision Corbyn supported, despite 100 Labour MPs calling for Livingstone\u2019s expulsion.\n\n17. Terence Flanagan, a member of Hampstead and Kilburn CLP, compared a Jewish councillor to Josef Goebbels and, when calling for his expulsion, referred to former Labour donor Michael Foster allegedly as \u2018the Jewish millionaire\u2019.

The facts of Red Army amassing on the new border with Germany.\n\nNeither of which are necessarily indicative of an invasion. That massing was a catastrophic failure, by the way. Just like the invasion of Finland. That failed spectacularly against a much weaker foe than Germany.\n\nAnd \"socialism in one country\" was state policy, so what? Freedom of speech was guaranteed in the USSR constitution, did USSR have freedom of speech? Freedom of religion, yet Jews and Orthodox Christians and other religions and denominations were persecuted and oppressed. If we were to go by USSR's constitution, it would've been the most democratic country in the world.\n\nWhen was this invasion supposed to occur? Do you even know the mobilization figures for Nazi Germany and USSR? The USSR was lagging behind, badly, also Stalin purged the army's ranks.\n\nWhat if Stalin indeed wanted to invade? Does that excuse and justify Hitler exterminating millions and all the other atrocities and crimes by Nazi Germany? No, it does not. It's pretty obvious that if the Nazis were victorious, whole nationalities would have been wiped out.\n\n&gt;But he has. He brings tons of documents, all official from USSR.\n\nToo vague; citation needed. Why isn't this the consensus if he has evidence? When there is a scientific consensus, the onus of proof lies on those challenging the concensus. If they have proof, that'll become a new concensus. That hasn't happened for, what, 3 decades now since he's published his book.\n\n&gt;The why did he signed a treaty with USSR? Could it be because he needed to buy time to prepare?\n\nHe was kind of busy invading the rest of Europe... You know, invading and weakening the very same nations that would've banded against the supposed Soviet invasion, just like Finland did. If Hitler knew, when did he know of the invasion? Before 1939? How? Stalin knew the Japanese weren't going to invade the USSR thanks to a spy, this is common knowledge, how did Hitler know Stalin was going to invade? Why didn't he present this proof to European countries instead of weakening them? In fact, we can say Hitler is largely responsible for the domination of much of Europe by USSR by his gamble to invade USSR; he failed spectacularly (thanks in part to the failure of his intelligence agencies).\n\n&gt;Extermination of Jews was not the original goal, Nazis were fine with Jews leaving, as long as they left their property. The problem was that nobody wanted to take them.\n\nThere is actually a debate about this issue known as the functionalist versus intentionalism Holocaust debate between historians. Yours is a functionalist position.\n\nHitler talked to a journalist about hanging every Jew in Munich as far back as 1924 and leaving them on the gallows until they start to \"stink\". He wrote about Lebensraum in Mein Kampf as far back as 1925. He wrote about using gas to poison Jews in Mein Kampf. The Nazi plan for Jews to emigrate to Madagascar was not practical; Madagascar couldn't have supported 100,000 Jews, let alone four times that number (population of Jews in Germany) or what, 10-12 million Jews of Europe.\n\nWhatever the plan was, he stripped Jews of rights and robbed them, just like he plundered the nations of Europe. Hitler worked towards his own-selfish goals and pseudo-scientific ideas. And whatever the plan was, it came about thanks to his beliefs.\n\nHitler invaded because the Germans supposedly needed living space, because he perceived USSR to be dominated by Jews (ironic, considering communist leadership also apparently believed in a worldwide Jewish conspiracy) and because he desperately wanted resources. He talked about the extermination of Jews in a Reichstag speech in 1939 (8 months before the invasion of Poland). He talked of the extermination of Poles in Obersalzberg before the invasion of Poland. He knew of the Armenian genocide and how it was conducted as far back as the 1920s - the Nazi party member who was shot in front of him in the Beer Putsch and whose resulting fall broke Hitler's arm was a vice counsul in Turkey who had first-hand, intimate knowledge and experience of Armenian genocide and how it was conducted.\n\nOccam's razor. No need to cook up conspiracy theories or cherry pick a single source that supports your claims.\n\n&gt;Stalin's plan to invade Germany on specific day, we only have circumstantial evidence, but to me - it seems enough to assume with some certainty that there was a long term plan.\n\nAs I said, arguments are not enough, you need evidence.\n\nUnited States has contingency plans about invading just about any country in the world. Does that mean they're going to do it? Just because there's some plan doesn't mean it's actually going to come true.\n\n&gt;The end result was the best outcome for Stalin even with Hitler's surprise: by 1945 he has the whole country under his full control, he used the war to eliminate whole ethnicities, he controls half Europe, he got Americans to supply his army.\n\nWhat ethnicities did Stalin specifically eliminate?\n\n&gt;Winners get to write the history, which is normal, but I believe that Stalin was just as horrible dictator as Hitler, if not more so, he came out winner, and USSR and maybe the whole world lucked out that he died when he did, and there was no one to carry on his legacy.\n\nRed herring, irrelevant and untrue. Much of what we know about WW2 comes from Nazi and German sources, after all, 60+ million Germans survived the war.\n\nHitler made a whole industry out of genocide - no one has done that before or after him, and that's why I think he was worse.\n", "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "worldnews", "date_year_month": "2018-07", "created_utc_converted": "2018-07-19 01:49:43", "score_overall": 5, "words": "holocaust jew jewish conspiracy conspiracy", "shared_words": "holocaust jew jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}
{"archived": false, "author": "WhenSnowDies", "body": "The real answer to your implicit question of why it doesn't count, and it'll probably be unwelcome regardless of my saying what I think is right, is this:\n\nBecause when it happened to European Jews it was based on Zionist conspiracy propaganda put on by an artificial state, Deutschland (lit. \"German Land\"), because pride propaganda and appealing to imaginary ethnic groups (like Aryans) with your political rivals (Jews) is cheap governing. It's fascism. There was no Zionist conspiracy.\n\nWhen Israel does fascist shit in the Middle East, the ethnic Arabs are actually only targets because they're Muslim, which means they're potentially part of an actual religious and military order that informally answers to ultra-conservative factions in Arabia that literally desire world domination, and to destroy the Jewish state. The European Jews were only *accused* of this conspiracy against Deutschland, and weren't actually trying to destroy the German state (but, perhaps, the new concepts of brand racism (Aryans, whites, Asians, Latinos, Russians, red Chinese, North Koreans, and other state-created broad ethnic groups of impossible size for such hegemony on their history (without purges and ethnic cleansing, that is))).\n\nSo basically it'd be like if Protestant Christians were trying to siege Israel and Jerusalem, and Israel were being accused of hating whites and being Nazis. The motivations of the Muslim minority in this case (but regional and planetary supermajority, rivaling entire races) is religious, and since Jews are both a religion and an ethnic group technically, the conflict only *superficially* appears racist. It's actually ideological and religious, which is a natural conflict, and can be resolved with ordinary peace structures (republics, representation, etc.) as soon as paramilitary fascist Klans (terrorists) are dismantled.\n\n**On propagandistic terms like \"terrorist\".**\n\nPropagandistic terms like \"terrorist\" are used as counter-propaganda, because obviously the terrorists are only *using* Muslim forms and themes to recruit for their very modern military objectives. Therefore they need to be denied their Muslim affiliation and goals in the propaganda itself, and to be identified for what their actual political aims are: To use a protection racket (terrorism) aimed at Muslims, actually, to create a fascist Caliphate. They wish to agitate the public against Muslims so that Muslims have to turn towards the Klans. Meanwhile the terrorism itself is about ethnic cleansing and gaining territory. That's why they blow up monuments, they're Nazi Muslims.\n\nAnd yes, the real political situation is way more intense and interesting than it seems and actually had a Sultan Hitler in Osama Bin Laden. The only reason we don't know this is because the American Government doesn't play up the comparisons to distance itself from formal, non-reactionary and not-completely-necessary propaganda. However Bin Laden was absolutely a Muslim fascist bent on a holocaust and to turn the world into a themepark for Muslims and a man-farm for everybody else. He was just a desert Hitler in his motivations. Osama Bin Laden was a television character meant to be the mascot as the ideal jihadist, but actually he was an aristocrat. He was a Muslim fascist.\n\nFascism is just a capability that industrialization brought with it, and we have to purge it like a virus.\n\nAnyway the Left Wing elements that have an issue with Israel are the same organizations that formerly had an issue when Zionism was the stuff of racist conspiracy theories. Now that Zionism has been deployed as an *actual* method to undue Hitler's cultic propaganda (which is why he killed Jews, for his Thousand Year Reich cult, for which he had a breathtaking postwar temple to himself planned for Berlin) in the postwar period, former racist and fascist groups can now become *sympathetic* groups and point to a realer-seeming \"Jew problem\", which is what they do.\n\nHowever the cultural purpose of Israel was to prevent Hitler's propaganda war from ethnically cleansing the Earth with fascist ideologies, like the idea that you can farm people and that religions and culture are actually meaningless, and you can run 1984-style states like the colonies, German Empire, Imperial Japan, USSR, red China, and American South intended to do. This trend in world politics is actually something like a virus, and it infected the hippy movement actually (they basically thought they were a sort of master culture) and can look quite positive and visionary (that's why everybody gets behind it). Meanwhile Israel is actually the British Empire's final move as a formal colonial empire, to instead of ignorantly wiping out host cultures, to make history and return the Jews to the Promised Land in an Earth-shattering humanitarian act of good faith. In this, the Americans also hoped to stop planetary-scale Nazi religious propaganda in the death camps, put the leaders on trial as war criminals, and to show world religions (Christianity mostly, but including Islam) that law, order, and tradition lives. This is in the Renaissance/Mediterranean \"New World\" tradition based on world history, alive mainly in France, the United States, and American colonies in Asia (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, etc.).\n\n**The Problem of Israel**\n\nThe difficulty, because Israel is *regionally* an artificial state, is to introduce the world situation to Muslims and show that Israel is a New World nation and not a fascist state. This is a hard sell because of illiteracy, causing Israel's appearance to lack context as a very space-age fascist state, since people in the region lack a planetary perspective of world history. Therefore many people in the region feel, in their gut, that Israel popped out of nowhere and doesn't have a legitimate modern or ancient history. They believe that the Holocaust didn't actually happen and was *complete* propaganda (which is why Islam is so idealistic about human nature, and the New World/Western Europe so nihilistic), mostly because pre-war antisemitic literature was propagated to the Middle East by the Nazis in preparation for ruling the world on pride propaganda (in the case of the Middle East, Hitler would have saved them from the imaginary Zionist threat, which Britain and the US made real on purpose (to update Islam on the world situation)).\n\nWe're in a Propaganda War, folks. The 19th Century onward is legitimate states, cultures, and entities versus corporate and Brand ones, as well as paying for the colonies and a world refugee crisis. The question isn't who's right or wrong, but who's a Brand and who's an actual culture.\n\nPalestinians, unfortunately, are actually borrowed from ancient Roman propaganda aimed at demoralizing Israelites. Basically, Rome renamed Israel \"Palestine\" after their ancient enemy, the Philistines, to depict Israel as an illegitimate and basically fascist state. This is (from an historic perspective) agreed to have been done for political and not sincere regional purposes, which is why the \"Palestinian\" today is understood to be an antagonistic ethnic group by the Jews.\n\nIf Muslim fascism isn't the bad guy here, they wouldn't call them Palestinians. Meanwhile New World and Western European powers refer to the people as Israelis and not Israelites, so as to not be propagandistic and inflammatory. It would be so easy, so easy for the United States to encourage Protestants to add the return of the Jews to Israel by the hands of Uncle Sam to The Bible. Basically they don't do this, and most Christians have the encouraged \"last days\" view, not the ideal \"millennial age\" view of Temple rebuilding.\n\nSo anywhoo that's closer to the actual situation and why the Israelis appear fascistic: They're being put in situations that mirror historic fascism deliberately, by fascistic entities. However if Israel was fascistic, it'd be *modern* fascism, which looks much different from 19th Century racism because Israel is on a different tier of technology with different capabilities and alliances than world War II Germany.\n\nDownvote away!", "score": 0, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "worldnews", "date_year_month": "2018-07", "created_utc_converted": "2018-07-19 12:53:47", "score_overall": 8, "words": "conspiracy conspiracy jewish conspiracy holocaust conspiracy jew holocaust", "shared_words": "conspiracy jewish holocaust jew", "socre_distint": 4}

{"archived": false, "author": "cylinderhead", "body": "I had dozens of conversations last week with Hungarian Jews on anti-Semitism. The overwhelming majority of those I met in Budapest are convinced that Prime Minister Viktor Orban, visiting Israel this week, has been appealing to the anti-Semitic instincts of Hungarian nationalist voters.\n\nThey see it in the way his government has sanitized and venerated the record of the fascist Horthy regime and in the nation-wide smear campaign against the \"global capitalist\" Holocaust survivor George Soros which has been going for nearly three years.\n\nBut at the same time they have been at pains to emphasize that \"personally\" they feel perfectly safe as Jews in Hungary. Anti-Semitic incidents are down and the media, regulated by the government, has largely been cleansed from the once prevalent negative references to Jews. The only overt anti-Semitism they encounter is usually in the shape of non-politically-correct and ignorant remarks.\n\nBut the majority of Jews in Hungary, and the official leadership of the community, still believes that the government-funded anti-Soros campaign blatantly uses anti-Semitic imagery and their requests that it be stopped have been repeatedly ignored. So has anti-Semitism under Orban got worse or better?\n\nI constantly find myself asking the same question about Britain, the country of my birth. These things weren\u2019t measured when I was a kid there in the late 1970s and early 80s, but I remember a great deal of anti-Semitic graffiti and vandalism, even in the Jewish neighborhood where we lived, and across the country there was more violence from the fascist hard-right, and anti-Semitic chants were the norm at football matches. It hasn\u2019t disappeared - but it\u2019s no where near as bad nowadays.\n\nBut in the last three years, since Jeremy Corbyn was elected the leader of the Labour Party, barely a week goes by without another anti-Semitic scandal at the heart of Britain\u2019s largest (in terms of numbers of paid-up members) political party.\n\nThere have been two kinds of scandals. Either it has been party members, of all levels, coming out with the most odious statements about Jews, sometimes only barely veiled by using the words \"Zionists,\" \"bankers\" and \"the lobby.\" There was one thing all those members had in common - they were all diehard supporters of Corbyn.\n\nThe other kind of incident were the periodic revelations of Corbyn\u2019s own participation in events with Jew-haters and Holocaust-revisionists, his support of them (sometimes tempered with his excuse that \"I knew they did good work, I wasn\u2019t aware of other things they said,\") and his membership of real-life and online groups where anti-Semitic statements were routinely aired.\n\n\nI\u2019ve never quite been able to work out whether Corbyn is an anti-Semite himself. But this week, Margaret Hodge, a veteran Labour parliamentarian and party member of fifty years\u2019 standing called him \"a fucking anti-Semite and racist\" to his face. The normally mild-mannered Hodge has known Corbyn as a colleague throughout his political career, so I think we should maybe take her word for it.\n\nThe reason for Hodge\u2019s outburst was the decision by Labour\u2019s National Executive Council, dominated by Corbyn and his supporters, to reject the International Holocaust Remembrance Authority\u2019s (IHRA) official definition of anti-Semitism and adopt instead guidelines favored by the hard-left of the party.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m not a huge fan of defining anti-Semitism. I think I know what it is when I see it. You can go online and read elsewhere about the various merits and flaws of the IHRA definition.\n\nBut what you need to know right now is that the IHRA definition has been adopted by successive British governments, and more important, the British legal system and the overwhelming majority of British Jewish organizations and communities.\n\nThis week, an unprecedented list of 68 prominent British rabbis, spanning the range from female progressives to Hasidic ultra-Orthodox, signed a letter beseeching Labour to adopt the IHRA definition. But Corbyn\u2019s team refused.\n\nSo the British Labour Party now officially allows within its ranks anti-Semites who could be prosecuted by the authorities. And it is now the second major political party in Europe, along with Orban\u2019s Fidesz, to reject the definition of anti-Semitism as understood by the very people it is directed against, the local Jewish community.\n\nI\u2019m really not sure how best to define anti-Semitism. It\u2019s the most ancient hatred which has proved extremely adept in evolving to life in the feverish conspiracy theory marshes of the internet. It\u2019s the template for all hatred towards minorities but also unique in the way it sees Jews as both inferior and all-powerful.\n\nAnti-Semitism is both the socialism of fools and the most evil form of nationalism. Which is why those on the both the far-left and far-right are particularly susceptible to it. And it can masquerade equally as being, \"Just criticism of Israel\" and as, \"How can you call me an anti-Semite, I love Israel?\"\n\nSupporters of Orban, including some Jews like Netanyahu, strenuously deny he is anti-Semite. They point to his support for Israel (not exactly Israel, more like Netanyahu\u2019s policies) and insist that Soros, while being Jewish, is a malicious influence on global politics and that there is nothing anti-Semitic about the campaign against him.\n\nSimilarly, Corbyn has his Jewish supporters, who are convinced that a man who claims to have fought racism all his life (racism for Corbyn has usually consisted of the policies of western and western-supported governments; he\u2019s blind to racism in regimes with which he\u2019s more sympathetic), can not be considered an anti-Semite.\n\nAs a journalist and freedom-of-speech fanatic, I don\u2019t want anyone else defining for me what is or isn\u2019t anti-Semitism. But political leaders and parties need to be held to definitions and the one rule they have to abide by is anti-Semitism-is-whatever-most-of-its-potential-targets-and-victims-say-it-is. Orban and Corbyn refuse to do so.\n\nWho is worse? Orban or Corbyn? I don\u2019t know what either of them actually feel in their heart and mind towards Jews, but both are certainly enablers of anti-Semitism.\n\nFrom all available evidence, Corbyn is a stupid anti-Semite. Blinkered by his outdated dogma from perceiving it among his allies, and within the hateful environment in which he has been immersed his entire adult life. He has convinced himself it is all legitimate anti-capitalism, anti-Zionism and anti-imperialism.\n\nOrban, on the other hand, is a clever anti-Semite.

I will address the few things we don't agree on and make clear others. \n\n\n&gt;I happen to come from the UK, and I disagree with having a monarch, let alone having the Head of State be by necessity the head of the state church. All types of ethno-states are bad in my opinion, because they can lead very quickly to racial bias and enable dangerous far-right policies to rise. (See: English Defense League, UKIP)\n\nI can understand that. I actually use to hold the same views as an Israeli. It was hard to see what good comes from basing a country as such. However, my point is that Israel is small and exists in the context of the world which these ethnic and religious based countries exist.\n\nTaking that as a fact, there's nothing special or wrong in having Israel also being a country like that. And I do believe as a Jew that not enough time has passed and not enough has changed in the world for Jews to not have their own country and own right for self defense.\n\nMy grandmother is a Holocaust survivor and she's still alive today in Israel. All her family killed by Nazis. Majority of Israelis still carry around this memory and we can't accept not being responsible for our own safety yet. It will take a while.\n\nOn the long run, you might be right. I hope so.\n\n\n&gt;Is it necessary? I don't think so; my basis is the African-American population in the USA, and how they have gained rights to live in a multicultural society (albeit a somewhat flawed example).\n\nIt's a good example. Maybe with time Jews can see the change in the world as constant and for good. But remember the Holocaust was only 70 years ago and the US civil war more than 150 years. Of course blacks in the US were and still and are opressed at some degree.\n\nHere's a key difference: blacks in America live in a country with no ethnic or religious affiliation while Israel is based on (European), and surrounded by, countries with clear ethnic and religious affiliation. Jews are not welcome anywhere close to Israel (and they were kicked out of quite a few).\n\nWe Israelis see ourselves able to live in America just fine, but not everyone can or want to move. We are amongst nations that have 99% homogeneous ethical or religious groups.\n\n&gt;Is the Jewish case unique to the extent that it requires a nation-state to prevent another Holocaust? I do not think so. \n\nSo I do - in the world as of today and given where Israel is. This might change with time.\n\n\n\n&gt;I am using their encroachment as an example of gradual descent into an oppressive situation, although I understand that the situation is more complex than that.\n\nI understand that and I agree with the dangerous direction my country is going.\n\n&gt;In my mind, the idea that\n&gt;&gt;Israel is not a threat to Palestinian citizens\n&gt;\n&gt;is not true. \n&gt;\n&gt;Gradually more oppressive policies in dealing with Palestinian citizens such as taking control of Jerusalem and removing their self-determination separately from Israel proper has shown the willingness of the state to encroach upon the rights of Palestinian citizens.\n\nI think you didn't notice my point was about Palestinian citizens only. These are Israeli citizens with full rights in Israel or Jerusalem and they are completely equal by law and there is no threat today or in the foreseeable future for them.\n\nWest Bank Palestinians are not citizens of Israel and a lot of East Jerusalem Palestinians aren't either because they refused to get citizenship when Israel annexed the East side.\n\n\n&gt;This is more subjective, but I would still hold that - for two reasons - Israel is a threat to its minorities.\n&gt;\n&gt;First, Israeli domestic politics is already shifting rightwards, in the direction of fascism/ethno-nationalism. Netanyahu seems to buy into several conspiracy theories about Iran's nuclear capabilities, for example. \n\nHere I don't agree. Israel is moving right, yes, but I don't see any danger for minorities (citizens) in Israel. All the basic laws protect them, there is no discussion on taking away any of their rights, they are equal in front of the law and they are being more and more part of the state. The Druze for example are almost completely integrated into Israeli society. Arab Christians are progressing slowly. Arab Muslims still have a long way to go, of course.\n\nRegarding Iran I think it's a bad example because sadly I think Iran is actually conspiring to destroy Israel. There are plenty of evidence for that if you want to get into it. The Iran nuclear agreement is a bad deal for Israel because it denied the world access to Iran's military facilities and there is no reason to trust Iran to not progress it's nuclear program and plenty of evidence to not trust them. [Here's a former CIA guy explaining.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7SV9eRoaNyc#).\n\n\nI would agree that Israel is treating Palestinians in the West Bank horribly.

It's why far leftist anti semites also like to make the link to Jews controlling the funding of African slavery - and now introducing apartheid, where on the most fundamental of levels, Israeli Arab citizens are clearly not being subject to that - its fake news, pure and simple. \n\nLivingstone took all this to new levels - a rhetorical device to refuse to engage with the charge made of a dishonest dishonest Jewish (styled as \"Zionist\") conspiracy. He conflates everything and accuses people who raise the issue of antisemitism of being wrong on purpose. \n\nThe JVL point is that Jews are often told we only value the opinion of the \"right type of jew\" i.e. not Lansman, of the JVL guys. This is untrue but also silly because they represent a tiny proportion of our community - their membership numbers are hellishly tricky to come by and the same people keep cropping up, hence my (perhaps unfunny) reference to disguises...\n\nAnyway, hope this helps. \n\nI'm not an Israel apologist, or a right winger - I hate Trump and feel is approach to the middle east is (as with so many of his policies) spectacularly misguided.

During the George W. Bush years, the magic word was \u201cneocon.\u201d For years, it was used as a term of abuse by the Left; later, it was adopted as a term of abuse by some elements of the Right. What they had in common is that neither camp had the faintest idea of what the word meant.\n\n&gt;\u201cNeoconservative\u201d was first brought to popular usage in the American context by left-wing intellectuals (the socialist Michael Harrington most prominent among them) to describe the thinking of a few critics of American progressivism and the American Left \u2014 especially Irving Kristol and Daniel Patrick Moynihan \u2014 who didn\u2019t smell like conservatives. The classical conservative \u2014 the cartoon conservative \u2014 was Babbitt, a Midwestern businessman who was Republican, conformist, and, above all, anti-intellectual. Kristol was a Jewish intellectual from New York and a former Trotskyist; Moynihan was a Kennedy confidante, a diplomat, and, eventually, a Democratic senator. The neoconservatives, in essence, were those who began criticizing progressivism from within. Eventually Irving Kristol and Norman Podhoretz, among others, would embrace the label.\n\n&gt;There were and are many prominent Jewish neoconservatives, and as the neocons turned their attention more intensely to foreign policy and the Middle East in the post-9/11 era, **the word \u201cneocon\u201d acted as a kind of catalyst enabling a political reaction that revived a great many stupid and ugly myths about Jewish bankers orchestrating wars for profit, and so by 2005 or so, \u201cneocon\u201d in the mouth of a man of the Left came to mean \u201cJew with politics I don\u2019t like.\u201d** Google what\u2019s been written about my friend Jonah Goldberg for a taste of that sort of thinking.\n\n&gt;Before the neocons were the neocons, they were in more fanciful minds \u201cthe Illuminati.\u201d For Henry Ford, the neocon was \u201cthe international Jew.\u201d (The Stalinists called them \u201crootless cosmopolitans,\u201d a term recently revived by Donald Trump enthusiasts.) **The idea is always the same: that somebody, somewhere, is operating secretly behind the scenes, that there is a covert, monolithic enemy pulling the strings of history in ways that are obscure to the uninitiated. The reality of George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cdemocracy project\u201d program for the Middle East \u2014 to bomb the Arabs until they became Canadians \u2014 just wasn\u2019t crazy enough for his critics. There needed to be something more**.\n\n&gt;But it is a complicated family tree. The neocons used to be the Illuminati, but then, so did the new favorite conservative bugbear: the Deep State.\n\n&gt;On Wednesday, Sean Hannity spent a portion of his radio program raving about the \u201cDeep State\u201d and the \u201cshadow government\u201d that purportedly is maneuvering against President Trump. Hannity went so far as to suggest that the hacking and phishing shenanigans conducted against the DNC weren\u2019t the work of foreign hackers at all but rather might have been (conspiracy theorists love the \u201cIs it possible?\u201d formulation) perpetrated by American intelligence agencies. No, that does not make sense as a conspiracy theory (undermine Hillary Rodham Clinton and help elect Donald Trump so that you can . . . covertly oppose him?), but the Right\u2019s talking heads stopped making sense a long time ago. On Thursday, Rush Limbaugh insisted that the New York Times account of the investigation into possible links between Trump associates and the Russians was based on \u201cDeep State sources.\u201d In case it is not clear enough, Limbaugh published an article headlined: \u201cBarack Obama and His Deep State Operatives Are Attempting to Sabotage the Duly Elected President of the United States.\u201d Wreckers and saboteurs! If only there were some kulaks around to liquidate as a class!\n\n&gt;\u201cDeep State\u201d is a term that has been around for a while, often being used to describe extralegal political action in authoritarian regimes, especially in Turkey. **The \u201cDeep State\u201d became a favorite conspiracy villain of the American Left, who described it as a nexus between the military, militarized law-enforcement agencies, the intelligence community, Wall Street (of course), and a few powerful political and business figures. An invisible enemy is very handy for the Left: It could not possibly be socialism that has reduced Venezuela to its current condition \u2014 it must be Goldman Sachs colluding with the CIA**. The \u201cDeep State\u201d is sometimes conflated with what the political theorist (and, later in life, outright kook) Sam Francis called the \u201cpermanent government,\u201d the bureaucrats and apparatchiks and such who remain in power irrespective of the outcome of any given election. **They were a lot less scary back when they were \u201cthe civil service.\u201d**\n\n&gt;\u201cDeep State\u201d and \u201cpermanent government\u201d of course refer to real things. The federal government really does have employees, and those employees do not change every time the composition of Congress changes, every time there is a presidential election, or every time there is a change in policy. And as we have seen everywhere from the LAPD to the IRS, government agents have interests of their own \u2014 political and economic \u2014 and will, from time to time, go to extraordinary and even criminal lengths to frustrate the intent of the people\u2019s elected representatives, to flout policy, to undermine real or perceived opponents, etc. That\u2019s what Mrs. Clinton\u2019s e-mail shenanigans were really about: The chief bureaucrat in the State Department had (and, I suppose, has) political ambitions, and she was willing to go to great lengths to avoid ordinary oversight in order to pursue those ambitions.\n\n&gt;It isn\u2019t the \u2018Deep State\u2019 that is making President Donald Trump look like an amateur. It is amateurism.\n\n&gt;Where the current critics on the right go wrong \u2014 **where they veer from criticism into conspiracy theory \u2014 *is in assuming that the aims and ambitions of the various power centers within the federal bureaucracy are identical or aligned, that they represent a monolithic interest group that is both capable of coordinating efforts across the vast federal apparatus and inclined to do so*. That creates exactly what the kooks and quacks and demagogues of the world most need: a nice, vague enemy that can be blamed for practically anything**.\n\n&gt;It is not the \u201cDeep State\u201d that prevents, say, serious reform of the financial-services industry. If you want to understand why Wall Street reform seems so difficult, you should begin by considering the fact that Wall Street\u2019s most energetic critics do not understand what Wall Street does and have no interest in taking the time to learn. The most concrete banking-reform measure Bernie Sanders ever proposed before the financial crisis was a cap on ATM fees. You don\u2019t need a \u201cDeep State\u201d to outmaneuver enemies like that. Bernie Sanders couldn\u2019t outmaneuver Mr. Magoo.\n\n&gt;Watching Barack Obama careering around Syria policy was enough to make one wish there were some highly capable men in black behind the scenes pushing him in the right direction \u2014 they could hardly have done worse.\n\n&gt;**Neocons, globalists, the Deep State, the shadow government, the International Jew, the Illuminati \u2014 it is nice to have someone to blame, especially if that someone does not exactly exist**.\n\n\n\n[The Era of Distortion](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/06/opinion/the-era-of-distortion.html)\n&gt;Still, there are apparently millions of people who cling to the notion that the world is controlled by well-organized and malevolent forces.

{"archived": false, "author": "generalblie", "body": "A few points - I am willing to discuss any of the individual quotes in the article you linked to.  \n\nBut First, the majority of the quotes are not from the Talmud, but from other sources.  Many of which I am unfamiliar with, so I suspect they are not widely accepted.\n\nSecond, many of the quotes are taken seriously out of context (For example, a girl under 3 who has sex is still considered a virgin.  He interprets this as the Talmud allows a man to sleep with a girl under 3, when the Talmud clearly does not allow it. Rather the passage is discussing whether a husband when she is older can claim she is not a virgin and deny her the greater marriage dowry that a virgin is entitled to.)\n\nThird, many of the claims are based on mis-translations.  He states that Goy is a derogatory term used in the bible/Talmud for Gentile.  It is not.  Goy means nation.  The Jewish nation is referred to in the Bible many times as Goy Kadosh (lit. Holy Nation).  Goy and Goyim in the Bible/Talmud simply refers to other nations.  Also, he uses Gentile and Idolaterer interchaneably to mean non-Jew, when idolater has a more specific meaning in the Bible/Talmud (and technically can also refer to Jews).\n\nFourth, it lacks an understanding of the basic structure of the Talmudic discourse.  The structure is a back and forth dialogue between groups of Rabbis.  Normally, a contention is proposed, it is argued and debated, and then a conclusion may (or may not be reached).  For example, he quotes \"Rabbi Yochanan says \"A heathen who studies the Torah deserves death\".  He even includes the entire responsa back and forth which refutes this contention and comes to a conclusion that a non-Jew who studies the Torah is equated with the High Priest.  You see this frequently in objections to the Talmud.  The initial conjectures are often discarded by the Talmud themselves and, in some cases, are proposed to stimulate debate (play devil's advocate).  You must go by the conclusions.\n\nFinally, if you want a source from an actual Jewish Rabbinic scholar with sourcing from the original Hebrew and Aramaic, see here. (http://www.angelfire.com/mt/talmud/).  This is much more faithful to mainstream Jewish interpretation of the Talmud.  I don't think relying on 15 or so quotes (fyi... the Tamud is 2700+ pages in the original aramaic) is a valid source.  Even you admit it is biased.  Better to rely on Jewish Talmudic scholars who have 1) actually gone through the entire text in its original language and 2) actually have a perspective on how these texts actually apply to Jewish life (as many quotes from the Talmud are meant to impart lessons or are part of narratives and are not meant to be practical and are definitely not laws or customs to be followed in practice.)\n\nAs for saying Blacks dominate the NBA, I believe they make up 75%.  Even by the most generous example (ie., not people who identify as Jewish, but anyone who is genetically Jewish), less than 10% of the media is Jewish.  Even if you limit it to the upper levels of the media establishment, the highest number I've seen quoted is 20%.\n\nLast, Kevin MacDonald is not a credible source for anything.  He is blatantly anti-semitic. He is a holocaust denier and, along with Richard Spencer and the like, is part of the White Nationalist Movement.  His work has been thoroughly discredited by academics and historians.\n\nBased on these last sources and some of your comments, it seems that you are either a supporter of the same White Nationalist ideology or you are extremely ignorant of the people and opinions you are promulgating.

From earliest times descriptions Jews and Judaism occur in the works of Greek authors, some of whom belonged to Ihe school of Aristotle, Thus, Theophrastus, one of Aristotlek foremost pupils. in his work On Piety described the Jewish sacrificial rites as utterly different from those of the Greek, consisting entirely of holocausts, offered the middle of the night. The Jews are described by him as philosophers whose custom It is to converse among themselves about theology at the time of the offering of the sacrifices and to gaze at the stars. \n\n&gt;His contemporary, Clearchus. who was also a member of the Peripatetic school, in his dialogue \"On Sleep\" gives the contents of a conversation supposedly held between Aristotle and a Jew in Asia Minor (see below).

His exact contributions are difficult to disentangle from those of his mentor Leucippus, as they are often mentioned together in texts. Their speculation on atoms, taken from Leucippus, bears a passing and partial resemblance to the nineteenth-century understanding of atomic structure that has led some to regard Democritus as more of a scientist than other Greek philosophers; however, their ideas rested on very different bases.[5] Largely ignored in ancient Athens, Democritus was nevertheless well known to his fellow northern-born philosopher Aristotle. Plato is said to have disliked him so much that he wished all his books burned.[6] **Many consider Democritus to be the \"father of modern science\".**\n\n[He's the first accuser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel), isn't that hilarious? That the \"father of modern science\" who literally founded the atomic model of the universe was literally an \"antisemitic conspiracy theorist\"\n\n&gt;**The earliest known example of a blood libel is from Democritus (c. 460\u2013370 BCE), who alleged that \"every seven years the Jews captured a stranger, brought him to the temple in Jerusalem, and sacrificed him, cutting his flesh into bits.\"**\n\nBy extension I suppose \"science\" in general must be \"antisemitic\"\n\nAnother infamous antisemite [conspiracy theorist was Oprah Winfrey](https://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/11263)\n\n&gt;Oprah Once Promoted Blood Libel on TV, Now Welcomed\n25 Years after promoting blood libel on National Television, Oprah is welcomed by Orthodox Community with open arms.\n\nThere's clearly a goyish conspiracy to frame some Jews of a disgusting crime.

Let's really turn this into a teachable moment. We need to talk about race and everything that's connected to it. Including someone who looks like me\u2014her skin tone looks like mine\u2014I didn't know she was african american. I thought she was from Iran. And how she and Barack Obama hung out.

I thought the bitch was white! Fuck!\u201d and \"I'm trying to talk about Iran, I'm trying to talk about Valerie Jarrett wrote the Iran deal! That's what my tweet was about!\u201d\n\nHuh ok good way to clarify. Let's see if she has a history of these things\n\n&gt;In 2013, Barr said former National Security Advisor Susan Rice was a \u201cbig man with swinging ape balls\u201d\n\nInteresting, another black woman \"with ape balls\". The tweet has been deleted ofc. \n\n&gt;Earlier this year, Barr shared a conspiracy theory about Trump that claims he has freed hundreds of children who are the victims of sex trafficking by breaking up their rings.\n\nTotally not extremist views. \n\n&gt;Barr has also made\u00a0Islamophobic comments, including an attack on former Hillary Clinton adviser Huma Abedin, whom she called a \u201cjew hater\u201d and \u201cfilthy nazi whore\u201d in 2016, according to The Daily Beast.\n\nWell, at least it's not racist that time. \n\n&gt;\"Sorry to have tweeted incorrect info about you!\" she wrote.\u00a0\"Please forgive me! By the way, George Soros is a nazi who turned in his fellow Jews 2 be murdered in German concentration camps &amp; stole their wealth-were you aware of that? But, we all make mistakes, right Chelsea?\"\n\n&gt;In 2011, she argued that\u00a0Goldman Sachs should be executed; in 2012, she tweeted about \u201cJewish mind control\u201d;\u00a0and in 2013, she heavily promoted a concert by an artist with a history of Holocaust denial and then angrily defended him (calling her detractors \u201cfucking morons\u201d). And on her personal blog, she\u00a0repeatedly stated\u00a0that Israel was a \u201cNazi state,\u201d adding, \u201cThe Jewish Soul is being tortured in Israel.\u201d But just a few years later, after experiencing an \u201cawakening\u201d of her own Jewish identity, she started tweeting about \u201cIslamic pedo culture\u201d\n\n\nExcept Soros is a jew and blah blah blah other irrelevant info. But she seems so damn reasonable and upstanding! \n\n&gt;1. You are a primate, so I don't understand this statement.\n\nNow , see, I'm from south africa. I'm African. I'm white however, but that's not the point, if people don't understand the correlation between blacks and apes, well, then people don't have an inkling of what racism _is_.  I'll concede there's been plenty of cases where there's been over reaction to things that could be interpreted as racist, despite meaning otherwise from well meaning people, shit happens. I'll concede that blacks/other people of colors racism towards their own kind do get overlooked sometimes, or pointed out for hypocrisy, but that's not a major issue in America, comparatively. Here that boils down to tribalism, something Barr and other, far right wingers are pushing hard for, clearly not seeing the irony. \n\n&gt;or the countless other ironic images of faces of animals that look like celebrities.\n\nWhich again, is all about context. Trump and orangutans are orange. SJP is a horse. Snoop looks like a stoned chihuahua. You don't call black celebrities/politicians pedophile apes who rape children and such. Her intent was clear and these rambling excuses are pathetic. \n\n&gt;There's no need to fire hundreds of people because people overreacted to a tweet from a historically offensive person.\n\nIf your entertainment industry captain decides to scuttle the ship, then everyone on board drowns, not the first time shows were scrapped leaving people ruined. \n\n&gt;Also serious question, how much black do you need in your DNA to be considered black, or is it just that one of your parents considers themselves black? Is Laura Jarrett black too\n\nThat's a damn good question. Personally it's dependant on how you're treated. It's obvious how blacks/other races are treated by some people, and vice versa. The fact that society still treats people like shit for their skin color and not because of who they are accordingly (whether a cunt of a person or the most amazing) is frustrating. If racism wasn't an issue, then people couldn't use racism as a defense for being a shitty person.\n\nIf you're visibly black, then you're black. If you grew up in black culture, but you're not black, then why don't you get treated as a black initially? Same the other way around, a black kid can grow up in a white household in the whitest neighborhood around, but they'll still be *GASP* treated/mistreated as a black. I suppose you're as black as the discrimination against you on a noticeable frequency. What's frustrating is the _focus_on black racism or hate crimes, when there's indian/Asian etc racism too, which rarely  gets coverage. Black culture is more outspoken about these things, It's almost like centuries of slavery, prosecution and abuse really fucks people up. \n\nSeperating culture and race is hard, but not impossible. Pointing out how rap is shit music and promoted a horrible mindset for younger generations(imo) that caused a lot of damage in the ghettos(along with CIA crack) is a good point, compared to \"Ahh fuck these monkeys with guns\" \n", "score": 28, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "nottheonion", "date_year_month": "2018-07", "created_utc_converted": "2018-07-27 08:17:22", "score_overall": 9, "words": "jew globalist conspiracy jew jewish holocaust jewish jewish jew", "shared_words": "jew globalist conspiracy jewish holocaust", "socre_distint": 5}

Just before her 27th birthday the woman she thought she\u2019d marry broke up with her, by calling her and asking if she could arrange not to be home that afternoon so they could move all their stuff out.\n\nOur friend\u2019s coping mechanism was to completely re-build her house (the house that had been *their house*). This ended up changing everything because, over the course of the nine month re-build, she fell in love with her builder, Andy.\n\nAs she said to me on the day this all came out:\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t understand any of it. I\u2019ve never felt like this about any boy. Ever. I mean, boys are just \u2018there\u2019, you know?

Mind you, Andy and her are still together. Married. Kids. Even in business together.\n\nMy friend \u2014 who still \u2018feels like a lesbian in a lot of ways\u2019 \u2014 has stopped trying to understand it. She loves Andy. Andy loves her. She loves her kids and she loves the life she has. She doesn\u2019t have to understand why she was moved by Andy the way she was (and is) to understand that she\u2019s happy.\n\n&gt; So that technically makes me bi\n\nThere\u2019s nothing technical about it. My go to definition of the word is [Robyn Ochs\u2019s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robyn_Ochs):\n\n&gt;&gt; I call myself bisexual because I acknowledge that I have\n&gt;&gt; in myself the potential to be attracted \u2014 romantically\n&gt;&gt; and/or sexually \u2014 to people of more than one sex and/or\n&gt;&gt; gender, not necessarily at the same time, not necessarily\n&gt;&gt; in the same way, and not necessarily to the same degree.    \n\u2014 [A definition of bisexuality](http://robynochs.com/bisexual/)\n\nFWIW, our friend has, over the years, warmed to the bisexual label, largely because she really likes Ochs\u2019s definition.\n\n&gt; Do you think queer is still as offensive as it was in the past? I\n&gt; don\u2019t want to offend the LGBTQ community of the past because they\u2019ve\n&gt; gotten us to where we are today.\n\nReclaiming derogatory terms is, and always will be, a complex and vexed issue.\n\nI\u2019m a Jew and my family-and-friendship circle is mostly Jewish. There are so many anti-Semitic terms for us. But two in particular are relatively well-known: *yid* and *kike*.\n\nIn my circle, and in more than a few mostly-Jewish circles, you will, occasionally, hear one of us use the term *yid* as an affectionate if teasing self-identifier. We only ever use it when there are no goyim around, and we only ever use it when the mood is right and, even then, tone is vital to ensuring everyone understands this is a deliberate act of reclaiming.\n\nThere has been no effort on the part of any Jews I know or am even peripherally aware of, to reclaim the K-word. And I doubt there ever will be.\n\nAnd even our use of \u2018yid\u2019 is careful, circumspect, and heavily reliant on a deep and shared personal history. If we are in kosher company which includes people who are relatively new to us or who are not close friends of us, the term gets put away entirely.\n\nMy family-and-friendship circle is also GSM-heavy, especially relative to our numbers in the wider population. And there is at least one reclaimed GSM-specific slur that has started to show up fairly often in our in-group talk: *queer*. \n\nI still find it difficult to say this word out loud without wincing but have gotten somewhat comfortable using it in the right context in written discourse. Younger folk in my circle have less difficulty with the word. And I suspect, given a decade or more\u2019s solid re-claimed use, there will emerge even younger GSM people who\u2019s primary awareness of the word is as a neutral, even positive, self-identifier.\n\nStaying in sexual identity territory, and by contrast, consider the F-word (faggot). Taking linguistics and anthropology into proper regard, I think the solid argument says its reclaimed status is as complicated and troublesome as it is for the word *yid* in Jewish circles.\n\nThe research I\u2019ve seen on the F-word shows much of its reclaimed use is restricted to Kinsey-6 men talking among themselves. This doesn\u2019t particularly surprise me. My personal experience matches the research. And the term was originally a slur directed at men presumed to engage in physical intimacy with men. (That\u2019s a long-winded way of putting it, but it\u2019s worth remembering the people targeted by the slur weren\u2019t just Kinsey-6 men, even though Kinsey-6 men were the most directly affected by the slur and the malice behind the slur.)\n\nBut the F-word is much less solidly reclaimed than *queer* is. I suspect it sits somewhere near where \u2018yid\u2019 sits in Jewish circles, but with an even more restricted group of users who can use it without being insulting. Because, even in its reclaimed use, there is often a self-hating sub-text of \u2018the sort of Kinsey-6 man that even I, as a Kinsey-6 man, don\u2019t approve of\u2019.\n\n&gt; Some would say my label doesn\u2019t matter because I\u2019m married\n\nAnd they would be wrong.\n\n&gt; but married or not I\u2019m queer/bi and nothing will change that.\n\nAnd this is exactly why they are wrong. Our sexual identity is an aspect of self, not a consequence of circumstance.\n\nTo be absurd about it, if sexual identity were a consequence of circumstance, people with no partnered sexual or romantic history would, by dint of their circumstance, have no sexual identity or would be considered asexual. This is self-evidently not the case. And it\u2019s no less absurd to say equivalent nonsense with regards your sexual identity.\n\n&gt; How do you feel about labels?\n\nCategories are both limiting and useful.\n\nThe universe mostly consists of continua: continuous sequences in which adjacent elements are not perceptibly different from each other, but the extremes are quite distinct.\n\nSo, the entire natural world resists being categorised by its very nature. Which makes all categorisation suspect. Which is an incredibly powerful argument argues against labels of any sort.\n\nPeople, OTOH, love categories. because cognitive shortcuts are our go-to method for dealing with the enormous complexity that continua present. We don\u2019t have the time or the energy to meaingfully deal with the infinite array of continua around us, so we categorise and label. Because we, quite literally, can\u2019t otherwise cope. Which is, at least for practical purposes, an incredibly powerful argument in favour of categories and labels.\n\nWhen I\u2019m trying to understand the universe, I engage with its various continua as best I can. It\u2019s the only sensible way to understand any aspect of existence. When I\u2019m communicating with other people, I use labels and categories as carefully and as circumspectly as I can. It\u2019s the only reasonable way of being somewhat confident our communications will be understood.\n\nAs for the bisexual label in particular, I keep coming back to Robyn Ochs\u2019s definition because it embraces the continua of this particular aspect of existence without rendering the term so broad as to be meaningless.\n\nBeing bisexual isn\u2019t about 50:50 splits or equivalent feelings. It\u2019s that \u2018potential to be attracted\u2019 that makes us *not monosexual*. And, even if it\u2019s only one person, that potential changes so much. And taking on the shared identifying label is helpful because you\u2019ve immediately got a bunch of other people to talk to who instantly understand at least something of your experience.\n\nWhether we\u2019re 50:50 or 90:10 or 10:90, just recognising our capacity to love and lust across the gender spectrum puts us in a different space compared to the monosexual experience.

{"archived": false, "author": "usernumber1337", "body": "&gt; Because of the \"panel-talk\" nature of the show a lot of ideas are just shoved out there and many are not true. An example is when they called Alex Jones a homophobe because he called someone a \"broke-back\" (meaning they're weak, they probably made the connection with broke back mountain) and an anti semite because he claimed that a CNN anchor owned the banks. Alex Jones is insane but he's never been anti-semitic. In fact, he's probably the biggest jew-supporting conspiracy theorist i've ever seen on Youtube. He denies all Jew-bank-theory stuff. He wasn't saying the anchor was bad because he was Jewish. The anchor wasn't even Jewish, he was an Atheist.\n\nI saw that video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVL59_I-z88) and this is what Alex Jones said, in the two segments about Stelter, who is of course a CNN journalist and not a banker:\n\n&gt; He wants to run your life, he wants to control every aspect of your life because he is a cowardly, degenerate sack of anti-human trash. I pledge before my heavenly father that I will resist them every way I can. These people are the literal demon spawn of the pit of hell. Look at him. And you know what? He is better than you if you let him run your life. He runs your kids, he runs the schools, he runs the banks. This guy, this spirit, this smiling, leering devil that thinks you can't see what he is. He is your enemy. Period. All the narcissistic, devil worshipping filth. I see you, enemy! I see you enemy! Enemy! You are my enemy. And I swear total resistance to you with everything I've got\n\n&gt; Disingenuous, fake, false, brokeback. Twisted, a defiler, a betrayer, a backstabber, a devil! You will pay! Yeah you think I don't see your face, scum? You think I don't see you Stelter? I see you, you understand me? I know what you think of me and my family. I see you right back, you understand that? You will fall. You will not bring humantiy down. God is going to destroy you. Get him off the screen. God they're so evil, just please god free us form them. They're drunk on our children's blood for god's sake.\n\nAll this, again, about a CNN journalist who apparently runs the banks and engages in blood libel (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel), an accusation that is generally thrown at Jews by anti-semites. \n\n\nAbout the use of 'brokeback', according to urban dictionary, the term brokback is used 'to describe anything of questionable masculinity' or to 'a male engaging in anal intercourse with another male' (https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Brokeback), not to call someone weak. And I don't think that calling him weak in the context of the rest of that diatribe even makes much sense. He runs your kids, the schools and the banks, he is the devil, we have to appeal to god to free us from 'them'.....but he's weak..?\n\nSounds pretty homophobic and anti-semitic to me tbh\n\n\nEdit: I will grant you that Cenk did not cover himself in glory in the Sam Harris debate and they do talk more badly of Trump supporters than we're used to in the media. But then I've never really bought the argument that we need to reach out and show respect and love to the people who spent 8 years calling Obama a Kenyan Muslim terrorist and wearing 'fuck your feelings' t-shirts. Respect is supposed to work both ways but it seems only one side is expected to show it.

{"archived": false, "author": "charmed_im-sure", "body": "Dr. Stanton is an incredible man. Let me help. \n\nThe Ten Stages of Genocide\n\nGenocide is a process that develops in ten stages that are predictable but not inexorable. At each stage, preventive measures can stop it. The process is not linear. Stages may occur simultaneously. Logically, later stages must be preceded by earlier stages. But all stages continue to operate throughout the process.\n\n1 - Classification: All cultures have categories to distinguish people into \u201cus and them\u201d by ethnicity, race, religion, or nationality: German and Jew, Hutu and Tutsi. Bipolar societies that lack mixed categories are the most likely to have genocide. The main preventive measure at this early stage is to develop universalistic institutions that transcend ethnic or racial divisions, that actively promote tolerance and understanding, and that promote classifications that transcend the divisions. \n\n 2 - Symbolization: We give names or other symbols to the classifications. We name people \u201cJews\u201d or \u201cGypsies,\u201d or distinguish them by colors or dress; and apply the symbols to members of groups. Classification and symbolization are universally human and do not necessarily result in genocide unless they lead to dehumanization. When combined with hatred, symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of pariah groups. \n\n3 - Discrmination: A dominant group uses law, custom, and political power to deny the rights of other groups. The powerless group may not be accorded full civil rights, voting rights, or even citizenship. The dominant group is driven by an exclusionary ideology that would deprive less powerful groups of their rights. The ideology advocates monopolization or expansion of power by the dominant group. It legitimizes the victimization of weaker groups. Advocates of exclusionary ideologies are often charismatic, expressing resentments of their followers, attracting support from the masses. \n\n4 - Dehumanization: One group denies the humanity of the other group. Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects or diseases. Dehumanization overcomes the normal human revulsion against murder. At this stage, hate propaganda in print and on hate radios is used to vilify the victim group. The majority group is taught to regard the other group as less than human, and even alien to their society. They are indoctrinated to believe that \u201cWe are better off without them.\u201d The powerless group can become so depersonalized that they are actually given numbers rather than names, as Jews were in the death camps. They are equated with filth, impurity, and immorality. Hate speech fills the propaganda of official radio, newspapers, and speeches.\n\n5 - Organization: Genocide is always organized, usually by the state, often using militias to provide deniability of state responsibility. (An example is the Sudanese government\u2019s support and arming of the Janjaweed in Darfur.) Sometimes organization is informal (Hindu mobs led by local RSS militants during Indian partition) or decentralized (jihadist terrorist groups.) Special army units or militias are often trained and armed. Arms are purchased by states and militias, often in violation of UN Arms Embargos, to facilitate acts of genocide. States organize secret police to spy on, arrest, torture, and murder people suspected of opposition to political leaders. Special training is given to murderous militias and special army killing units.\n\n6 - Polarization: Extremists drive the groups apart. Hate groups broadcast polarizing propaganda. Motivations for targeting a group are indoctrinated through mass media. Laws may forbid intermarriage or social interaction. Extremist terrorism targets moderates, intimidating and silencing the center. Moderates from the perpetrators\u2019 own group are most able to stop genocide, so are the first to be arrested and killed. Leaders in targeted groups are the next to be arrested and murdered. The dominant group passes emergency laws or decrees that grants them total power over the targeted group. The laws erode fundamental civil rights and liberties. Targeted groups are disarmed to make them incapable of self-defense, and to ensure that the dominant group has total control.\n\n7 - Preparation: Plans are made for genocidal killings. National or perpetrator group leaders plan the \u201cFinal Solution\u201d to the Jewish, Armenian, Tutsi or other targeted group \u201cquestion.\u201d They often use euphemisms to cloak their intentions, such as referring to their goals as \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d \u201cpurification,\u201d or \u201ccounter-terrorism.\u201d They build armies, buy weapons and train their troops and militias. They indoctrinate the populace with fear of the victim group. Leaders often claim that \u201cif we don\u2019t kill them, they will kill us,\u201d disguising genocide as self-defense. Acts of genocide are disguised as counter-insurgency if there is an ongoing armed conflict or civil war. There is a sudden increase in inflammatory rhetoric and hate propaganda with the objective of creating fear of the other group. Political processes such as peace accords that threaten the total dominance of the genocidal group or upcoming elections that may cost them their grip on total power may actually trigger genocide.\n\n Prevention of preparation may include arms embargoes and commissions to enforce them. It should include prosecution of **incitement and conspiracy to commit genocide, both crimes under Article 3 of the Genocide Convention**.\n\n 8 - Persecution: Victims are identified and separated out because of their ethnic or religious identity. Death lists are drawn up. In state sponsored genocide, members of victim groups may be forced to wear identifying symbols. Their property is often expropriated. Sometimes they are even segregated into ghettoes, deported into concentration camps, or confined to a famine-struck region and starved. They are deliberately deprived of resources such as water or food in order to slowly destroy them. Programs are implemented to prevent procreation through forced sterilization or abortions. **Children are forcibly taken from their parents.**  The victim group\u2019s basic human rights become systematically abused through extrajudicial killings, torture and forced displacement.  Genocidal massacres begin. They are acts of genocide because they intentionally destroy part of a group. The perpetrators watch for whether such massacres meet any international reaction. If not, they realize that that the international community will again be bystanders and permit another genocide. \n     \nAt this stage, a Genocide Emergency must be declared. If the political will of the great powers, regional alliances, or U.N. Security Council or the U.N. General Assembly can be mobilized, armed international intervention should be prepared, or heavy assistance provided to the victim group to prepare for its self-defense. \n\n9 - Extermination: begins, and quickly becomes the mass killing legally called \u201cgenocide.\u201d It is \u201cextermination\u201d to the killers because they do not believe their victims to be fully human. When it is sponsored by the state, the armed forces often work with militias to do the killing. Sometimes the genocide results in revenge killings by groups against each other, creating the downward whirlpool-like cycle of bilateral genocide. \n \n10 - Denial: is the final stage that lasts throughout and always follows genocide. It is among the surest indicators of further genocidal massacres. The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves, burn the bodies, try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses. They deny that they committed any crimes, and often blame what happened on the victims. They block investigations of the crimes, and continue to govern until driven from power by force, when they flee into exile. There they remain with impunity, like Pol Pot or Idi Amin, unless they are captured and a tribunal is established to try them.\n\nref: http://genocidewatch.net/genocide-2/8-stages-of-genocide/", "score": 6, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "politics", "date_year_month": "2018-08", "created_utc_converted": "2018-08-01 12:47:54", "score_overall": 4, "words": "jew silencing jewish conspiracy", "shared_words": "jew silencing jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

{"archived": false, "author": "lancswolf", "body": "&gt; Being a Jew on the Corbyn left is soul- crushing. In the name of the cause, you must excuse racism in all but its extreme forms. The presence of a real Jew in its midst provides the left with cover. But stray from the party line, and you are not a comrade having a legitimate disagreement. You are a Jew and only a Jew, a corrupted and illegitimate voice that has no place in left-wing discussions.\n&gt; \n&gt; The compromises Jewish leftists must swallow can be seen in the faintly pathetic career of Jon Lansman. In theory, there is nothing pathetic about him. The founder of Momentum is the third most powerful man in the Labour movement, behind only John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn. In the current issue of the Jewish Quarterly, Lansman insists he is not living a kind of lie but combining left-wing politics with a principled stand against anti-Semitism. \u2018Having grown up as a north London Jew, the fight against anti-Semitism is core to my political roots. Anti-Semitism and the Holocaust were what brought me to where I am politically.\u2019\n&gt; \n&gt; Lansman went on to tell Guardian readers that, far from producing a charter for racists, Labour\u2019s rewriting of the internationally agreed definition of anti-Semitism set a new \u2018gold standard\u2019. There was not one person on Labour\u2019s National Executive Committee who did not \u2018want to deal with anti-Semitism\u2019.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here are the gold standards Lansman must live by. This week, Peter Willsman, a Momentum member of the very National Executive Committee which Lansman said was united in its opposition to anti-Semitism in Labour, denied its existence: \u2018I\u2019ve certainly never seen it.\u2019 In a voice filled with venom, he boomed that concerns about racism weren\u2019t genuine but the malicious inventions of Jewish \u2018Trump fanatics\u2019. Labour MPs condemned him for propagating straight lies, but Lansman stayed silent, as did his patron, Jeremy Corbyn. At the time of going to press, Momentum was recommending that its supporters did not vote for Willsman in a forthcoming NEC election. Lansman was maintaining his silence, however, and keeping Willsman as a Momentum member.\n&gt; \n&gt; In March, Christine Shawcroft resigned as head of Labour\u2019s internal disputes panel after the Times revealed she had sent an email to Lansman outlining her opposition to the suspension of a Labour council candidate who posted a Facebook article which called the Holocaust a \u2018hoax\u2019. If you believed Lansman\u2019s claim that rage at the genocide of European Jewry drove him into politics, you would expect him to have exploded with anger.\n&gt; \n&gt; Momentum\u2019s records in Companies House \u2014 for, rather marvellously, Lansman\u2019s grassroots movement is a private company \u2014 show Shawcroft remains one of its directors. The accounts were updated on 24 June, three months after her resignation, so no outrage from Lansman on show there either.\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2017, Labour suspended one Mike Sivier, a Welsh member who appeared on the Richie Allen podcast, a conspiracist show endorsed by David Icke. Elsewhere, Sivier said it \u2018may be entirely justified\u2019 to maintain Tony Blair had been \u2018unduly influenced by a cabal of Jewish advisers\u2019. When Sivier came before the Labour Disputes Committee, the Labour insider site Red Roar reported that Lansman defended rather than condemned him. Sivier then refused to attend the racism awareness course Labour offered as a slap on the wrist.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lansman can show anger \u2014 against those who complain about left-wing racism. In a recording obtained by the Evening Standard in April, Lansman accepted that there were valid charges of racism, but most were \u2018opportunistic\u2019 because they had been made by the Campaign against Anti-Semitism. Lansman dismissed the campaign as \u2018so right-wing\u2019. In fact it has no political affiliation and is a registered charity.\n&gt; \n&gt; In that same month, the Guardian said multiple sources had told the paper that Lansman and his comrades defended members accused of racism because \u2018they were perceived to be sympathetic to Corbyn\u2019. The evidence against them could be \u2018overwhelming\u2019. But the evidence didn\u2019t matter. Sectarian manoeuvres trumped anti-racist principle. \u2018It\u2019s all about control: control of the party and control of the processes.\u2019\n&gt; \n&gt; Even when activists are expelled from Labour for their foul conduct, they are not expelled from Momentum. Labour kicked out Tony Greenstein after he called Labour members \u2018Zios\u2019, \u2018Janus-faced whores\u2019 and supporters of \u2018Israeli child abuse\u2019. Lansman wanted to expel Greenstein from Momentum but lacked the political courage to do so. He backed off because Greenstein \u2018will make a big deal of\u2019 the process, \u2018possibly including lawyers\u2019.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you begin to see a pattern emerging? When he talks to the outside world, Lansman is brave and firm. When he is in the fetid meeting rooms of the far left his valour disappears. \u2018I have been vocal in calling out the blindness to anti-Semitism,\u2019 Lansman boasted to Guardian readers. Yet when calling out may upset his comrades, Lansman falls silent. It may be that after a lifetime on the political margins, he thinks that ignoring the conspiracy theory of fascism is a price worth paying for a Corbyn victory. In his Jewish Quarterly interview, he talks of his anger at how Thatcher and Blair destroyed the old Labour movement and his delight that \u2018enormous numbers of young people\u2019 were now turning to old socialists. Why cause trouble when the world is moving his way?\n&gt; \n&gt; But as someone who has been excommunicated from the left, I suspect a more craven motive. When Corbyn supporters cite the support of Lansman or groups such as the tiny Jewish Voices for Labour as evidence that accusations of left anti-Semitism are groundless, they argue in bad faith. If Lansman or any other Jew were to say they had gone too far and must change their behaviour, the left would denounce them.\n&gt; \n&gt; When he challenged Corbyn\u2019s appointee for the post of Labour general secretary, Corbyn supporters immediately told Lansman his views were worthless because he was \u2018a Zionist infiltrator\u2019, who puts \u2018Israel above the left or even Britain\u2019. In Leninist terms, the function of Jews on the modern left is to be useful idiots who can be dispensed with as soon as their usefulness ends.

{"archived": false, "author": "black_square", "body": "This is a longish, not entirely coherent run over some of the events surrounding Corbyn, Labour, the British Left and antisemitism. I typed it out thinking through things for myself, but the DT is usually dead on the weekend anyway and it was still sitting here so I figured I'd post.\n\n_____\n\nThere's been a lot going around about Corbyn/Labour and their mishandling of trying to get it out of the Labour party. A lot of it is fair and their mishandling of behaviour is depressing. This goes back to Livingstone talking about Hitler being a zionist (big lol at Netanyahu's recent similar comments), then some irrelevant councillors and some members here and there. Enough scrutiny eventually gets them to produce the Chakrabarti report (bit of a fudge, but not terrible) and now more recently the new rules/definitions while not taking on the full IHRA examples (note: took on everything else just not about 4 specific examples). Aside from it being dumb to not just take those examples on boad the biggest issue is how they seem to have not consulted with Jewish people about it all and how in general there seems to be very little concern with how they feel about it. The opinions of various groups, Rabbis and so on have been dismissed in a way that I can't imagine other minority voices would be.\n\nBut then some of it is just smearing nonsense. Such as pointing to David Duke saying Corbyn is alright but of course not mentioning this: https://twitter.com/DrDavidDuke/status/872709811149975552?s=19 . Then writing about Corbyn sharing a platform with someone who compares Israeli treatment of Palestinians, while omitting that the person who said it is an Auschwitz survivor (not to say that he's right, but the omission is telling). In general some of the media coverage probably does have to be viewed in light of the Tory party being very weak at the moment and the press always having had their knives out for Corbyn.\n\nCorbyn does of course have plenty to answer for. His repeated appearances alongside people with deeply antisemitic views is unforgiveable imo, even calling people in Hamas 'brothers'. He would never appear alongside people with other racist opinions. However, I do not think this makes him antisemitic. What it does do is call to question his style of politics, the way he sees the world and how that opens up spaces for antisemitic views. It is basically oppressor vs. oppressed. In this scenario the Palestinians are the oppressed and thus anything said against their oppressor (Israel/Jewish people) gets a pass. Add to that a deep anti-American 'imperialism' and that is basically the foundation of his foreign policy. You can also see this style in how he handled the IRA, inviting them to parliament a week after they'd bombed and killed people. Doing this did not make him anti-English, just deeply stupid. Jewish people seem to provide a problem for many people on the left, since they are a minority that face plenty of discrimination, but also in much of modern society are a very successful group. Israel being a successful nation compared to many that surround it (and one that does commit many inexcusable offences) also feeds into this.\n\nI will also bring this to one of the most hotly contested issues with the recent argument of IHRA examples (3 of the 4 examples are arguably 'covered' with slightly different language used, this one isn't at all). This centres around the foundation of Israel.\n\n&gt;Contemporary examples of antisemitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere could, taking into account the overall context, include, but are not limited to:\n\n&gt;Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.\n\nI don't think Corbyn would contest the first sentence here (denying the jewish....) but the second part comes up, once again, against his oppressed vs. oppressor view. In his eyes the foundation of Israel displaced one 'race' (palestinians) to allow another one to set up a state. Is that a racist endeavour? I'm not knowledgeable about the foundation of Israel to really say, afaik the British government control of Palestine limited Jewish migration to Palestine a lot pre-WWII and zionist immigration had been going on since the late 19th century, this does not necessarily mean displacement in the formation of Israel's beginnings. Corbyn's views probably contest borders of Israel and Palestine after WWII.\n\nOne could say that the idea of a foundation of Israel is not racist, but acts committed to set up the current formation of the State of Israel could be viewed as such. And even with these qualms (justified or not) I think the IHRA saying that these examples 'could, taking into account the overall context' gives plenty of room to have reasoned debates and express these views without being labelled an antisemite.\n\nYou can see Corbyn himself expressing how he has certain issues with the formation of Israel: https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6928706/jeremy-corbyn-labour-israel-foundation/\n\nTo my eyes and ears it doesn't come across as actually antisemitic. This is also now made more difficult by recent actions by the Israeli state about it being for Jewish people.\n\nNow, I could be wrong. It's only relatively recently (few years) that I haven't viewed Israel/Palestine in a way that isn't simply oppressor vs. oppressed. But even with that view anti-semitism has always been an anathema, and it's obvious why Jewish people rightly feel/felt the need to have a state where Jewish people can feel safe and at home. While anti-semitism exists in British society I have only come across it a couple of times (one by far-right idiots and another by some muslims which again stems from Israel/Palestine). Sadly instances are on the rise and the Labour party aren't doing anything to help stop it.\n\nI think this: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/12/opinion/anti-semitism-and-the-british-left.html is a good article. Paritcularly these two paragraphs sum it up for me:\n\n&gt;Mr. Corbyn himself appears bemused. The mantra he repeats \u2014 that he is opposed to racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia (he rarely speaks solely of anti-Semitism) \u2014 suggests that he is wedded to the idea that anti-Semitism is chiefly a right-wing phenomenon. It is true that Mr. Corbyn\u2019s predecessor as Labour leader, Ed Miliband, was the target of some thinly veiled anti-Semitic slurs from Britain\u2019s tabloid newspapers. But the notion that well-meaning people on the left might also harbor bias against Jews seems to pass him by.\n\n&gt;The insensitivity extends to Mr. Corbyn\u2019s inner circle. One senior party spokesman, Paul Flynn, said in 2011 that Britain should not appoint a Jew as ambassador to Israel, because the post should be filled by \u201csomeone with roots\u201d in Britain who couldn\u2019t \u201cbe accused of having Jewish loyalty\u201d \u2014 unwittingly invoking the anti-Semitic trope of Jewish disloyalty. This year, one of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s closest aides, Seumas Milne, wanted to remove the greeting \u201cChag Kasher VeSameach,\u201d which translates as \u201cA Happy and Kosher Holiday,\u2019 from the leader\u2019s Passover message to the community because he felt the use of Hebrew implied support for Zionism. (After some debate, Mr. Milne was overruled.)\n\nCorbyn is blind to it and his particular brand of politics make it difficult for him to see. But at his core I don't think he is actually an antisemite. I think other members of the small British Hard Left do have antisemitic views (such as Paul Flynn).\n\nNow. There is one incident that does make me genuinely wonder whether Corbyn is antisemitic. It concerns a conspiratorial mural (basically Jew bankers run the world stuff), which Corbyn 'supported', comparing it to murals by Diego Rivera being taken down. Vox of course has an 'explainer' which is worth a read about it and British left antisemitism in general: https://www.vox.com/world/2018/3/29/17168320/labour-corbyn-anti-semitism-mural\n\nAnother good post that vox highlight is by Richard Seymour. Seymour is a fairly prominent voice of the British far-left: https://www.patreon.com/posts/three-points-and-17775436\n\nThis bit being key:\n\n&gt;Beyond these types of overt antisemitism, there is a kind of tone deafness that is probably particular to the Left, and comes with a sense of brittle self-righteousness. Think of a long-standing anti-Zionist activist choosing a Jewish Voice for Labour meeting to defend the right to 'free speech' about the Holocaust. Think of a Jewish socialist ranting about \"Zios\". Think of an experienced socialist, rebutting claims of antisemitism by saying \"I've never seen any\". Think of a former mayor of London firing off about the Havaara agreement in the worst possible way, and pointedly not taking any criticism. Think of people gatecrashing a Jewish Labour Movement meeting to make a futile intervention against the 'Zionist lobby'. \n\nIt is this sort of deafness that can be seen in many left wing circles in various forms. Whether it's leftists saying communism will simply solve gender and racial imbalances or antisemitism. The left are the good guys and surely none of them could possibly harbour nasty underlying views. Once we get socialism everything will be fine, don't worry about all the prejudice you face that aren't anything to do with economics, let's work to create the revolution because it'll be alright after it.\n\nPeople who say that are probably not racist, sexist or anything else.

Again, these same people who push the idea that it's a Jewish conspiracy also neglect to mention how many Jews are **pushing against that globalist bullshit**, how many are on the front lines fighting for American ideals, how many are die hard Republicans that see the beauty in *actual* liberalism (not this modern day progressiveness). \n\nThen there's the oddball matter of how religious a Jew is and how they vote. I think it was a Pew study (forgot exactly where) but I read that Jews and people in general who are less religious tend to lean left where the more traditional/religious types tend to vote right. It's not a hard or fast rule but it does seem to hold up more often than not.\n\nSo all in all, I can see where the idea comes from and there is some objective truth in the matter - but I feel it's overshadowed by subjective bullshit which only furthers the muddy waters. In TD though, those subjects get squashed pretty quick and I'm glad because it's too easy to paint a bad picture not too dissimilar to the whole 'Christians hate gays/blacks' bullshit. In a way, it's kind of like the use of FBI statistics where you can push the idea that blacks are inherently evil instead of identifying some actual causes of the increased violence (lack of father figures, high divorce rates, drugs/gangs).\n\n", "score": 8, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "ShitPoliticsSays", "date_year_month": "2018-08", "created_utc_converted": "2018-08-05 02:05:55", "score_overall": 8, "words": "jewish jewish conspiracy jewish jewish conspiracy globalist jew", "shared_words": "jewish conspiracy globalist jew", "socre_distint": 4}

{"archived": false, "author": "falconinthedive", "body": "It depends really on both the origin and the scope of hate. But I'm not convinced it really makes much of a difference beyond racists trying to justify they're not as bad as those other guys.\n\n In America, we do have a strong and persistent legacy of white supremacy which predominantly focuses on African Americans (though on occasion goes nativist a la the Know Nothing Party which hated Catholics or imperialist as with anti-Native American sentiments and actions). It's been behind justifying and enforcing a lot of policies from slavery to lynch mobs, segregation to the Klan. It sometimes hides itself in evangelical Christianity. I would definitely put something like birthers in the Tea Party, the Klan, neo-confederates, and people like Jeff Sessions in this category. It's probably more common among your older racist set. Ones who grew up with segregation, 1960s (and later) race riots.\n\nNazis on the other hand have a wider variety of targets : historically in WWII, Jewish people,  Roma, homosexuals. Their ideology wasn't particularly rooted in any religion (save for Hitler's weird mysticism thing) and was used to justify. The targets of modern nazis may be different, particularly given locales: north America and Britain do not have the Roma to the same extent as Europe in the 30s (or even now) and POCs are more pervasive and obvious than Jewish people generally. Neo-nazi gangs in the 80s targetted people of color and gay people as readily as anyone else and erocan fascists contemporary to WWII were also strongly anti-black.\n\nAnd let's not pretend modern nazis are supportive of Jewish people. The ever present (and spiking in 2017) trend of vandalism by swastika shows that sort of shit's alive and well, but the most successful neo-nazis, say Marine LePin in France, have learned to be anti-Semitic without using epithets. It's (((globalists))) instead of more inflammatory terms and what really are claims of a \"Deep State\" but a rebranded international Jewish conspiracy or anti-Catholic free mason/Illuminati conspiracy theory?\n\nI'd argue dyed in the wool nazi-ism is the more prevalent form of racism online, and in a site like reddit particularly. Sites like Stormfront / the Daily Stormer, while welcoming to neo-confederates, are rooted in more Aryan based ideology, symbolism, and language. Sites like 4chan (and other chans) don't use confederate flags to be edgy and radicalize, they use swastikas. OP's use of misogynist terms for women suggest an affiliation to Gamergate or its spiritual successors which while not a nazi or racist thing in and of itself drew a lot of people to Breitbart which was run by a literal nazi in Bannon (and even if you want to argue he's not, he's certainly bedfellows with enough in Gorka, Miller, etc).\n\nAlso, isn't one of the points literally calling for the extermination of the disabled. Sure, a lot of reddit singular or mass death fantasy threats take the form of hanging--more evocative of lynching and therefore neoconfederate hatred, there are as many gas chamber comments, \n\nEven if the exact details of American nazi-ism aren't identical and the actions aren't to the same scale of the Holocaust (though perhaps similar in scale to nazis in 1934 German), it's clear this hip, young brand of nazis are  modelling themselves after the SS and not the KKK. They're a party in power, which politically makes them more akin to the nazis than some neoconfederate cause).  Charlottesville, organized in these same alt-right enclaves, had a literal torchlit rally where they chanted actual nazi chants. If it sounds like a nazi, acts like a nazi, and pals around on nazi sites, it's not too surprising if it's a nazi.\n\nBut let's not pretend hate groups operate in isolation. I was in a town last year that had a post-Charlottesville rally at a confederate statue that was organized locally by some of our local Stormfront rabble (one of whom has an SS logo neck tattoo) in collaboration with a local group \"Confederate 48\" sounds like american white supremacy, right? Except for it was a branch of a British neo-nazi group. Being one type of racist doesn't preclude other group membership if the opportunity presents itself.", "score": 40, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "MurderedByWords", "date_year_month": "2018-08", "created_utc_converted": "2018-08-06 22:22:02", "score_overall": 8, "words": "jewish jewish jewish jewish conspiracy illuminati conspiracy holocaust", "shared_words": "jewish conspiracy illuminati holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}
{"archived": false, "author": "borahorzagobuchol", "body": "&gt;  Since you seem to be confused. Here's an education. Fascism was a Socialist ideology.\n\n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af I suppose that is why every fascist state strongly opposed the fundamentally egalitarian aims of socialism and stoked fear of communism in its population. If you squint and squeeze your eyes and equivocate hard enough, always willing to ignore the evidence that contradicts your thesis, you can convince yourself of anything. Especially if you have the political will to do so. \n\n&gt;Even your little 3rd grade Info-Graphic says they're against FREE SPEECH.\n\nYes, they are explicitly against \"free speech\" of Nazi's advocating for genocide and they directly admit that in the graphic. Those horrible people.\n\n&gt;They've Protested against a Jew. Ben Shaipro has been threatened with death, Antifa Protests against him, and tries to slience the Jewish voice.\n\nYou are highly invested in a monolithic view of the world. Apparently every member of Antifa, an inherently decentralized group based entirely and solely around opposing fascism, agrees with every other member on everything. So when some of them vocally criticize a prominent American conservative, you ignore that he is a conservative in favor of being a Jew, decide that he is \"the Jewish voice\" that apparently speaks for all Jews, and decide that any tactic chosen to criticize him by individual members of Antifa is a criticism and tactic they all share. Again, just keep on squinting and equivocating and all of this makes a kind of sense!\n\n&gt;The son of a Professor cracked someone's Skull with a bicycle lock.\n\nYep. You [see these guys](https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_15/1966851/ss-170416-tax-day-protest-6-423p-rs_2035538aacd696abafe52451c67f6f11.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.jpg), who showed up at a protest ready to throw down? Fucking Antifa. Wait... no, those are all [far right nationalists](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/how-berkeley-became-new-battleground-free-speech-n749536). And that guy standing with them, with the dumb expression on his face... he look [familiar to you](https://img.youtube.com/vi/9qKCl9NL1Cg/0.jpg)?\n\nSo, lets get our narrative straight. A far right nationalist shows up at a rally looking to fight, literally standing behind the people directly instigating violence. A random person identifying with Antifa attacks him, then suddenly the he becomes a martyr. His picture and story posted and reposted every... single... time... the dozens and dozens of Antifa rallies are mentioned in order to discredit each and every one of them. One guy gets hit with a bike lock by a member of Antifa and it becomes a rally call that lasts for years, while we have actual studies demonstrating that [right wing nationalists murder twice as many Americans as radical Islamists](https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/terrorism-in-america/) (not Antifa mind you, who you'll be hard pressed finding to have murdered anyone, but radical Islamists, though I'm guessing you can't tell the difference), and your silence is deafening.\n\nPlease, mention the guy that got hit with the bike lock some more, that is clearly [the kind of terrorism we should be worried about](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic1.businessinsider.com%2Fimage%2F55316342ecad046c1a8b4567-1200-1091%2Fap511720987539.jpg&amp;f=1).\n\n&gt;They want to attack non-violent Jewish conservatives. \n\nKeep on keeping on with that conflation. One guy who showed up ready to fight at a protest is the same as a political commentator, and that political commentator has been \"attacked\" with the same kind of violence. He is literally, figuratively, bleeding from the head from those verbal attacks. \n\nAnd black is white and one equals zero, for certain values of white and zero. Of course, the same kinds of attacks come at Ben [from his past associates on the right](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/05/ben-shapiros-messy-breakup-with-breitbart.html), but I suppose that actual anti-semitic slander doesn't qualify as \"violent\" verbal attacks and the people involved are isolated individuals rather than a monolithic whole representing an entire ideology.\n\n&gt;Seriously, If you're PRO-Equality. Great. Almost everyone else is too.\n\nSure, I mean your example guy, Ben Shapiro, doesn't think [everyone should have an equal right to marriage](https://www.creators.com/read/ben-shapiro/07/15/the-real-goal-of-the-same-sex-marriage-movement). So not pro-equality in that regard. He doesn't believe that [income inequality](https://www.truthrevolt.org/news/shapiro-why-socialism-rise) matters at all either, despite its real world affects on equality of opportunity, education, health care, safety, etc. But there is a *kind *of equality he believes in, so long as it ridicules the very concept of economic privilege, institutional racial bias, or other hallmarks of actually existing real-world inequalities.\n\n&gt; You think he's a Nazi?\n\nWait, now **I'm** a part of your \"conflate everything that I disagree with\" mentality? Did I throw a bike lock at Ben Shapiro's head as well?\n\n&gt;That's the point of free speech. You don't get to pick and choose. You give everyone free speech.\n\nI suppose that yelling \"FIRE\" in a crowded theater ought to be allowed, since we can't pick and choose. And threatening to murder someone, that should be okay as well, since we can't have any kind of nuance and discernment when espousing vague ideals. And remember, when the audience advocates that a publisher and distributor stop creating a platform for a speaker, but that speaker is still entirely capable of distributing their content themselves or through other third parties, that is \"silencing free speech\". On the other hand, when that same distributor practices everyday editorial control from the top down, that is just good business. So long as it is people in power deciding who gets their voice broadcast, everything is fine, but if someone tries a grass-roots attempt to change what we hear everyday... I mean those people are fascists by definition. (well, not by definition, and not really fascists, but if we squint hard enough we can pretend)\n\n&gt;That was the name of the Nazi Party before it became Nazi BTW.\n\nI'm aware. I'm also aware that the Chinese government currently refers to itself as a \"democratic republic\" despite being neither a democracy nor a republic, and that the USSR referred to itself as a \"Soviet Republic\" even while it crushed elected soviet councils, and that when the Nazis invaded Poland they claimed it was to [prevent the mistreatment of German minorities](http://fcit.usf.edu/HOLOCAUST/resource/document/HITLER1.htm).

{"archived": false, "author": "_narrows", "body": "&gt;If you're going to use that right to speak to ruin people's lives, fuck you, you shouldn't have that \"right.\"\n\nWe\u2019re not just talking about the Sandy Hook issue and Alex Jones. In that instance, I agree, he should be sued (as he IS being sued) for libel. The other shit he says, he has a perfect right to say. Gay frogs and whatnot aren\u2019t ruining anyone\u2019s lives. \n\nI\u2019m not even disagreeing with his \u201cde-platforming\u201d. These companies have the right to associate as they please. \n\nI am suggesting that the blowback Twitter (particularly @jack, as he justified the decision to NOT ban Jones) has received is odd, since, according to Twitter, Jones didn\u2019t violate the RULES of that platform. They\u2019re trying to observe the very rules they created in a fair and equitable manner. Isn\u2019t that the correct thing to do?\n\nI\u2019m also suggesting that the prior poster is wrong in not only reveling in Jones\u2019 dismissal, but readily suggests OTHER people who\u2019ve done NOTHING CLOSE to what Jones has done, either with regard to conspiratorial horseshit regarding Sandy Hook, or really ANYTHING else approaching him should be silenced. They just don\u2019t like people like Dinesh D\u2019Souza. \n\nThat\u2019s fucked up.\n\n&gt;Neither the state nor corporate fucks have never needed a precedent to silence dissent. \n\nNor have so-called \u201crevolutionaries\u201d. \n\n&gt;McCarthyism wasn't a response to anti-Nazi speech laws; quite the opposite, reactionaries and racists had plenty of free speech when McCarthy began his reign. \n\nAnd what ultimately destroyed McCarthy? We didn\u2019t shove him into a closet. We PUSHED HIS VIEWS INTO THE SUN, where all could see how fucked up they were. \n\n&gt;More recently, at Standing Rock, police rounded up, caged, tortured innocent people for the audacity to pray on their own land. \n\nIt\u2019s funny, because so many of those people who clearly love the land LEFT BEHIND A FUCKING ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS: https://www.yahoo.com/news/cleanup-begins-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-encampment-180743034.html\n\n&gt;Ferguson was peaceful when the state brought in tanks. None of this happened because we started down a slippery slope.\n\nFerguson was peaceful? Are you kidding me right now? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest\n\n&gt;In the case of people who are afraid to be themselves in the presence of open bigots - for example, trans people - free speech certainly isn't increased. \n\nI have the right to tell you, very plainly, that THERE ARE TWO GENDERS. Some edge cases of intersex birth do happen from time to time, but even in those edge cases, those people largely choose to live as one gender; certainly not \u201cxhe\u201d. \n\nYou can live as yourself; just don\u2019t expect or pretend you can compel me to engage in your delusion. \n\n&gt;Extending \"free speech\" to Alex Jones limits the rights you claim to hold so dear for the people who are most likely to have them curtailed.\n\nNobody is having their rights curtailed. You show me a single instance of a law specifically tailored to stymy the rights of trans people (since this is the specific example you provided), to limit their right to work or to housing, and I\u2019m right there with you to change that law. What I WON\u2019T DO is compel others to ignore simple biology, and I also will not agree to this notion that there are LIMITLESS GENDERS, and that a person can just, at a fucking whim, decide they\u2019re a six year old girl (http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/transgender-woman-leaves-wife-7-kids-live-girl-article-1.2463795) and pretend that\u2019s REALITY. wrong.\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, many societies that don't tolerate Nazi, racist, or otherwise horrific speech have much more tolerance for open dissent and speech by the marginalized. And it's not hard to see why: When you let racists spread their ideas, those ideas influence people, and in turn, influence policy. Tolerance of the intolerant leads to less free speech, not more.\n\nAs I said to the other person: if your faith is so easily shaken by someone else\u2019s crisis of faith, how meaningful is it?\n\nGermany doesn\u2019t tolerate Nazi ideology and holocaust denial because it nearly (rightly) wiped them from the fucking map. \n\nIdeas cannot be contained. They can be argued and ridiculed; they often SHOULD BE ridiculed. outlawing them only gives them a kind of sick legitimacy in the \u201ctrue believers\u201d. Better to KNOW who the crazy people are, and how many there are, than to just ignore them and let them fester.\n\n&gt;No, I don't like the idea of corporate overlords making these decisions, but I realize that corporate overlords will censor valid speech regardless, so I'm not going to cry when some of their bullshit hits reactionaries as well.\n\nOh Jesus, \u201creactionaries\u201d. You\u2019re one of *those* people, aren\u2019t you? Are you a socialist? or maybe a full on communist? Just let me know what\u2019s what, so I know the stripe of crazy I\u2019m dealing with. \n\n&gt;Most of the noble warriors for abstract free speech I\u2019ve encountered, who especially elevate the speech of Nazis and their ilk to prove their virtuous fealty to a principle, are white. \n\nUnlike the virtuous, noble (white, as if that matters, but we\u2019re playing race identity politics, so fuck it) warriors for OTHER PEOPLE that you so effortlessly seem to speak for.\n\n&gt;In truth, it\u2019s marginalized people, queer/trans people, women of color, Jewish people like myself, \n\nBen Shapiro 2020 and 2024, nothing ironic about it. Love the guy. He\u2019s a jew (did you know his wife is a doctor? lol). Also, I\u2019m a very staunch supporter of Israel and particularly love UN Watch. \n\nI\u2019m a mensch. \n\nTell you what, though: queer, black, gay, straight, asian, whatever\u2014 people just fucking want to live their lives. MOST OF US consider those aspects of our identities ONLY ASPECTS. pieces of a whole. That you and your ilk seem to focus so readily, so narrowly, so myopically ONLY ON THOSE THINGS, that tells me you are compensating for a deep guilt you cannot fix any other way.\n\nI reject that. \n\n&gt;who often look askance at the tremendous amount of ink spilled by white men defending the untrammeled rights of people who A) say they want to kill us and take away our rights, and B) do so on a regular basis.\n\nI don\u2019t support looney tunes of any stripe. I\u2019m a conservative. You can live how you want to live, but don\u2019t ask me to support you in any other way than the very basic fundamental rights which I also expect- in this instance, the right to disagree. \n\n&gt;We don\u2019t look at racists being too scared to speak and think, \u201cThere but for the grace of God go I,\u201d but instead think, \u201cGood, I can breathe that much easier.\u201d\n\nAgreed! Let\u2019s fight racism because it\u2019s idiotic. Let\u2019s fight sexism for the same reason. Let\u2019s fight Alex Jones and his moronic views exactly as we\u2019ve thus far done- remove him from private platforms that don\u2019t want to be a party to his shitshow, and leave him to the platforms that do. Let\u2019s fight his ideas, but not his right to espouse them. \n\n&gt;The truth is that free speech warriors like yourself aren't actually interested in the well-being of marginalized or oppressed people. \n\nI don\u2019t NEED TO BE, MOTHERFUCKER. I never said I *cared* about you. I don\u2019t know you. I don\u2019t give a shit about you. I give a shit about your rights only insofar as the principal of the thing- I want you to shout as loud as you can, when you want, how you want, so that I ALSO have the right to shout back.\n\n&gt;Your actions are purely performative. \n\nI\u2019m not the one virtue signaling. \n\n&gt;You're demonstrating your loyalty to principles solely by highlighting the worst examples of it. \n\nAnd you want to excise the dirt. I think speech is dirty, and maybe should be. I want dirt, because I want to know how comparatively clean the rest of us are.\n\n&gt;I guarantee you did not have this same visceral outrage when Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor cancelled her speaking tour due to death threats.\n\nI have no idea who that is, but I DON\u2019T agree with shutting someone down in that way (a \u201checkler\u2019s veto\u201d).", "score": 0, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "forwardsfromgrandma", "date_year_month": "2018-08", "created_utc_converted": "2018-08-09 00:36:31", "score_overall": 4, "words": "libel holocaust jewish jew", "shared_words": "libel holocaust jewish jew", "socre_distint": 4}

If some people are allowed to have civil rights, then I think it's fair to say that there shouldn't be any second-class citizens here. Either everyone is equal, or nobody truly is. Since you reference kicking politicians off of property, consider the fact that even Bernie Sanders, your Socialist Jewish hero, who *marched and put his neck on the line and got arrested during the Civil Rights Movement so that people of color could get rights*, said that anyone should be allowed to walk into a restaurant and get service in reference to the Sarah Huckabee Sanders-Red Hen incident.\n\nYes, I did stick up Kaepernick, all throughout, despite strongly, and I mean *strongly*, disagreeing with his message, because I am a free speech absolutist.

My sympathies do lie more with the *alt-right* side of the idpol spectrum, which I guess makes me a \"racist nazi\" subhuman in your view, but I also believe in, like *the Golden Rule* and *being decent to other people*, which sadly in 2018 I guess has become a nazi point of view to the people [who get off with 3 months probation for hitting strangers in the face with bike locks](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2018/08/08/eric-clanton-takes-3-year-probation-deal-in-berkeley-rally-bike-lock-assault-case).\n\nhttp://redditsearch.io/?term=Kaep&amp;authors=darthhayek&amp;dataviz=false&amp;aggs=false&amp;subreddits=&amp;searchtype=posts,comments&amp;search=true&amp;start=0&amp;end=1533680196&amp;size=100\n\nI notice how you couldn't answer whether Ron Paul is a racist neo-nazi, do you think Ron Paul is a racist neo-nazi? How about Gary Johnson? Unlike Rand Paul's position on the public accommodation clause of the Civil Rights Act, Gary Johnson took the opposite route and said that you should force the Jew to bake the Nazi cake. Well, by golly gee, he must be a neo-Nazi to say that! If you're defending the unpersoning of a humble water filter salesman based on unverified claims that he's a \"racist\" and a \"nazi\", then who *don't* you want to censor? Should all libertarians be censored? Who else? Should classical liberals like Dave Rubin, the \"gay Jewish free speech nazi\" be banned? Where does the line end, and how do you know that they'll never come for you, once there's no one left to speak out for you? What makes you think that multinational corporations have your best interests at heart, if they don't even like us free market capitalists?\n\nAnd as for Charlottesville, no, *racists* did not kill Heather Heyer. *A racist* killed Heather Heyer, and there is still no evidence that this was some kind of pre-meditated attack which multiple people were responsible for. *A person* was responsible for it. You are *literally using the same logic racists use* by blaming the actions of a single individual on an entire group.

{"archived": false, "author": "WaltzRoommate", "body": "&gt; You have provided no evidence for this. I set out a perfectly clear explanation of the holocaust and you keep making it out like its a conspiracy.\n\nNo, I'm not a holocaust denier. I'm not much of a denier. Maybe I have some skepticism, but only in an autistic way; it's not ideological. The part where it's propaganda, in my view, isn't that it's a lie that it happened (which btw, is what I think you're asking for evidence for, correct me if I'm wrong, but if I'm right then I won't be showing evidence for this position because I don't believe this position), but rather that we're given emotional one sided appeals for why it's special or why it should matter to us. Propaganda doesn't necessarily mean lies, it just means one sided dishonest argumentation. My \"evidence\" for why it's one sided dishonest argumentation is two fold. The first fold is that it's not only not special, but so obviously not special that the only explanation for it's special treatment is that people in power want it to be special. The second fold, is that Jews are the most powerful demographic in America today with only one caveat. The caveat is that whites are more powerful, but all our power is potential energy because we're gaslit from using it. Of groups using their power, Jews are the most powerful. A plurality or majority of power in the US is exercised either by Jews, or on Jew's behalf.\n\n&gt; That's. The. Issue. And sure, maybe you're just a self centred guy\n\nI'm not self-centered. I'm centered around others. Being alt right takes a tremendous amount of personal risk and commitment that I will personally never see the benefit of. \n\n&gt; but the point of holocaust memorial is that people care about not genociding ever again.\n\nNo, this is totally false. Holocaust propaganda is leading directly to white genocide, or white extinction if you'd prefer the term. The point is not that there are nefarious actors twirling their mustache, but rather that we will go extinct relatively quickly due to Holocaust propaganda. Whether its intended is immaterial; I'd rather prevent it. It's a genocide whether it's intentional or not. I personally believe it to be intentional, but I don't believe that it being intentional matters.\n\n&gt; Again, we should learn about the Armenian genocide just as much, it's just that we don't because of a Turkish lobby, not because da joos only want their own genocide to be taught. \n\nIf, for some reason, the Turks didn't want us to hear about the Holocaust, you know as well as I do that we'd still hear about it. The reason is because Jews are more powerful than Turks. \n\n&gt; I haven't ever seen the mainstream left use the holocaust as a pretext for white guilt. They say stupid shit but it's usually things like Colonialism and how we are responsible for it.\n\nYes you have. Stop this. Aside from this retardation, this has been a good discussion. You know damn well that it's used to invoke white guilt. Just shut up here. Don't taint the discussion. Don't even reply to this section of my reply, just move on like it didn't happen. Don't taint the discussion. You know I'm right about this specific point. \n\n&gt; I'm trying my best with you man, but can you see why a certain historical event is taught, and another is not in this case?\n\nWell, we're debating the reason why it's taught so this is a weird question. I think it's taught because Jews have a lot of power, you think it's taught because it actually is special. Literally the reason for debate. No point in being snooty. \n\n&gt; Good evidence. Damn Jews innit.\n\nDude, bajillions of genocides have happened throughout history and many of them have been much more deliberate and premeditated than the Holocaust. The Carthaginians were wiped out within weeks, because the Romans had a clear genocidal plan. If the Nazis were intending genocide, then they did not think nearly as hard in advance about it. I'd much prefer to learn about the Third Punic War in  depth in school, than spend years on the Holocaust. \n\n&gt; I think you're missing the point of what I mean.\n\nThen explain it more clearly. \n\n&gt; With a genocide right under their nose. Which they didn't care about. Which they committed a few more off. Jesus fucking Christ, you literally have to be a psychopath to be fine with this world view. Not so nice when it's you with a gun pointed to your head. Try to maybe not see everything through your own arrogant eyes? I bet you even talk about the great virtues of Christian civilisation in Europe, whilst holding these views. Disgusting.\n\nLol, taking this moral indignation and accusing me of arrogance is really a \"pick one\" type deal. You have not refuted that the Romans were happy and successful after the Jewish revolts. Do you concede the point?\n\n&gt; The point is that if you want to strip Jews of power because they're predominantly in power, the same applies to the cis white males. And since you don't seem to care about those boring Jewish genocides, you'd surely find no issue with the media and bank controlling whites on the chopping block?\n\nNo, it clearly doesn't apply to us because we are we. That's how power works. When Trajan expelled the Dacian king from power, did it follow that Trajan was then removed? No. When the Jews expelled the Palestinians from power in Israel (P's are still there, but not in power) did it follow that Jews were in power? No. When whites expelled the Natives from power in America, did it follow that we were expelled? No, if we're expelled it's not because of them. \n\n&gt; So you are just the typical alt right guy actually larping to ancient Rome? I thought that it was an exaggerated stereotype, but clearly not so. And before you reply- yes, I know this is not an argument, but a passing comment on an observation I'm making.\n\nI'm gonna be objective here... \n\nAs a stereotype, this is not accurate. Most alt righters aren't Roman LARPers... yet. In fact, like 99.9% of them are not. However, dude I fucking love Rome. I've read shit tons about it, listened to the good historical podcasts, I'm learning Latin, and I'm in the process of converting to Roman Catholicism. I didn't know this even was a stereotype, but I'm honestly like obsessed with it and I know a lot about it. Rome is #1 and I'm pretty sure all white people agree. I'm soon going to be starting a podcast on [this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLziPZRfH3CZEozrVBo7BKw) Youtube channel and my buddy and I are gonna make Rome into a central piece of the alt right. Stay tuned. \n\n&gt; No, it's you who hasn't provided an argument, just a claim about mass immigration.\n\nOkay but what is it about what I said about mass immigration that you take issue with?

I could buy them not wanting to talk to their children about it though. Weird question but are you/your dad Ashkenazi or Sephardic? I found that many Sephardic Jews are very quiet and ashamed of the Holocaust as you described because they didn't go through it, so they wouldn't talk about it. \n\nAnd that aside, you make a good point -- Jews were generally not welcome in the States, which was kind of the point I was trying to make. I felt like a Jewish cop in the south especially, even if he himself didn't think about being Jewish or his family didn't place emphasis on Jewishness, would be reminded that he is on a regular basis. It was the 70s for Christ's sake, were Jews even labelled as white back then?\n\nI guess my point is less about the Holocaust and more about antisemitism - I'm a fan of the phrase \"If you forget that you're Jewish, the goyim will remind you.\" But it didn't feel to me they got the social aspect right and treated Driver's character as if he were a normal white man or something.

{"archived": false, "author": "darthhayek", "body": "&gt;Reading through your various comments in this thread it\u2019s quite clear that you are firmly alt right.\n \nThat seems like an ad hominem attack.\n \n&gt; I don\u2019t think you\u2019re asking this question or having this debate in good faith.\n \nNope.\n \n&gt;White nationalists/supremacists groups have self identified as such.\n \nOkay, but so can globalists. If you're going to pretend that one side of the aisle is \"identiable\" but not the other, then I'm not going to concede that white nationalists and supremacists are real things that exist at all, because that's anti-white and it makes you look like you're only using these phrases as racial slurs. Note that I've never heard of anyone who *seriously\" identifies as a \"white supremish\".\n \n \n&gt;They segregate who can or can\u2019t identify with their cause. They gather in public areas and march espousing their cause. We can clearly identify them and point to them. Hell we have them on fucking tape yelling actual racist shut at Charlottesville.\n \nAnd the other side responds with equivalently racist bullshit.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/R49sFIs.jpg\n\n\nSo, yeah, this is why I have a problem with people who framed Charlottesville as a conflict between \"the forces of evil vs. kind, brave, virtuous anti-racists and warriors of love and tolerance\". This mentality was so common that even mainstream Republicans touted it like McCain, Romney, and Rubio; it's one thing when it's a Democrat, but it's disgusting to me to see \"conservatives\" going out of their way to demonize and throw their own base under the bus. It was objectively closer to what the president said, good and bad and both sides, and I consider anyone who denies this without explaining *how* whites could organize in public legitimately to be racist against whites, because without explaining the proper, non-racist way to do a Charlottesville-style rally, it must be assumed that your argument is *literally* just \"fuck whites\".\n \n&gt;The (((globalists))) do not exist in this capacity. There are political leaders that seek to expand global trade or influence, but they are not exclusively Jewish.\n \nWhere did anyone say they were? Are \"white supremacists\" exclusively White? (Hint: The answer is no) If you can isolate and stigmatize this group of \"white nationalists\" in a specifically racialized manner, then why on earth would it be illegitimate to talk about other groups in such frank terms, too? Do you believe that whites are the only group of people which can be racist?\n \n&gt;And neither are all Jews globalists. \n\nWell, of course, I know that. I grew up with Jews; the vast majority of them are normal people, just like any other race. Just like white gentiles such as myself. Some of the best libertarians throughout the years have been Jews, such as Mises, Rand, Rothbard, Friedman, Block, etc., and some of the best advocates for nationalist causes throughout the \"alt-right\" spheres are Jews, too, such as Paul Gottfried (coined \"alt-right\" and maintains a regular column on LewRockwell.com), Ron Unz, Halsey English, Mike Savage, and youtuber Frame Game Radio, who is one of my favorite commentators within the \"pro-white\" e-celeb sphere. So you seem to be mistaking me for some kind of committed Jew hater merely for defending /u/Saturnspike492's comments as not being *necessarily* racist and comparing them to the kind of rhetoric that I've observed to be *extremely* normalized and propagated throughout the mainstream over my young life. \n\nIf you jump straight from someone criticizing \"Jewish globalists\", as subset of the Jewish people, to assuming that they are expressing a hatred against all Jews, then can you see why I judge \"white nationalist and supremacist\" according to the same standards? Most non self-hating whites regard these as words that are only used by a hostile enemy media to dehumanize us and undermine our interests.\n\n&gt;They do not segregate who can or can\u2019t identify with their cause. There is no organized determinate structure. We can\u2019t clearly identify them and point to them.\n\nUh, what, are you sure?\n\nWould you say that [Bill Kristol](https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/1026119866884005889) and Mark Zuckerberg are not examples of Jewish globalists?\n\nI could entertain the idea that \"Jewish globalism\" if you were consistent and, more importantly, they were consistent and stopped attacking whites, but I can't not notice things that appear to just be a matter of observable fact. For example, I don't care that CNN has a [well-known overrepresentation of Jews](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDwkYXrW0AEH6Nz.jpg), because why would I care about that. As a libertarian and an individualist, it's not your skin color, background or beliefs that matter to me, it's your actions and who you are as a person. In a business setting, it's your ability to do your job. \n\nI don't care about things like \"diversity\" and \"overrepresentation\" because like [Denise Young Smith said](https://theblacksphere.net/2017/11/apple-diversity-chief-resigns-says-white-people-can-be-diverse-too/), the sacked woman of color diversity ex-chief at Apple, \"There can be 12 white, blue-eyed, blonde men in a room, and they\u2019re going to be diverse too, because they\u2019re going to bring a different life experience and life perspective to the conversation.\" Likewise, a room full of 12 Jews can be diverse too, because every Jew is different from every other Jew just like every white is different from every other white. Unfortunately, she lost her job for this.\n\nSo, naturally, this is why I have a problem with it when Jewish media organizations like fake news CNN recycle old-school anti-Semitic canards like \"Jews run Hollywood\" and \"Jews control the banks\" and direct them at white men, like me, arguing that there are \"too many whites\" in fields that are alleged by many to actually be disproportionately and specifically Jewish.\n \nhttps://www.cnn.com/2014/01/23/opinion/kohn-white-male-hollywood/index.html\n\nhttps://money.cnn.com/2014/10/01/investing/wall-street-diversity-problem/index.html\n\nNeedless to say, this is far from the only example of \"too many whites\" journalism coming from Very Fake CNN. I know of even more egregious examples of explicit anti-whiteness, but won't bother adding them to my argument for now.\n\nDo you have a defense for this? Do you support \"diversity\"? Do you think that it would be fair to call people like Bill Kristol, or [Joe Bernstein at Buzzfeed](https://i.redd.it/oc9uzfrcune11.png) \"Jewish globalists\", or at least some kind of anti-white racists motivated by their perceived ethnocentric interests, similar to what white nationalists and supremacists are accused of? Do I have a right to notice that Sarah Jeong's boss at the *New York Times*, Arthur Sulzberger, [is Jewish](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/29/us/politics/trump-new-york-times-sulzberger.html)?\n\nIf you're interested in seeing a short, concise post where I think I did a better job of explaining my argument here and was relatively well-received, you can read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/96cuqq/_/e400tac/). I hope you'll consider it and come back with a better argument than \"durr, shitty whites exist, shitty Jews don't\".\n\n&gt;That there\u2019s some kind of secretive unidentifiable (((globalist))) force making your life suck is just a made up conspiracy by and for the simple minded who easily fall for some scapegoat race that is the root of all of their problems (this is actually what Hitler did). I get it, you aren\u2019t as smart as you thought you were when you were a kid, so you want to blame some conspiracy that worked against you, but it\u2019s time to face the truth, that you aren\u2019t special and you aren\u2019t going to be, and that\u2019s fine.\n \nThen stop spreading conspiracy theories about secret (((white nationalists))) trying to purge white countries of lesser races and exterminate them, because all I hear when you say that is \"these people are nazis and it's okay to kill them because the only good nazi is a dead nazi\". Which starts to sound pretty similar to what stormfags mean when they say white genocide, to me, considering you're the one leading off with accusations of genocidal intent anyway with no proof.\n", "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Libertarian", "date_year_month": "2018-08", "created_utc_converted": "2018-08-12 02:49:29", "score_overall": 17, "words": "jewish jew jewish jewish jewish jewish jew jew jewish jewish jewish jewish globalist conspiracy scapegoat conspiracy conspiracy", "shared_words": "jewish jew globalist conspiracy scapegoat", "socre_distint": 5}

The publisher was arrested and served time in jail for his role in producing and distributing hate literature.\n\nPublisher Simon Sheppard:\n\n&gt;Simon Guy Sheppard (born 1957) is a British extremist from Hull, England, who runs a number of websites promoting his far right, sexist, and racist doctrines; his main website contains many articles about women, the multiracial society and Jews, stating that these have negative effects upon western society and for white males in particular.\n\n&gt;He has been prosecuted three, and imprisoned four times for his ideology: in the Netherlands for Holocaust denial in 1995, in the UK for inciting racial hatred in 1999 and 2000 for a British National Party (BNP) election leaflet, and again in the UK between 2008 and 2011 for publishing material on the Internet that was in breach of racial hatred legislation, after having been subject to a number of raids by police. He was released on licence after serving less than half his sentence to a bail hostel on 17 May 2011 and was banned from accessing the Internet. He was rearrested in January 2013 for breach of his licence conditions and returned to prison in Northallerton.\n\nTales of the Holohoax led to Sheppard's imprisonment for circulating material likely to incite racial hatred, i.e. Tales of the Holohoax.\n\n&gt;In 2004 a complaint had been made regarding an anti-Semitic comic book called Tales of the Holohoax (the script of which was written by Michael A. Hoffman II) after it was pushed through the door of a synagogue in Blackpool, Lancashire. Subsequently, it was traced back to a post office box in Hull registered to Sheppard...\n\n&gt;In 2005, Sheppard's house was raided by police following complaints about allegedly racist material published by his Heretical Press.\n\n&gt;In 2008, Sheppard was arrested in the UK, from the investigation that started in 2004, and charged with using his website to circulate \"material likely to incite racial hatred\". The website is based in Torrance, California, so Sheppard rejects English legal jurisdiction over the published writings. Sheppard and his associate Steven Whittle absconded from bail, took a ferry to Ireland, and flew to Los Angeles, USA. After they demanded political asylum, the pair were put into Santa Ana Jail.\n\n&gt;On 24 March 2009, the two appellants addressed the California court themselves before Judge Rose Peters. According to the neo-Nazi website Lasha Darkmoon, the two men claimed their actions in England were legal because they were based around the Edict of Expulsion of 1290 when England expelled all Jews living in the country at the time, and the two said that since the Edict has never been repealed--like all Royal decrees, it could only be canceled by a living King or Queen of England--their anti-Semitic views were backed by British law and they were eligible for asylum due to being persecuted for their beliefs. On 5 April 2009, with reasons reserved, Sheppard and Whittle were denied asylum, upon which the former stated that they would not appeal, and they were deported and returned to prison in the United Kingdom on 17 June 2009. On 10 July 2009, Sheppard was sentenced to 4 years and 10 months in prison, and his co-defendant, Whittle, was convicted of five similar offences. These sentences for publishing material on the Internet were described as \"groundbreaking\" by Adil Khan, representing Humberside police, whilst Sheppard's lawyer, Adrian Davies, said in his defence during the trial that he had come from a \"very troubled background\" and revealed that his mother had committed suicide, whilst noting that Sheppard was an intelligent man who had problems with authority, especially the police. In January 2010, Sheppard and Whittle lost an appeal against their convictions, but succeeded in having their sentences reduced slightly.\n\nFrom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Sheppard_(activist)\n\nAnd Michael Hoffman is the author of Tales of the Holohoax: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Hoffman_II\n\n**Tales of the Holohoax led to the publisher's arrest and imprisonment.

Some guys just don\u2019t have all the luck.\n\nImagine how maddening, for example, it must have been to appear on stage in London at an event\u00a0with Leila Khaled, former leading member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a terrorist group that has been linked to the stabbing of Jewish children and the setting about of rabbis with meat cleavers. Khaled herself, in fact, was involved in a couple of sporty plane hijackings, memorably surprising authorities by producing hand grenades on a flight from Amsterdam to New York in 1970. Corbyn \u2013 no doubt utterly well intentioned \u2013 used the 2002 London event merely to call for a complete international trade boycott on Israel, but it was plane-jacker Khaled who stole the show. It\u2019s the sort of thing that could happen to anyone.\n\nYes there was that nonsense about inviting representatives from terrorist organisations Hamas and Hezbollah to Parliament in 2009 and referring to them as \u2018our friends\u2019. But you don\u2019t make a Middle East peace omelette without breaking a few eggs. No one could have been more shocked than him, surely, when some smartarse got hold of the 1988 Hamas Covenant and discovered the bit about \u2018so-called peaceful solutions and international conferences\u2019 being \u2018in contradiction of the principles of the Islamic Resistance Movement\u2026There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through jihad.\u2019 A simple mistake.\n\nI know, I know.

Also, how come (according to you folks) Stalin oversaw the seeding of false Holocaust proofs while at the same time persecuting the Jews, all while fighting to the last man against anti-Jew Nazi Germany and after killing millions in a genocide (Holodomor) you seem to claim was staged by the Jews. \n\nStalin was a twat obssesed with power who did not care what he did to keep it, that is it. \n\n&gt;Obviously.

{"archived": false, "author": "MMSTINGRAY", "body": "I disagree with you defence of the comparison as reasonable but you are 100% correct it's not a comparison to the Holocaust. \n\nHowever the comparison is still bad because 30s Germany, Hitler and the Nazis are  not really comparable. Remember Hitler wrote Mein Kampf in the 20s, the Nazis anti-semitic ideas weren't snuck in but were a rallying cry. Germans knew and supported the anti-Jewish program even some of the people who thought camps were ' a bit much', I'm not just talking about the crime of inaction but active support.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/feb/17/johnezard\n\nIn the 20s Hitler had already declared Jews sneaky and untrustworthy, as aligned with Marxism as part of conspiracy and a million other anti-semitic things, I'm sure I don't need to list them all.\n\nSo we have Corbyn who, if anti-semitic, manifests it by a kind of ignorance or blind spot to Jewish people. No one has accused him of openly supporting violence against Jews, and even his harshest critics normally fall short of this being his intention. His baggage is mainly attending meetings that people find offensive but rarely having said anything himself that is a problem. For the sake of argument we'll assume he is an anti-semite though.\n\nThen you have Hitler who's baggage in the '30s was not that he spoke at a meeting with an anti-semite or a terrorist. But he wrote a book which said things like\n\n&gt;Was there any shady undertaking, any form of foulness, especially in cultural life, in which at least one Jew did not participate? On putting the probing knife carefully to that kind of abscess one immediately discovered, like a maggot in a putrescent body, a little Jew who was often blinded by the sudden light.\n\nHe didn't perhaps unfairly focus on the crimes of one side of a conflict where both sides have committed crimes but fabricated a Jewish conspiracy theory as to why Germany lost the war \n\n&gt;I believe that our present generation would easily master this danger if they were rightly led. For this generation has gone through certain experiences, which must have strengthened the nerves of all those who did not become nervously broken by them. Certainly in days to come, the Jews will raise a tremendous cry throughout their newspapers, once the hand is laid on their favourite net. Once the move is made to put an end to this scandalous press and once this instrument which is public opinion is brought under state control and no longer left in the hands of aliens and enemies of the people. I am certain that this will be easier for us than it was for our fathers. The scream of the twelve-inch shrapnel is more penetrating than the hiss from a thousand Jewish newspaper vipers. Therefore let them go on with their hissing.\n\n...\n\n&gt;    But it remained for the Jews, with their unqualified capacity for falsehood, and their fighting comrades, the Marxists...by placing responsibility for the loss of the World War on the shoulders of Ludendorff they took away the weapon of moral right from the only adversary dangerous enough to be likely to succeed in bringing the betrayers of the Fatherland to Justice. All this was inspired by the principle\u2014 which is quite true in itself \u2014 that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously.\n\nNot from Mein Kampf but still from the 20s\n\n&gt;Since we are socialists, we must necessarily also be antisemites because we want to fight against the very opposite: materialism and mammonism\u2026 How can you not be an antisemite, being a socialist! \n\nand\n\n&gt;There are only two possibilities in Germany; do not imagine that the people will forever go with the middle party, the party of compromises; one day it will turn to those who have most consistently foretold the coming ruin and have sought to dissociate themselves from it. And that party is either the Left: and then God help us! for it will lead us to complete destruction - to Bolshevism, or else it is a party of the Right which at the last, when the people is in utter despair, when it has lost all its spirit and has no longer any faith in anything, is determined for its part ruthlessly to seize the reins of power - that is the beginning of resistance of which I spoke a few minutes ago. Here, too, there can be no compromise - there are only two possibilities: either victory of the Aryan, or annihilation of the Aryan and the victory of the Jew. \n\nand\n\n&gt;Once I really am in power, my first and foremost task will be the annihilation of the Jews. As soon as I have the power to do so, I will have gallows built in rows\u2014at the Marienplatz in Munich, for example\u2014as many as traffic allows. Then the Jews will be hanged indiscriminately, and they will remain hanging until they stink; they will hang there as long as the principles of hygiene permit. As soon as they have been untied, the next batch will be strung up, and so on down the line, until the last Jew in Munich has been exterminated. Other cities will follow suit, precisely in this fashion, until all Germany has been completely cleansed of Jews. \n\nand\n\n&gt;The bourgeoisie rules by intrigue, but it can have no foothold in my movement because we accept no Jews or Jewish accomplices into our Party\n\nThis is without even getting into the 30s or 40s! The situation is just incomparable even if Corbyn is an anti-semite.\n\nIf Corbyn is secretly using his popularity and trust from his supporters to push anti-semitism that is not what Hitler did. Hitler was already in accordance with many many Germans and stoked the fires and emboldened them. Even if Corbyn is an anti-semite there is no evidence that anti-semitism is as prevelant in Britain as 30s Germany, and certainly none that the signs of anti-semitism currently in the Labour party are comparable to the signs of anti-semitism in the Nazi party.\n\nIf we say Corbyn is a big fat racist liar it still means he is lying about his racism, something else Hitler didn't really do.  \n\nIt's incomparable in far more ways than it is comparable. If we apply hindsight even more so. I don't think anyone thinks Corbyn's aim is a Jewish holocaust, I think even those who he think he is an anti-semite don't seriously doubt he'd support a two-state solution for peace.\n\nI think even if we ignore our hindsight, and assume Corbyn is an anti-semite, it's clear the parallels are shaky and superficial.

When you think of it, \"ban that speech because it offends me\" is a core component of SJW identity politics, and I don't see it as any less SJW when it involves political Zionism rather than a more pinkish or rainbowy cause.\n\nI got most of my information about the Jeremy Corbyn and the IHRA definition controversy from the Jewish youtuber Frame Game Radio, who makes an excellent series of videos on what he terms the \"diversity industry\". Over the last month or so, he's made a number of streams about this issue, too, since he regards it as a major freedom of speech issue.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2pR6srqlLDk\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qG7FKNPvkyg\n\n If you want my personal opinion, I don't actually care much about the same points that Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party are disputing, outside of the principle of the matter, since for the most part, I tend to find myself in agreement with most of Israel's domestic policies or at least extraordinarily sympathetic to them. The one that actually stands out the most to me is (2), since while on the one hand, as someone who grew up with Jews, I can certainly agree that old-school anti-Semitic canards like \"Jews run Hollywood\"  or \"Jews run the banks\" are quite ugly, and don't really deserve a fair hearing in polite society.... that's also how my own people have been getting talked about for, like, the last 5-10 years, like [articles](https://www.cnn.com/2014/01/23/opinion/kohn-white-male-hollywood/index.html) such as [these](https://money.cnn.com/2014/10/01/investing/wall-street-diversity-problem/index.html) from CNN prove. And you can ask HanAssholeSolo if anyone's ever criticized CNN's own lack of diversity, so to speak. &gt;_&gt; So, yeah, when I see politicians like Nikki Haley brag before AIPAC about how she basically puts the interests of a foreign state over her own, or Theresa May grilling Corbyn on how hostile he is to the Jews while at the same time lecturing Donald Trump on how saying \"Britain First\" is fascist hate speech, that's the kind of stuff that gives me a chip on my shoulder and makes me feel taken advantage of. While I still lean towards being a free speech absolutist, it'd be kind of nice if the \"anti-anti-Semitism\" activists could work on making anti-whiteness a thing worth caring about, too, since I think we deserve to get thrown a bone for being such good allies over all these years. &lt;_&lt; You get where I'm coming from?\n\nI hope I didn't say anything that comes off too offensive in my post. It may seem like I went off on a tangent or 2, but I've liked some of your posts before, and I've actually been interested in hashing out some of these issues with you for a while. :3", "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Conservative", "date_year_month": "2018-08", "created_utc_converted": "2018-08-18 18:44:05", "score_overall": 11, "words": "holocaust jewish conspiracy jewish jewish holocaust holocaust jewish jewish libel jewish", "shared_words": "holocaust jewish conspiracy libel", "socre_distint": 4}

Ford, who routinely appears on British media [defending the Assad regime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVevIuIRuok) line on Syria, should be more accurately referred to as director of the [pro-Assad lobby group](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/22/former-uk-ambassador-linked-to-assad-lobby-group/), the British Syrian Society, founded by Bashar al-Assad\u2019s father-in-law Fawaz Akhras.\n\nBoth Robinson and Ford appeared on the festival line-up alongside Beeley and Williamson. They were opposed by Peter Tatchell. Speaking after the event Tatchell said:\u00a0\n\n&gt;\u201cThere was a vote at the Syria debate at the Beautiful Days festival: Who agrees with Peter Ford (who took the Vanessa Beeley line, including claiming that the Syria democracy movement was \"mythical\") and who agrees with Peter Tatchell?

Speaking to the *New Statesman,*\u00a0Carrie\u00a0accused Beeley of anti-Semitic abuse, claiming\u00a0her purpose was to \u201cslander journalists and stir up hatred\u201d.\n\nResponding to Williamson\u2019s endorsement of Beeley, Eve Sacker, a Jewish constituent of Williamson,\u00a0[tweeted](https://twitter.com/Sheitl1973/status/1031553458690772994): \u201cThere is a tiny community of just over 100 Jews in Derby. I don\u2019t trust him to represent us.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the mountain of complaints against Williamson by Labour members and even [loyal Corbyn supporters](https://twitter.com/MikeSegalov/status/1024269113290633216), he has been continually endorsed by noteable pro-Corbyn activists such as Novara Media\u2019s [Aaron Bastani](https://twitter.com/AaronBastani/status/1029490698800832514) and [Ash Sarkar](https://twitter.com/DerbyChrisW/status/1018736992899796992), providing him with a youthful platform to reach new audiences that he may have otherwise not had.\n\nWhile the who\u2019s who of crankery on display at the Beautiful Days festival is worthy of independent condemnation, the endorsement of Beeley by Williamson represents an attack on public decency and human rights from a sitting Labour MP.\n\nThe dangers of this endorsement cannot be taken lightly. Not just from how the disinformation machine now has new content but also, as Amnesty International UK\u2019s campaigns manager Kristyan Benedict says, it suggests that the Labour party had a \u201c[human rights problem](https://twitter.com/KreaseChan/status/1031267938068832257)\u201d and that such an endorsement \u201c[isn\u2019t a one-off](https://twitter.com/KreaseChan/status/1031271367453417474)\u201d among Corbyn supporters.\n\nWith seemingly no censure from the Labour party for Williamson\u2019s increasingly offensive behaviour, his endorsement of Vanessa Beeley will be greeted as a dog-whistle by conspiracy theorists. By refusing to distance themselves from Williamson, the Labour leadership and pro-Corbyn media voices are indicating that war crimes denial, anti-Semitism and extremism is tolerated within the Labour party.\n\nThere is a war for the heart of the Labour party underway, ultimately Labour cannot be both the party of Jo Cox and the party of Chris Williamson. If Williamson\u2019s latest endorsement receives no censure from the Labour leader\u2019s office, the answer to that question will be heard loudly and clearly all the way from Westminster to Damascus.\n\n*Oz Katerji is a\u00a0writer,\u00a0filmmaker and journalist with a focus on the Middle East, and former Lesvos coordinator for British charity Help Refugees.\u200b*", "score": 17, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "LabourUK", "date_year_month": "2018-08", "created_utc_converted": "2018-08-21 10:29:51", "score_overall": 5, "words": "holocaust holocaust jew jewish conspiracy", "shared_words": "holocaust jew jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

They key part of enemy structure is Open Borders Society. Globalism is a Neo-fascist belief system that abandoned the Nation for a singular transnational power. \nThe western-patriated urban Jews are tools of Globalism not the principle actors. The communists would call them useful idiots. This is incidental and they are no more important to this movement than any other demographic the Globalists can divide away from their home country. Given their comparatively low numbers, perhaps they are less important than disenfranchised urban blacks or single mothers.\nThe cultural segregated ghettos and enclaves of Western countries are power bases for the Globalists. If we weren't being wedged apart and these populaces could be assimilated into the nation they reside within there would be no power base for our enemies. \nSoros and company are vile miscreants who prey on all the groups they present to advertising cate for including those Jews. If it made sense for Soros to put them in camps on the way to the furnace (again) he would do it without blinking.

The ministry employed some of the finest writing talents of the age, including appointing Laurie Lee as publications editor.\n\nThe future poet laureate John Betjeman, working on government films, immortalised in verse his muse \u201cMiss Joan Hunter Dunn\u201d, whom he found there doing the catering. Yet the ministry remained unloved.\n\nGraham Greene, a recruit, recalled \u201cthe high heartless building with complicated lifts and long passages like those of a liner and lavatories where the water never ran hot and the nail-brushes were chained like Bibles. Central heating gave it a stuffy smell of mid-Atlantic except in the passages where the windows were always open for fear of blast and the cold winds whistled in.\u201d\n\nGeorge Orwell\u2019s wife worked in its censorship division, while the author himself broadcast ministry-approved propaganda at the BBC.\n\nIn Orwell\u2019s novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, a thinly disguised Senate House served as the Ministry of Truth where Winston Smith worked.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Truth \u2014 Minitrue, in Newspeak \u2014 was startlingly different from any other object in sight. It was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where Winston stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party:\n\nWAR IS PEACE\nFREEDOM IS SLAVERY\nIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.\u201d\n\nThere has been speculation that Big Brother was deliberately given the same initials as Brendan Bracken.\n\nThe Ministry\u2019s ham-fisted meddling extended to refusing permission for Coward\u2019s classic wartime morale-boosting movie In Which We Serve, with officials complaining that \u201cthe film was exceedingly bad propaganda for the Navy, as it showed one of HM\u2019s ships being sunk by enemy action\u201d.\n\nThe story was inspired by the loss of HMS Kelly, captained by Lord Mountbatten, who saved the movie by submitting a script to George VI. Filming went ahead after the King wrote that \u201cthe spirit which animates the Royal Navy is clearly brought out in the men\u201d. It won an Oscar.\n\nThe ministry was quickly closed down in peacetime and replaced by the more modest Central Office of Information.\n\n----\n\nCHAPTER FOUR  \n\u201cNothing to suggest organised activity\u201d\n\nThrough much of continental Europe, Jewish people in countries falling to the Nazis were rounded up and sent for slaughter.\n\nJews in Britain expected the same fate if the Germans invaded. \u201cSome East End Jews, knowing what had been done to their compatriots by the Nazis in Germany, made ready for the coming of Hitler by carrying pellets of poison,\u201d wrote R G Burnett in These My Brethren. \u201cThere was a moment when some began to trek out of London, pushing their belongings on handcarts, like the continental refugees in countries overrun by the Germans.\u201d\n\nAn Eastender born in 1902 told the Jewish Museum London\u2019s oral histories that he believed that British antisemites would not have bothered to gas Jews, as Hitler had done: \u201cI\u2019ve always maintained it, if they had their way here . . . while you\u2019re alive, they would absolutely chop lumps off you. They wouldn\u2019t wait to put you in a gas chamber, they\u2019d be so eager to get at you.\u201d\n\nThe British government\u2019s only wartime acknowledgement of the Holocaust came in 1942 when Anthony Eden, the foreign secretary, told the House of Commons that \u201cthe German authorities are now carrying into effect Hitler\u2019s oft-repeated intention to exterminate the Jewish people in Europe\u201d.\n\nScepticism remained. Victor Cavendish-Bentinck, chairman of the joint intelligence committee, regarded the reported use of gas chambers as an exaggeration by Jews \u201cto stoke us up\u201d, according to Tony Kushner in The Persistence of Prejudice. \u201cDoubts of the atrocity stories, based on distrust of Jewish sources, continued in government circles until the end of the war,\u201d Professor Kushner wrote.\n\nOn June 2 1943, the Lvov ghetto in Poland was liquidated by the Nazis and the last of the city\u2019s 110,000 Jews were sent to a concentration camp.\n\nThe same day, it fell to Margaret Corbett Ashby to struggle to sound the alarm about rising antisemitism in Britain.\n\nMrs Corbett Ashby had begun her political activism campaigning for women to have the vote, creating a group called the Younger Suffragists when she was 18 at the turn of the century.\n\nNow 61, she was the grande dame of English liberalism and was invited to a meeting of the committee advising Bracken. She confided her concerns that Jews in Britain were facing increasing hostility and prejudice. Doubtless she was heard in respectful silence. Behind her back, though, officials treated her warning with disdain.\n\nOne civil servant responded by leafing through issues of the Home Office Special Branch\u2019s fortnightly summary. In a paper marked \u201cSecret\u201d he wrote to a colleague that the following were the only examples of anti-Jewish action that he could find.\n\n\u2022November 15 1942: Large numbers of an antisemitic [sticker] portraying two Jews and bearing the words \u201cBritannia rules the waves \u2014 yeth, but we rule Britannia\u201d found affixed to doors and windows of business premises in Shoreditch, east London.\n\n\u2022January 1-15 1943: A Fascist typewritten broadsheet called The Flame featured antisemitism.\n\n\u2022March 16-31 1943: A pamphlet by R D Lees, who formed a branch of the wartime far-right movement the British National Party in Blackpool, argued that antisemitism was provoked by Jews. He opposed any measures for succouring Jews now under Nazi domination.\n\n\u2022March 1943: Antisemitic slogans chalked and painted on walls and pavements in London districts and in Old Trafford, Manchester.

At Hove, typewritten slips bearing the words \u201cDown with the filthy Jews\u201d were found fixed to shop windows of a tobacconist and confectioners, the proprietor of which was Jewish, and to the windows of a Jewish hotel.\n\n\u2022April 1-15 1943: Edward Godfrey of the British National Party bought 1,000 copies of the antisemitic booklet The Truth About The Jews published by Alexander Ratcliffe of the British Protestant League, Glasgow.\n\n\u2022April 16-30: Antisemitic notices such as \u201cburn the Jews\u201d were chalked on five occasions in the Paddington area of west London. Slogans were chalked on a wall in Old Trafford.\n\nThe civil servant wrote: \u201cYou will agree that there is nothing in all this to suggest anything in the nature of organised activity, at any rate on an important scale.\u201d\n\nA scrawled response to the typed memorandum states: \u201cI did not think that Mrs Corbett Ashby\u2019s account showed signs of careful consideration.\u201d\n\nNearly all the Jews from Lvov would be killed by November.\n\nOnce the war ended, there was a price to pay for the British authorities\u2019 tolerance of antisemitism.\n\nA shop in London run by Victor Burgess, who had been temporarily interned as a suspected enemy sympathiser under the same defence regulations as Sir Oswald and his wife Lady Diana Mosley, was issuing \u201canti-Jewish propaganda\u201d, officials were told in January 1945. The Home Office was alerted but did nothing. Burgess persisted to become a notorious post-war fascist orator.\n\nReturning from the war, appalled Jewish ex-servicemen formed the 43 Group, which physically smashed up Mosley\u2019s gatherings and attacked fascists and antisemites. \u201cAny six of us was more than a match for 20 of them. We never failed, we always won. We always closed their meetings down, never failed to close a meeting down,\u201d Len Sherman, a martial arts expert from the Welsh Guards, told the Jewish Museum London\u2019s oral history collection.\n\nIn 1947 anti-Jewish riots spread through many parts of Britain, triggered by the hanging of two British sergeants in Palestine by the Irgun, an insurrectionary Jewish paramilitary group. A crowd of 700 broke windows at Jewish-owned shops in Eccles, Manchester. Anti-semitic slogans and the fascist sign were daubed on a synagogue in Plymouth. There were days of rioting in Liverpool. Slaughtermen at Birkenhead refused to handle kosher meat.\n\nOfficials had turned a blind eye to latent antisemitism throughout the war. When the Ministry of Information staged a touring show, The Evil We Fight, highlighting Nazi atrocities to rouse the public against Hitler in 1944, copies of a subversive pamphlet were found stuffed into exhibition screens.\n\nThe typewritten, two-page tract warned that parliament was controlled by \u201cThe City of London International Jew Finance\u201d and rejoiced that \u201cHitler is ridding the world of Jews and Judaism\u201d. Condemning the British authorities, it said: \u201cThey lock up Fascists who at least want Britain for the British and clear the country of these slimy, oily, greasy, immoral Jewish dagoes . . . ANTI-SEMITISM MUST BE ENCOURAGED! Britain for the British and to Hell with Jews and all other alien swine.\u201d\n\nOne official wrote: \u201cIt is my opinion that the open letter to Fellow-Britons is not antisemitism \u2014 it is pure German propaganda. Antisemitism is merely a part of the whole.\u201d\n\nAnother commented in a handwritten note that it was childish nonsense which left him quite unconcerned.

Smaller communities of Bashkirs also live in the Republic of Tatarstan, Perm Krai, Chelyabinsk, Orenburg, Tyumen, Sverdlovsk, Kurgan Oblasts and other regions of Russia, as well as in Kazakhstan and other countries.\n\n&gt;Regarding Y-DNA haplogroups genetic studies have revealed that the dominant frequency for Bashkir males is for haplogroup R1b (R-M269 and R-M73) which is, on average, 47.6%. The Y-DNA haplogroup R-M269 (R1b1a2) is dominant among the Basques in western Europe. Following are the haplogroup R1a at the average frequency of 26,5%, and haplogroup N1c at 17%. In lower frequencies were also found haplogroups J2, C, O, E1b, G2a, L, N1b, I, T.[8] The main branch of R1a in Bashkirs is Z93, specifically Z2125, which peaks in Central Asia, among Bashkirs at 31%. Despite the Bashkirs being Turkic peoples, the haplogroups R1b and R1a is mostly linked with Indo-Europeans.\n\nThe Bashkirs are an Interesting case of a healthy formed Hapas related group \n\n&gt;Most mtDNA haplogroups found in Bashkirs (60\u201365%) consist of the haplogroups G, D, \u0421, Z and F; which are lineages characteristic of East Eurasian populations. On the other hand, mtDNA haplogroups characteristic of European and Near Eastern populations were also found in significant amounts (35\u201340%).\n\n&gt;According to the study Suslova et al. 2015: \"The Bashkirs appear close to Mongoloids in allele and haplotype distribution. However, Bashkirs cannot be labelled either as typical Mongoloids or as Caucasoids. Thus, Bashkirs possess some alleles and haplotypes frequent in Mongoloids, which supports the Turkic impact on Bashkir ethnogenesis, but also possess the AH 8.1 haplotype, which could evidence an ancient Caucasoid population that took part in their ethnic formation... Bashkirs showed no features of populations with a substantial Finno-Ugric component, for example Chuvashes or Russian Saami. This disputes the commonly held belief of a Finno-Ugric origin for Bashkirs...\"\n\nNow the difference between Bashkirs and Anatolian Turks is that Bashkirs have had that distinct ethnic-identity formed whereas Anatolian Turks have, for the past century, been fed a bullshit ethnic dysphoric propaganda \n\nTrue nationalism of Anatolian Turks would be [Anatolianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_nationalism#Anatolianism)\n\n&gt;\"Anatolianism\" (Turkish: Anadoluculuk) takes as its starting point that the main source of Turkish culture should be Anatolia (Anadolu), and the main base of this thought is that the Turkish people had built a quite new civilization in Anatolia after 1071 when they won at the Battle of Manzikert. In the early Republican era, some intellectuals proposed that the origins of the Turkish nationalism should be sought in Anatolia, not in \"Turan\".\n\n\n\nAs far as appearances go, it varies. Some of them are definitely aesthetically identitical to greeks. Some of them have the more Turkic central asian appearance. Some have a more Levantine or Arab background. \n\n\n\nAgain, unfortunately, those Anatolians were fed Jewish propaganda that there [were \"racist right wing death squads coming to kill all the mixed race people\"](http://www.armeniangenocidedebate.com/turkish-nationalism)\n\n&gt;**As a response to Anti-Turkish Nationalism that had begun to ethnically cleanse Anatolia, Turks united** behind Mustafa Kemal Ataturk to defend themselves from utter destruction, brought upon various rebellions in the Ottoman lands and the Entente powers marching their armies across Anatolia guided by hundreds of thousands of local non-Muslims sick of Ottoman rule.\n\n\nReading this \"Armenian genocide debate\" website is honestly difficult for me because I can just FEEL the Anomie-Propaganda undercurrents in the bullshit this guy writes. Here's some more gems:\n\n&gt;Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's speeches clarified that everyone knows the many different ethnicities and religions their ancestors are from, but to create unity and success, people need to put aside their differences and past history as it only fuels hatred and revenge. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk said that **no matter what ethnicity or religion as long as you want to be a Turk you are a Turk.**\n\nWhat's funny about this propaganda website I quoted is that TIL the Armenians and Greeks who were slaughtered were also Turks, because there were literally Armenians and Greeks who desperately converted to Islam and [tried to do whatever they could to not be killed, and they were slaughtered anyway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide)\n\n&gt;Arnold Toynbee writes that \"the Young Turks made Pan-Islamism and Turkish Nationalism work together for their ends, but the development of their policy shows the Islamic element receding and the Nationalist gaining ground\".[39] Toynbee and various other sources report that many Armenians were spared death by marrying into Turkish families or converting to Islam. **Concerned that Westerners would come to regard the \"extermination of the Armenians\" as \"a black stain on the history of Islam, which the ages will not efface\", El-Ghusein also observes that many Armenian converts were put to death**.[38]:39 **In one instance, when an Islamic leader appealed to spare Armenian converts to Islam, El-Ghusein quotes a government official as responding that \"politics have no religion\", before sending the converts to their deaths.**\n\nWhats really funny is that some \"Jewish scholars\" tried to put the blame on Islam. Criticize Islam all you want, but Islam was not responsible for this genocide. You can go on the muslim subreddit and you will see virtually everyone in allignment that the Armenian Holocaust happened, and it was a bad thing.\n\n&gt;Bat Ye'or has suggested that \"the genocide of the Armenians was a jihad\".[36] Ye'or holds jihad and what she calls \"dhimmitude\" to be among the \"principles and values\" that led to the Armenian Genocide. \n\n\n&gt;This perspective is challenged by F\u00e0'iz el-Ghusein, a Bedouin Arab witness of the Armenian persecution, whose 1918 treatise aimed \"to refute beforehand inventions and slanders against the Faith of Islam and against Moslems generally ... [W]hat the Armenians have suffered is to be attributed to the Committee of Union and Progress ... [I]t has been due to their nationalist fanaticism and their jealousy of the Armenians, and to these alone; the Faith of Islam is guiltless of their deeds\".\n\nMeanwhile there are Jewish groups that [call Armenian people \"Aunty Semitic\"](https://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/22114)\n\n&gt;In a key symptom inherent in oppressed, closed and wholly mono-ethnic societies, Armenia is cited as the least tolerant towards Jews among 18 countries in Central and Eastern Europe in data published by the Pew Research Center on March 28. Fully, 32 percent of Armenian survey respondents said they would not even accept Jews as fellow citizens. That figure is jarring, but actually, not surprising.\n\n&gt;The Pew data, which was based on a survey conducted from June 2015 to July 2016, affirms previous polling by the Anti-Defamation League in 2014, which showed a majority of Armenians believe that a host of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories are \u201cprobably true,\u201d including that Jews have too much power in the business world (72 percent) and in international financial markets (68 percent), Jews are more loyal to Israel...\n\n\n&gt;\u201cMany Armenian nationalists adopted this ridiculous theory,\u201d wrote Danielyan. \u201cThose nationalist forces became more active during the past couple of years by spreading their Anti-Jew[ish] comments in the press. The most influential representative of the \u2018Tribe Worshippers,\u2019 Armen Avetisyan, was the most talked about figure in the [Armenian] media throughout 2003-2004. In one of the interviews, Avetisyan threatened to exile all Jews from Armenia. Even owner of the ALM television network Tigran Karapetyan enjoyed cursing the Jews.\u201d\n\n&gt;Danielyan also noted that in 2006, the local Jewish community invited various Armenian government officials and public figures to an International Holocaust Remembrance Day event at Yerevan\u2019s Holocaust memorial, but \u201conly one of them, National Assembly MP Mkrtich Minasyan, decided to be present at the ceremony.\u201d\n\n&gt;In Armenia, even the \u201cJewishness\u201d of the head of the Jewish community seems to be somewhat in dispute. Various experts have cited evidence and others have pondered whether the purported President of the Jewish community of Armenia, Rima Varzhapetyan, is even Jewish. Many believe she is a shill for the pervasively anti-Semitic government. To the Pew data, Varzhapetyan responded, \u201cI\u2019ve read it and I was genuinely surprised. Certainly, there can be cases based on household issues, but in general this can\u2019t be true. I believe this is a provocation. I\u2019ve been in numerous countries and I\u2019ve never felt anti-Semitism from Armenians.

{"archived": false, "author": "CertifiedRabbi", "body": "I don't think that it's a good idea to make blatant statements either way in relation to the accusation that Jews use their White phenotype as a kind of camouflage in order to deceive, exploit, and subvert Whites. It's stupid to argue that all Jews do this because most Jews are normies. But anyone who's researched Jewish history and Jewish political activism knows that this is a very real tactic that even Jews themselves openly discuss. \n\nAnd Jews don't just do this to we White gentiles. They do it to Arab gentiles as well. It's really common for Arab-looking Jews (especially Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews) that also speak Arabic to infiltrate Arab countries and Arab organizations in the West in order to spy on them and subvert them. It's also extremely common for Arabs to argue that jihadist groups have been infiltrated and covertly supported by crypto-Jewish/Israeli agents in order to sow chaos in their countries and fuel global Islamophobia - which Jews obviously mock as unhinged conspiracy theories, but I wouldn't be surprised if that was indeed true. \n\nOn a similar note, they also pretend to be Nazis and anti-Jewish White nationalists in order to spy on and subvert those movements as well. Or they'll intentionally signal boost anti-Jewish extremists and try to make them even more extreme in order point to them as proof that hate speech laws need to be passed or to bolster the narrative that Jews are persecuted victims so that people support Israel and send in more donations to organizations like the ADL. \n\nADL operatives have also been known to infiltrate and subvert progressive leftist groups that oppose Zionism and support the Palestinians by showing up to their meetings and passing out flyers that deny the holocaust and whatnot in an effort to make them look unhinged. \n\nAnd of course Jews are more than happy for people to view them as just another White person so that the public doesn't realize that they control Hollywood, the news media, the financial system, the social sciences, et cetera. And the \"My fellow White people...\" [insert do something self-destructive here] has become a meme on the Alt-Right because it's quite a real thing that Jews do indeed like to do. \n\nJews also have a long history of changing their names in order to fit in with the locals so that the locals don't realize that Jews are working together to exploit and subvert them. All of the communist Jews that changed their names in the Soviet Union were a perfect example of that, as are all of the celebrity Jews in Hollywood.\n\nAnother perfect example of Jews lying about their identity just happened on Jean-Francois Gariepy's latest stream. I cringed pretty hard when JF was debating this liberal guy called \"The Liberal Sanity Project\" on his stream two days ago. JF decided to use his closing remark in the debate to ask this liberal guy if he had any Jewish ancestors. When the guy chuckled, denied being Jewish, and mocked his question, I died a little bit inside because it reinforced the stereotype that the Alt-Right has become excessively paranoid and conspiratorial in relation to the JQ. But then JF's fanbase looked through this guy's social media content in order to prove that [**he did indeed have Jewish ancestry and flat out lied about it**](https://youtu.be/vizuU7EnCh4?t=1m20s)... \n\nLike JF, I too profiled this guy's thought patterns and accent and detected some Jewish ancestry (I know that it sounds crazy, but you really can pick up on this kind of subtle stuff if you're as obsessed about race as we are). But I still never would have just blurted out the \"Are you Jewish???\" question like JF did because I wouldn't want to risk being embarrassed by looking paranoid. Luckily for JF and the larger Alt-Right, his psychological profiling and intuition was on point because the guy really was a stereotypical crypto-Jew. \n\nBut some Jews do indeed genuinely view themselves as White. I personally don't have a problem with that. As I wrote in more detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAltRight/comments/95zuql/it_seems_like_many_jews_get_treated_like_whites/e3wwrzu/), I actually think that it's a good thing that most Jews view themselves as White now. Hopefully that will cause normie Jews to be opposed to the anti-White agenda that their fellow Jews played a central role in fomenting. \n\nAs a kind of compromise on this issue, my advice is to just be aware of the fact that Jews have a known history of deception that exceeds the levels of deception practiced by other ethnic groups. I mean, it makes sense for Jews to be more deceptive than other ethnic groups because they've pretty much always been a tiny, vulnerable minority within a much larger host population. And they have an uncanny ability to quickly gain control over their larger gentile host populations. That doesn't mean that all Jews fit the le happy merchant meme, but like most stereotypes - they have a basis in reality.

Here's some references to Jews admitting that their fellow Jews control [Hollywood](http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/19/opinion/oe-stein19), [the media](https://youtu.be/0dPAINP6L9I), [our political system](https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/218408), [American foreign policy](http://archive.is/3bWXQ), [the porn industry](http://www.jewishquarterly.org/issuearchive/articled325.html?articleid=38), and even [the comic book industry](http://www.jweekly.com/2005/10/21/cover-story-jews-and-the-invention-of-the-american-comic-book/). There's definitely better sources that support those claims, but those are the sources that immediately pop into my memory.\n\nI had always noticed that Jews are insanely overrepresented in the news media, the entertainment industry, the financial sector, academia, and in a wide variety of ideological movements, but I had always chalked it up to Jews having high IQs, Jewish nepotism, and a kind of unofficial, post-WWII affirmative action policy that was given to Jews in order to compensate them for the holocaust. It wasn't until I got into a debate with another White Nationalist about this topic about 3 years ago when I finally discovered the work of Kevin MacDonald. He suggested that I read [*The Culture of Critique*](https://youtu.be/V6bmYOlV-K8), and so I did. That book is one of those books that completely changes how you view the world. That book is what allowed me to put all of the puzzle pieces together so that I could finally understand what I was looking at when it came to Jews. I never looked at Jews the same way again after reading that book. I searched online for refutations of his work and was shocked to see that there really wasn't much substance to the critiques. The critiques mostly focused on condemning him for providing an intellectual justification for anti-Jewish racism rather than criticizing the veracity of his claims. It seems like Jews don't really have a convincing response to his work because he nailed them down so convincingly. So, you can't truly understand the Alt-Right's hostility and suspicion towards Jews until you read that book.\n\nThe TL;DR version of Kevin MacDonald's work is that Jews have basically conspired to undermine White Western civilization and liberate themselves from White oppression by advancing a wide range of cultural, political, and ideological movements - such as Freudian psychoanalysis, Boasian anthropology, Critical Theory, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 [[1]](https://youtu.be/bHh2N3vZBFc)[[2]](http://archive.is/GHnJc)[[3]](http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/immigration.pdf), communism [[1]](https://youtu.be/LAhHRdfh22k)[[2]](http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/slezkinerev.pdf), et cetera. And since he's an evolutionary psychologist, he interprets these efforts as Jews pursuing an evolutionary group strategy.  \n\nKevin MacDonald has also argued that Jews are basically suffering from a kind of collective racial PTSD because of the pogroms and the holocaust, and therefore they have an axe to grind against we White goyim and a pathological obsession with preventing the Fourth Reich from arising. A right-wing Jew named Lawrence Auster did a fantastic job of further elucidating this aspect of Jewish psychology in a [article](http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=12534) that he wrote back in 2004 for FrontPage Magazine, which is owned by a far-right Jew named David Horowitz. Auster explained that his fellow Jews basically view all Whites as potential Nazis. And because Jews are so obsessed with preventing another holocaust, they support mass non-White immigration into the White Western world (including Islamic immigration) in order to make the West Nazi-proof. He also explained that his fellow Jews have a zero tolerance policy towards any form of White pride or bigotry because they think that White pride or bigotry will inevitably result in another Auschwitz.\n\nAnd [here's](https://twitter.com/benjaminwittes/status/566971638009593856) a prominent Jewish leader named Benjamin Wittes,\u200f who's a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution, which is probably the most powerful think tank in the entire world, openly admitting in a tweet that 20th century America is a Jewish experiment and that America is even more important to Jews than Israel. Imagine if a prominent Indian-American leader (the South Asian variety) said that America was a 20th century Indian experiment and that America was more important to Indians than India. Such a statement would be strong evidence in support of the idea that Indian-Americans have been the hidden hand behind America's cultural, political, economic, and ideological development over the last several decades, right?\n\nAnd just this afternoon I was reading [this](http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/06/courtney-love-rips-linda-sarsour-vile-disgrace-women-anti-american-fraud/) blog post from the Gateway Pundit about Courtney Love and Linda Sarsour getting into a Twitter spat.

They view all White people as potential Nazis, they played a [central role](http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/Jews&amp;Blacks.pdf) in demonizing and combating White bigotry, and they routinely push the idea that all White people are incurably racist. So, if bigotry is the worst sin imaginable, and if all White people are incurably bigoted, then what's the solution? Obviously the only solution is a [Final Solution](https://youtu.be/q90kmUbEv7c) for we Whites. Therefore, allowing Jews to either directly control or heavily influence our media, our financial institutions, our academic institutions, and our government would be like [putting crypto-Nazis pretending to be progressives in charge of Israel](https://youtu.be/lKDeyuM0-Og).

There are plenty of reasons to disparage zionists as a group, and any other language you would use as a substitute for the word \"zionist\" could be used exactly the same why by people using it as a dogwhistle. If it is case that *any* generalizing about \"zionists\" or \"supporters of Israel\" or even \"friends of Israel\" - all of which are discrete political tendencies and not ethnicities, even if they are used as dogwhistles sometimes - would be unacceptable. \n\n&gt;99% of zionists I've met have been Jews\n\nDo you mean self-identified zionists? Because I mean people that support the existence of a Jewish homeland in the form of a Jewish state in Palestine. Even in the US, I don't think there are many self-identifying zionists who are not Jewish, outside of evangelical politics.\n\nThe point about the irony comments has become entirely muddled. First of all it has to be understood that Corbyn did not just say \"zionists don't understand irony.\" He said that zionists *in parliament* listened to a speech about the history and plight of Palestinians, and then berated the speaker afterwards for insensitivity to Jews. The point being that *those* zionists *in Parliament* are rightfully very concerned with people understanding the history of the holocaust and the plight and history of Jews in general, but do not understand the conflict between the principle behind that belief and their actions toward that speaker. This, he said, was them not understanding english irony. This alone makes it entirely clear to me that he was not dogwhistling in the slightest, but the point I was trying to make before was that a non-english person not understanding english irony would be perfectly expected and not noteworthy. It's because they *are* english that them not understanding english irony is ironic.\n\nThe mural is racist, it is not obviously racist.

(There's also the person holding the sign about the NWO but that was cropped out of the post on facebook that Corbyn commented on.)

You know how many hundreds of times they were expelled from kingdoms in the Middle Ages? If you don't accept that there may be a grain of truth to it then you must accept that there is a vast anti-Jewish conspiracy.\n\nAny non-Christian was treated with great hostility. It was the Middle Ages. Jews refused to convert and many rumors about them spread across Europe, from being the killers of Jesus to sacrificing Christian children. Jews were typically the only non-Christians in most European nations during this time and an easy scapegoat. Pagans and Muslims were treated just as harshly if they were present. They were also forced into roles of finance, as it was forbidden for Christians to do so. Kingdoms often forced Jews to select from a very limited few job options, however when they actually made money from these finance roles (not surprising) they were then viewed with suspicion and jealousy. When Jews were tolerated, they became incredibly successful and prosperous in any nation they were in. \n\n&gt; I really think you are missing the forest for the trees here though. 1-3% of the population holds a hugely disproportionate amount of influence in our politics, media, financial system and popular culture. The are of a religion and culture that is not at all representative of the white and black Christians that compromise the vast majority of the country.\n\nThen you jump back to conspiratorial. This is true, Jews are disproportionately represented in media, politics, finance, and higher education. They have also contributed to science, art, and literature at disproportionate rates. I find it impressive. Why do you think this is? Do they have a higher IQ than European whites? \n\n&gt;This is a problem. Would Israel tolerate that level of Christian influence in their society? Would Saudi Arabia tolerate that? Would Japan? Hell no they wouldn't.\n\nYou\u2019re once again perceiving Jews as completely foreign to the United States and Europe. Israel has only been a nation since shortly after the end of WW2. Jews were in Europe for two thousand years before the creation of Israel. Do you know any American Jews? (Assuming you\u2019re American) you probably don\u2019t. It\u2019s not like all they care about is Israel and they\u2019re Israeli foreign agents, far from it.

Women have more rights, they have a democratic European-style government system, treat gay people far better, and have an old and beautiful history and culture.

Also, Marx was a Jew, and it is heavily debated whether that pamphlet was antisemitic. Some arguments against: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Jewish_Question#Interpretations\n\n&gt;Jonathan Sacks, Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom, regards application of the term \"antisemitism\" to Marx as an anachronism because when Marx wrote \"On the Jewish Question\", virtually all major philosophers had expressed similar views, and the word \"antisemitism\" had not yet been coined, let alone developed a racial component, and little awareness existed of the depths of European prejudice against Jews. Marx thus simply expressed the commonplace thinking of his era, according to Sacks.\n\n&gt;The political-scientist Professor Iain Hamphsher-Monk wrote in his textbook: \"This work [\"On The Jewish Question\"] has been cited as evidence for Marx's supposed antisemitism, but only the most superficial reading of it could sustain such an interpretation.\"[12] Also, McLellan and Francis Wheen argue readers should interpret \"On the Jewish Question\" in the deeper context of Marx's debates with Bruno Bauer, author of The Jewish Question, about Jewish emancipation in Germany. Francis Wheen says: \"Those critics, who see this as a foretaste of 'Mein Kampf', overlook one, essential point: in spite of the clumsy phraseology and crude stereotyping, the essay was actually written as a defense of the Jews. It was a retort to Bruno Bauer, who had argued that Jews should not be granted full civic rights and freedoms unless they were baptised as Christians\". Although he claimed to be an atheist, Bruno Bauer viewed Judaism as an inferior civilization.[35]\n\n\n&gt;For sociologist Robert Fine (2006)[33] Bauer's essay \"echoed the generally prejudicial representation of the Jew as 'merchant' and 'moneyman'\", whereas \"Marx's aim was to defend the right of Jews to full civil and political emancipation (that is, to equal civil and political rights) alongside all other German citizens\". Fine argues that \"[the] line of attack Marx adopts is not to contrast Bauer's crude stereotype of the Jews to the actual situation of Jews in Germany\", but \"to reveal that Bauer has no inkling of the nature of modern democracy\".\n\n\n\n\n&gt;David McLellan, however, has argued that \"On the Jewish Question\" must be understood in terms of Marx's debates with Bruno Bauer over the nature of political emancipation in Germany. According to McLellan, Marx used the word \"Judentum\" in its colloquial sense of \"commerce\" to argue that Germans suffer, and must be emancipated from, capitalism. The second half of Marx's essay, McLellan concludes, should be read as \"an extended pun at Bauer's expense\".[10]\n\n\n\nMoreover, if you want to talk about controversial comments by Jews, I think what is more relevant than that today is Netanyahu distorting history of the Holocaust to say Hitler did not want to kill the Jews but the Palestinians convinced him to:\n\nhttps://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-absolves-hitler-of-guilt-1.5411578\n\n&gt;Prime minister tells World Zionist Congress that Hitler only wanted to expel the Jews, but Jerusalem's Grand Mufti convinced him to exterminate them, a claim that was rejected by most accepted Holocaust scholars.\n\nand just yesterday on Twitter saying this: \n\n&gt;The weak crumble, are slaughtered and are erased from history while the strong, for good or for ill, survive.

If I may I'd like to recommend two books which really opened my eyes about it and I think you should take the time to read them. \n\nMost people will recommend you read Culture of Critique which is basically \"The Jews: The Book\". It's probably very good and very detailed but I haven't actually read it yet. What I would recommend instead are two relatively shortish books the first of which is called Germany and the Jewish Problem by F. K. Wiebe. Wiebe details the ways in which a very small minority of Jews took control of key industries and the corruption and crime they had a hand in prior to Hitler's rise to power. You will notice the parallels to our own United States in the current time, from control of Newspapers and other media to promoting homosexuality and degeneracy in major cities. The second book is Debating The Holocaust: A New Look At Both Sides by Thomas Dalton. Dalton examines the Holocaust and looks at claims made by mainstream Holocaust experts as well as those who've spoken against key elements of the historical events. I went into this expecting the author to be biased towards the official Holocaust story but IMHO he gave it a fair shake.\n\nNow I just want to say whether you read these or not (I really hope you do) I want to make it clear that of course not every Jew is guilty of being some evil globalist power.

These theories begin with the assumption that the Rothschilds or Globalistsread:jews are some sort of malicious other, alien to normal people.

Such a statement would be strong evidence in support of the idea that Tutsis have been the hidden hand behind Rwanda's cultural, political, economic, and ideological development over the last several decades, right?\n\nFurther into detail on this is something I'll quote from the generally insane \"black agenda report\" group, [an interesting observation they made about Rwanda](https://www.blackagendareport.com/wikileaks-rwandan-reconciliation-lie)\n\n&gt;This is one of the many thousands of diplomatic cables that Wikileaks released between February 18, 2010, and September 1, 2011. \n\n&gt;The cable\u2019s title is \u201cETHNICITY IN RWANDA - - -WHO GOVERNS THE COUNTRY?\u201d It\u2019s dated August 5, 2008.

It therefore could have been written and sent by any one of many US officials: the US Ambassador to Rwanda, a member of his staff, and/or any number of CIA, DIA, or other spooks in the region. It identifies the recipient simply as the US State Department.\n\n&gt;The cable describes a country exclusively ruled by a Tutsi elite headed by Rwandan President Paul Kagame. Tutsi refugees and expatriates have told me for many years that Rwanda is headed by a Tutsi elite, but this description by a US official is far more extreme than anything they had ever led me to imagine. I knew that there were token Hutus holding official positions, but I assumed that they had the power of their office. This cable reports instead:\n\n&gt;1. An analysis of the ethnic breakdown of the current Rwandan government shows Tutsis hold a preponderant percentage of senior positions. Hutus invery senior positions often hold relatively little real authority, and are commonly \"twinned\" with senior Tutsis who exercise real power. The military and security agencies are controlled by Tutsis, generally English speakers who grew up as refugees with President Kagame in Uganda. The 28-member cabinet is evenly split among Tutsis and Hutus, but most key ministries are in the hands of Tutsis (Hutu ministers do head Health and Agriculture, ministries which affect the lives of most Rwandans). While the Rwandan government (GOR) presents itself as a champion of national unity and equal opportunity, de-emphasizing ethnic identity and ostensibly opening positions throughout society to those of skill and merit, political authority in the country does not yet reflect this ideal. Ethnic identity is still keenly felt and lived, and ordinary Rwandans are well aware of who holds the levers of power. The long-term stability of Rwanda depends upon a government and ruling party that eventually shares real authority with the majority population.\n\n&gt;End summary.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cThe military and security agencies are controlled by Tutsis, generally English speakers who grew up as refugees with President Kagame in Uganda.\u201d\n\n&gt;...\u201cRwandans are well aware of who holds the levers of power.\u201d\n\n&gt;It Starts at the Top: Powerful Tutsis, Secondary Hutus\n\n&gt;3.

Close Kagame confidant, Chief of Defense Staff General James Kabarebe, is Tutsi, as are the chiefs of the army and air force, the military district commanders, and the heads of the Rwanda National Police and the National Security Service (although some Rwandans joke that short-statured Air Force Chief Muhire is Twa). Indeed, all are English speakers who grew up in Uganda. Some major positions are held by Hutus, but their actual authority often appears limited, and they are widely perceived to be \"twinned\" with more powerful Tutsi colleagues.\n\n", "score": 4, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "conspiracyundone", "date_year_month": "2018-09", "created_utc_converted": "2018-09-03 05:06:44", "score_overall": 13, "words": "conspiracy jewish jewish globalist conspiracy jewish jew jewish jewish jewish jew jewish jewish", "shared_words": "conspiracy jewish globalist jew", "socre_distint": 4}

People who have dabbled in the arts and gone too far.\n\n*rubs hands together*\n\n&gt;Paranoitic. The real ones, to be treated. The paranoia is there before any conspiracy theory. When you are younger, you see dark shadows in places. You know everyone is laughing at you. You know something is not right. And then you find conspiracy theories and you finally know what is not right. And it fits. No one else believes, just you. You and your small circle of confidants. Who make it worse. So if you now smell something funny? It's the CIA. If now someone follows you? It's the KGB. If now the lights flicker in the room? Mossad.\n\nParanoid Schizophrenia is a real mental disorder, and anyone who has it will have conspiratorial machinations well before being exposed to the conspiracy community. Equivocating the two is irrational. Now, if you mean to say that there are paranoid people in the conspiracy theory, I'd agree. Some rationally so, some irrationally so. Some may have had paranoid predispositions, others not. If you feel the government or some criminal, violent entity is after you, and you don't have any sway or power, you're irrationally paranoid. Joe Rogan once said, \"if you aren't paranoid...\" (or at least cynical, IMO) \"you're not paying attention\". That doesn't mean you should go off the deep end, you don't have to take yourself and everything so seriously all the time.\n\n&gt;Religious zealots. It has all the aspects of religion when you think about it. I'm dissatisfied with the world. It's fucked. Why is it fucked? Well, I read this bible webpage and here, there is a conspiracy. But what can I do? Oh, I have to do nothing. Because the rapture something will happen that will blow it all out of water! The Great Awakening! The exposition! And they will all get what's coming to them and it will all be alright then. Whoever is against that is just an Satanist unbeliever shill and fuck him. I'm absolutely impotent and powerless against the huge chaos of the world, but it will get corrected and then everything will be fine. So I'll just sit here, smug, cause being smug is my only line of defense against the world.\n\nThis is a defense against fear, making use of blind faith in the improvement of the conditions of being. This is not endemic to conspiracy theory, it's endemic to the human condition, and conspiracy theorists are also humans. Hopeless, desperate humans, with little locus of control-most people in the world are. Their religion is not the conspiracy theory. Their religion is hope, and they attach it to their worldview, which in this case happens to involve conspiracy theories. You're describing most people on earth. You can see this kind of person in every society in the world. \n\n&gt;Self-worth. I've amounted to nothing, I'm worth nothing to no one. Why? Jews. But I got something you don't know. I've got the feeling that I've got it all figured out. My failure is my hobby, my mistakes are my projects. I inspect them and find the faults of others everywhere. If I'm so smart, why ain't I rich? Jews. Come, I'll show you the graphs.\n\nAgain this is not endemic to the conspiracy community. Racial based, class based, intelligence based, economic based, and even ethical based posturing and ranking along social hierarchy, internally and externally, is a feature of every society on earth, every individual on earth. In this case, it has been attached to Jews specifically. There's a reason for that by the way-it's a reactionary, defensive response to assault. In the case of Jews, it is a cultural and political policy assault. I don't believe, \"it's the jews\" as some put it, but there are some very interesting polls on public opinion of different demographics along ethnic, religious, political, racial, and gender criteria, that reveal what Jews think about non-jew whites, and evangelical christians in particular. What's more, the Israeli lobby in the U.S. is profoundly influential. Since your example was so specific to an existing conspiracy theory, I felt the need to refute a particular assertion. If you can't see how tribalistic Jewish culture is, you're not paying attention. You can explain why this is with The Holocaust, but you can't justify it. Many historically oppressed groups are also tribalistic, but few are to the extent of the Jewish culture, and few are as powerful and influential. This goes unquestioned, widely accepted in the west, when it shouldn't be, because it is a primitive, backwards way of thinking. \n\nCoincidentally, many Jews in America are very liberal, and support identity politics, feminism, and intersectionality, which are the most dominant forms of tribalism in our society, which also just so happen to specifically target non-jew whites, as the punching bag for the anger and angst of historically oppressed groups subject to cultural artifacts of feelings of inadequacy and low self worth, well articulated in your statement above. **I've amounted to nothing, I'm worth nothing to no one. Why? White people. But I've got something you don't know. I've got the feeling that I've got it all figured out (progressivism, marxism, SJW virtue signalling, identity politics, whatever it may be).

As I'm rewatching the video to refresh my memory the first time Jews are mentioned is at 10:45 which is roughly a third of the way into the video. Anyway these caveats always have to be made otherwise someone always trots out their friends cousins ex girlfriends teachers sisters husband who is a Jew and not in the porn industry or whatever the topic is at the time. Yes we know Not All, it's literally a meme at this point. The point that he is trying to make is that out of people who are significant or important to the porn industry a, as you quoted, disproportionate amount are Jews. What does it mean to be a disproportionate amount but not a majority? Well let's say we live in a town and in that town there are plenty of jobs. Baker, mailman, police officer, teacher, car mechanic, etc. In this town there are exactly 5 black men. You would expect them to all have different jobs. But what if 4 of them were firemen? In this town there are 10 firemen total but statistically a disproportionate amount of firemen are black. NOT a majority, but a disproportionate amount compared to their population size and the jobs available to them. That is what is being said here. There aren't that many Jews but they seem to gravitate towards certain industries and Pornography is one of them.\n\n&gt;Then he's got a quote from a guy talking about subverting uptight Christian norms - well he's not alone in this, lots of whiteys were also into defying the uptight trads and religious types; him and that article about the Silverman movie slap their own Jewish identity onto their \"transgressiveness\" but it's indistinguishable from what rebellious whites do.\n\nFrankly I think this is a case of \"it's ok when we do it\". If whites are subverting their own well that's fine and we will deal with that but we don't need Jews or any other people trying to subvert our ways either do we? Also I'd like to just make a side note here that in most cases when whites are rebellious and subversive towards their own it's usually due to outside influence.\n\n&gt;Obviously to this guy, dismantling tradcon values, is indistinguishable from \"attacking the west\", and he can't see how that can easily be motivated by those values being perceived as boring and stifling without any intent of thereby causing a decline of birthrates, or even awareness of that being a measurable consequence.\n\nWell the thing is they don't need to be doing it with intent. For this guy, as you noted the Tradcon values are stifling so he wants to dismantle them. In doing so he participated in essentially hurting the birth rate and white society. Doesn't matter if that was his intention or not.\n\n&gt;Even one of his own excerpts emphasizes how some of the early performers saw themselves as championing \"secular humanism\" against puritanical religiosity, probably completely oblivious to the difference between secular humanism and wanting to destroy the white west.\n\nI think you might be missing the point. It's not a matter of wanting to destroy whites or western values or whatever, it's just a matter of it happening. There doesn't need to be some conspiracy to destroy whitey. If there is one, well ok that would be a smoking gun, but it's not necessary for one to oppose Jewish influence.\n\n&gt;Then some JewSup comment by James Deen, which very well might've been a joke - and even if not, it would seem like a meritocratic statement of fact similar to what WhiteSups say about themselves. Nothing about \"subverting\" anything. Some quote about Jew men liking to bone white women, well so they're into white women, white women like mediterranean men and white men like spicy women etc., it was just a lighthearted statement about preferences and nothing to do with any political agenda.\n\nSounds like you're doing all you can to handwave and downplay what is being said.\n\n&gt;He jumps on the typical circlejerk bandwagon among trad as well as feminist anti-porners when he claims that all (or most of it, but don't dwell on that phrase eh?) porn is about \"degradation\", which is complete horse shite, and that since most female performers are white then that makes it about the degradation of whites - completely ignoring the large presence and popularity of latinas, southern euros, asians etc. that also get degraded, or don't get degraded, depending on the genre; their male partners vary in race as well, lots if not most of them are white.\n\nIf you look at the most popular porn a lot of it is very \"hardcore\" and degrading. The whole situation is degrading. You are being paid to have sex. You're turning the woman into a prostitute. Her only worth is her body. Those are the messages being sent through porn. They are implicit. You don't need a woman standing in front of a camera telling you she's worthless, although some porn films probably have that as well.\n\n&gt;And then at the end he brings up Israel introducing the default porn ban, not even dealing with the question of whether those are \"the same\" Jews that were being transgressive in the West or completely different, conservative ones - while also glossing over what's undoubtedly on everyone's mind when watching that section, namely Britain's various pornhibitions incl. an upcoming (or already passed) default restriction JUST LIKE ISRAEL'S. Gee could it be that there's conservatives that want to protect children both in a white country and a jewish country? So yeah, that was incredibly weak - that's not the best most solid argument for pr0n being a jewish plot to subvert the west... right?\n\nJews are Jews. Many Jews hold dual citizenship and have access to Israel via the Right of Return if they choose to use it. If you look at how most Jews tend to live their personal lives even in the United States they tend to be very conservative and even outright racist. For example they don't want their daughters marrying blacks. And yet they will turn right around and promote interracial relationships in porn, movies, music, TV ads, video games, etc. It's astonishing really. So yes they are the same Jews.\n\n&gt;Conversely, what are all those ((()))s supposedly doing in their media control, education and academic control, etc. etc. if not convincing the filthy goyim via arguments and discourse?\n\nDo you think a Jewish Marxist professor is going to fairly depict both sides of a topic? Would they even discuss that there IS another side? That's not argument and discourse, it's not education. How about this go to a Gender Studies class in any university and tell the teacher there that women and men are not equal. See if she (god forbid it's a he) tries to have a discussion and a rational discourse with you. You and I both know she'll screech at you to exit the classroom to the applause of her sheep.\n\n&gt;Well you can, although better evidence for them being really behind it, than that vide\u00f3, would also be a good idea ;)\n\n\nIt's been awhile, forgot what this was referring to.\n\n&gt;That's two completely different things though, planting desires into goyim's heads and convincing them it's their own, vs. weakening restraint against already existent desires.\n\nI don't see how those have to be mutually exclusive.\n\n&gt;Don't see how it's uncommon.\n\nIIRC less than 10% of couples are interracial. \n\n&gt;It's definitely a preference but the question is how overwhelming of a preference.\n\nPretty overwhelming.", "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "DebateAltRight", "date_year_month": "2018-09", "created_utc_converted": "2018-09-11 13:35:58", "score_overall": 10, "words": "jew jewish conspiracy jewish jew jewish jewish goyim jewish goyim", "shared_words": "jew jewish conspiracy goyim", "socre_distint": 4}

And such denial is, in fact, antisemitic. It is an attempt to rip away a huge amount of Jewish identity from without and to minimize what it means to be a Jew.\n\nZionism is entirely based on the fact that Jews are returning to their homeland from which they never severed their emotional, religious or even physical ties.\n\nIsrael was always considered home for Jews. Way before Zionism, Jews have made the trip to the Land. The yearning for Zion and Jerusalem has been a fixed part of Judaism and has been part of the daily prayers ever since the destruction of the second Temple.\n\n&gt; Conflating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism just gives Zionists a convenient way to shut down any argument against them. \n\nOver the past few months, leaders of the left in both the US and Britain have been implicated by associating with and/or failing to condemn anti-Semitism. To no one's surprise, some of those same leaders are some of the most strongly pro-Palestine voices in their respective parties. Let's begin with the United States.\n \nLouis Farrakhan is an unapologetic anti-Semite and has been for decades. His anti-Semitism is unambiguous, he literally says in English that Jews (not \"Zionists\" or any other euphemism) are Satanic, are evil, are his enemy, etc. etc. His views are 100% aligned with David Duke on this subject. So why is he suddenly gaining attention now? [Because two of the leaders of the Women's March, a strong and powerful movement within the American Left, went to one of his speeches and sat attentively listening to him.](https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/3/7/17082030/womens-march-louis-farrakhan-tamika-mallory-anti-semitism-controversy) Farrakhan was just at Aretha Franklin's funeral and Bill Clinton did not condemn him or insist on not standing near him. The Women's March included within the statements of some of its speakers anti-Israel and pro-Palestine messages such as [\"Zionism has no place in the womens movement\"]( https://azjewishpost.com/2018/at-2018-womens-march-anti-israel-rhetoric-destroys-sense-of-unity/). When the Women's March was asked about two of its leadership attended Farrakhan's speech, it issued a statement that they oppose all forms of bigotry including anti-Semitism and [\"Minister Farrakhan's statements about Jewish, queer, and trans people are not aligned with the Women's March Unity principles.\"]( https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/3/7/17082030/womens-march-louis-farrakhan-tamika-mallory-anti-semitism-controversy) But the actual leaders who attended the speech have failed to make statements of any kind about Farrakhan. [I guess they're too busy getting their pictures taken with him.](https://instagram.com/p/33B47Axqr7/?utm_source=ig_embed) and [praising him on social media.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/womens-march-leader-defends-relationship-with-farrakhan/) Meanwhile, Linda Sarsour, the virulently anti-Israel, \"pro-Palestinian,\" and anti-Zionist activist who said once that people can't be both Zionists and feminists, has been revealed to have praised Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam in the past, [writing \"God bless him\" on an Instagram photo of him.](http://www.israellycool.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sarsour-3.jpg) When asked to condemn Farrakhan directly, Sarsour replied instead that she [\"stands up for all communities every day including with Jews against anti-Semitism\"]( http://www.israellycool.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sarsour-stand-up.jpg) which is not the same thing. Remember, Farrakhan has been making anti-Jewish statements for literally decades. Sarsour, Mallory and the other leaders of the Women's March must have known that, but they praised Farrakhan and attended his speeches anyway. Imagine for a second Donald Trump attended a David Duke speech, sat, and listened to the entire thing. Would anyone doubt that Donald Trump is a racist? Even if he said David Duke's message isn't aligned with his own principles and that he's not a racist? Please.\n \nLet's head over to the other side of the pond where Britain's primary leftist party, Labour, is being rocked by a scandal. A report complete with screenshots illustrates that [numerous Labour MPs, including Jeremy Corbyn were part of a secret Facebook group called Palestine Live]( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/08/labour-suspends-party-members-in-antisemitic-facebook-group) for years. Why is that a problem? Well, the Facebook group in addition to the standard anti-Israel schlock contained dozens of postings of blatant Holocaust denial including many from neo-Nazi/white supremacist websites, conspiracy theories blaming Israel/Zionists/Jews/Rothschilds for 9/11 and 7/7, and other anti-Semitic content. Corbyn and some other MPs were active in the group, \"liking\" and commenting on anti-Israel articles posted by many of the same people posting the anti-Semitic content. [I invite you to read the whole report and learn more.](http://david-collier.com/exclusive-corbyn-antisemitism/) Numerous MPs, but not Corbyn, have been suspended while this is investigated further. Corbyn has supported Terror groups that want to all Jews to perish. \n \nSo what's the point of this news and why are we talking about it here? The point is that anti-Semitism is not worlds away from anti-Zionism and anti-Israel/pro-Palestinian activity and that many individuals including those who claim to be human rights activists and liberals can be both. We now see two examples of some of the most prominent anti-Israel critics and \"Palestinian supporters\" in the US and UK rubbing shoulders with unapologetic anti-Semites. As high profile anti-Israel critics, Corbyn and Sarsour should have been holding themselves to the highest possible standard in regards to not associating with anti-Semites. Instead, they appeared to have gone out of their way to meet up with some. How should individual progressives respond to this association by the higher ups in their party? And if these people continue to remain in the movement, what does that say about the left's movement in general? \n\n&gt; apartheid\n\nUnder SA apartheid or \"Jim Crow\" laws: there were separate facilities for whites and blacks: separate public washrooms, separate parks, separate drinking fountains, separate restaurants, etc.\n\nAll these do not exist in Israel.\n\nUnder SA apartheid or \"Jim Crow\": blacks had no voice in government or in the courts; they couldn't be part of mainstream society in politics, professions, the army or police.\n\nIn Israel: Arabs vote, work in any profession anywhere, including the army or the police, as lawyers and judges; non-Jewish judges were in the courts that sent a former president of Israel and a former prime minister to prison in Israel!

So has anti-Semitism under Orban got worse or better?\n\nRelated Articles\n\nHungary\u2019s Jews Trapped Between pro-Israel and anti-Semitic Politics\n\nThe Corbyn Left Turns Conspiracist on Jews and Syria\n\nI constantly find myself asking the same question about Britain, the country of my birth. These things weren\u2019t measured when I was a kid there in the late 1970s and early 80s, but I remember a great deal of anti-Semitic graffiti and vandalism, even in the Jewish neighborhood where we lived, and across the country there was more violence from the fascist hard-right, and anti-Semitic chants were the norm at football matches. It hasn\u2019t disappeared - but it\u2019s no where near as bad nowadays.\n\nBut in the last three years, since Jeremy Corbyn was elected the leader of the Labour Party, barely a week goes by without another anti-Semitic scandal at the heart of Britain\u2019s largest (in terms of numbers of paid-up members) political party.\n\nThere have been two kinds of scandals. Either it has been party members, of all levels, coming out with the most\u00a0odious statements\u00a0about Jews, sometimes only barely veiled by using the words \"Zionists,\" \"bankers\" and \"the lobby.\" There was one thing all those members had in common - they were all diehard supporters of Corbyn.\n\nThe other kind of incident were the periodic revelations of Corbyn\u2019s own participation in events with\u00a0Jew-haters\u00a0and Holocaust-revisionists, his support of them (sometimes tempered with his excuse that \"I knew they did good work, I wasn\u2019t aware of other things they said,\") and his\u00a0membership\u00a0of real-life and online groups where anti-Semitic statements were routinely aired.\n\nI\u2019ve never quite been able to work out whether Corbyn is an anti-Semite himself. But this week, Margaret Hodge, a veteran Labour parliamentarian and party member of fifty years\u2019 standing called him \"a fucking anti-Semite and racist\" to his face. The normally mild-mannered Hodge has known Corbyn as a colleague throughout his political career, so I think we should maybe take her word for it.\n\nThe reason for Hodge\u2019s outburst was the decision by Labour\u2019s National Executive Council, dominated by Corbyn and his supporters, to reject the International Holocaust Remembrance Authority\u2019s (IHRA)\u00a0official definition\u00a0of anti-Semitism and adopt instead guidelines\u00a0favored by the hard-left\u00a0of the party.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m not a huge fan of defining anti-Semitism. I think I know what it is when I see it. You can go online and read elsewhere about the various merits and flaws of the IHRA definition.\n\n\ufffcVans with slogans aimed at Britain's Labour Party are driven around Parliament Square ahead of a debate on antisemitism in Parliament, in London, April 17, 2018.\u00a0\\ HANNAH MCKAY/ REUTERS\n\nBut what you need to know right now is that the IHRA definition has been adopted by successive British governments, and more important, the British legal system and the overwhelming majority of British Jewish organizations and communities.\n\nThis week, an\u00a0unprecedented list\u00a0of 68 prominent British rabbis, spanning the range from female progressives to Hasidic ultra-Orthodox, signed a letter beseeching Labour to adopt the IHRA definition. But Corbyn\u2019s team refused.\n\nSo the British Labour Party now officially allows within its ranks anti-Semites who could be prosecuted by the authorities. And it is now the second major political party in Europe, along with Orban\u2019s Fidesz, to reject the definition of anti-Semitism as understood by the very people it is directed against, the\u00a0local Jewish community.\n\nI\u2019m really not sure how best to define anti-Semitism. It\u2019s the most ancient hatred which has proved extremely adept in evolving to life in the feverish conspiracy theory marshes of the internet. It\u2019s the template for all hatred towards minorities but also unique in the way it sees Jews as both inferior and all-powerful.\n\nAnti-Semitism is both the socialism of fools and the most evil form of nationalism. Which is why those on the\u00a0both the far-left and far-right\u00a0are particularly susceptible to it. And it can masquerade equally as being, \"Just criticism of Israel\" and as, \"How can you call me an anti-Semite, I love Israel?\"\n\nSupporters of Orban, including some Jews like Netanyahu,\u00a0strenuously deny he is anti-Semite. They point to his support for Israel (not exactly Israel, more like Netanyahu\u2019s policies) and insist that Soros, while being Jewish, is a malicious influence on global politics and that there is nothing anti-Semitic about the campaign against him.\n\nSimilarly, Corbyn has his Jewish supporters, who are convinced that a man who claims to have fought racism all his life (racism for Corbyn has usually consisted of the policies of western and western-supported governments; he\u2019s blind to racism in regimes with which he\u2019s\u00a0more sympathetic), can not be considered an anti-Semite.\n\nAs a journalist and freedom-of-speech fanatic, I don\u2019t want anyone else defining for me what is or isn\u2019t anti-Semitism. But political leaders and parties need to be held to definitions and the one rule they have to abide by is anti-Semitism-is-whatever-most-of-its-potential-targets-and-victims-say-it-is. Orban and Corbyn refuse to do so.\n\n\ufffcEgyutt (Together) opposition party activist removes a government billboard displaying George Soros and his 'plan' to settle a million migrants in Europe per year. Budapest, Hungary, October 5, 2017\\ Bernadett Szabo/ REUTERS\n\nWho is worse? Orban or Corbyn? I don\u2019t know what either of them actually feel in their heart and mind towards Jews, but both are certainly enablers of anti-Semitism.\n\nFrom all available evidence, Corbyn is a stupid anti-Semite. Blinkered by his outdated dogma from perceiving it among his allies, and within the hateful environment in which he has been\u00a0immersed his entire adult life. He has convinced himself it is all legitimate anti-capitalism, anti-Zionism and\u00a0anti-imperialism.\n\nOrban, on the other hand, is a clever anti-Semite. He has a keen understanding of European history and politics, and knows exactly which buttons to push, how far to go and how to cover himself.\n\nWho is worse? The devious or the deluded? History proves that both sorts of anti-Semite can cause terrible damage.\n\nOnly one thing I can say for certain about anti-Semitism is that the best antidote to it is liberal democracy, moderate politics, and - for all the derision it now attracts from young firebrands and aging ideologues alike - centrism.\n\nOrban\u2019s nationalist government has engendered hatred towards Muslims and migrants. The diehard supporters of Corbyn\u2019s radical socialism are now focusing their hatred on Jews, but two years ago, when a lesbian parliamentarian led the challenge to his leadership, there was an outbreak of misogyny and homophobia.\n\nHatred, both overt and latent, not just of Jews, but of all minorities, of women and members of the LGBT community is always more prevalent on both the far-left and far-right fringes of politics. That is where hate and anger rule.\n\n", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "badunitedkingdom", "date_year_month": "2018-09", "created_utc_converted": "2018-09-12 21:28:59", "score_overall": 10, "words": "holocaust jewish jew holocaust holocaust jewish jewish conspiracy jewish jewish", "shared_words": "holocaust jewish jew conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

Francis, U.S. ambassador to Russia, reported in 1918,\n\n&gt;    The Bolshevik leaders here, most of whom are Jews and 90 percent of whom are returned exiles, care little for Russia or any other country but are internationalists and they are trying to start a worldwide social revolution.\n\nEven The Jewish Encyclopedia and the Universal Jewish Encyclopedia openly boast about the pivotal role of Jews in the Russian Revolution.\n\n&gt;    The Communist movement and ideology played an important part in Jewish life, particularly in the 1920s, 1930s and during and after World War II\u2026.  Individual Jews played an important role in the early stages of Bolshevism and the Soviet Regime\u2026.  The great attraction of Communism among Russian, and later also, Western Jewry, emerged only with the establishment of the Soviet Regime in Russia\u2026\n\n&gt;    Many Jews the world over therefore regarded the Soviet concept of the solution to the \u201cJewish question\u201d as an intrinsically positive approach\u2026.  Communism became widespread in virtually all Jewish communities.  In some countries Jews became the leading element in the legal and illegal Communist parties and in some cases were even instructed by the Communist International to change their Jewish-sounding names and pose as non-Jews, in order not to confirm right wing propaganda that presented Communism as an alien, Jewish conspiracy.\n\nIndeed, Communist and Bolshevik leaders and financiers were Jewish.\n\n\n*    Karl Marx, a descendant of a long line of rabbis, laid down the foundations for the most destructive and murderous ideology of all time, Communism.\n*   85% of the Bolshevik commissars were Jewish.\n*   Lenin was Jewish, spoke Yiddish at home, and was married to a Jewess.\n*    Trotsky\u2019s real Jewish name was \u201cLev Bronstein.\u201d  Trotsky played chess with Baron Rothschild of the famous Rothschild banking family.\n*   Jew Jacob Schiff financed Jewish-Communist revolutionaries in Russia with today\u2019s equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\nAnd, indeed, as Jews hate Christians\u2014even \u201catheistical\u201d Jews hate Christians\u2014the Jewish Bolshevik Revolution in Russia produced a secret police which imprisoned, tortured, or murdered more than thirty million Russians and Eastern Europeans.  Nobel Prizewinner Alexander Solzhenitsyn affirms that Jews created and administered the organized Soviet concentration camp system in which tens of millions of Christians died.\n\n**And yet the entire Western world must ignore this Jewish-led slaughter of their fellow men, and must weep only for the six million Jews who died in their holocaust.**\n\nIsraeli historian Louis Rapoport admitted of Jews\u2019 murderous reign in Russia,\n\n&gt;    Under Lenin, Jews became involved in all aspects of the Revolution, including its dirtiest work.  Despite the Communists\u2019 vows to eradicate Anti-Semitism, it spread rapidly after the revolution \u2014 partly because of the prominence of so many Jews in the Soviet administration, as well as in the traumatic, inhuman Sovietization drives that followed.  Historian Salo Baron has noted that an immensely disproportionate number of Jews joined the new Soviet secret police, the Checka\u2026.  And many of those who fell afoul of the Cheka would be shot by Jewish investigators.\n\nThe fate of 20th century Russia serves as a harrowing reminder of the final result of Jewish revolutionary movements in a Christian nation.  Considering that Jews control American finance, media, and politics, we can look at our world and see the same fate nearing.\n\nWith Jews entrenched in nearly all positions of power in the West, and with our people increasingly incited against each other, realize that the stage is nearly set for another Bolshevik-style revolution.

He was the only non-clerical professor at an institution run by Jesuits, whose order had been dissolved in 1773. The Jesuits of Ingolstadt, however, still retained the purse strings and some power at the University, which they continued to regard as their own. Constant attempts were made to frustrate and discredit non-clerical staff, especially when course material contained anything they regarded as liberal or Protestant.

From the days of **Spartacus-Weishaupt** to those of Karl Marx, and down to Trotsky (Russia), Bela Kun (Hungary), Rosa Luxembourg (Germany), and Emma Goldman (United States), this world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality, has been steadily growing. It played, as a modern writer, Mrs. Webster, has so ably shown, a definitely recognisable part in the tragedy of the French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the Nineteenth Century; and now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their heads and have become practically the undisputed masters of that enormous empire.\"\n\nSpartacus-Weishaupt is a reference to Illuminati founder Johann Adam Weishaupt who led the secular anti-Jesuit agenda\n\n&gt;You probably wonder why then, are we told that the Rothschilds are the ones who control all banks? well, that's because the jesuits were the ones who created the anti-semitic myths in the first place. Well, at least the ones related to an international Jewish conspiracy.\n\nYea yea, and Lenin claimed that the Tsar created antisemitism to scapegoat the Jews for problems that capitalists made\n\n\nThe early USSR had what I consider to be [racist, Russophobic policies targetting ethnic Russians for attack and displacement](http://www.unz.com/akarlin/lenin/)\n\nI believe that's why he insisted on renaming Russia to become the \"Soviet Union\" (much like Constantinople was renamed Istanbull)\n\nAnd I believe that was the driving motivation behind Bolshevik genocides [like that first in Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_famine_of_1921%E2%80%9322&amp;oldid=662607297)\n\n&gt;The Russian famine of 1921, also known as Povolzhye famine, was a severe famine in Bolshevik Russia which began in early spring of 1921 and lasted through 1922. This famine killed an estimated 6 million, primarily affecting the Volga and Ural River regions.\n\nThese 6 million weren't \"oppressed minorities\" though so we can just forget them (and the other countless millions of genocide victims)\n\n&gt;**In Lenins's secret letter to the Politburo, Lenin explains that the famine provides an opportunity against the church.** The Harvard historian Richard Pipes argued that the famine was used politically as an excuse for the Bolshevik leadership to persecute the Orthodox Church, which held significant sway over much of the peasant populace. **Pipes also considers the possibility that Lenin actually welcomed the famine as it weakened the peasantry and prevented the peasants from resisting the Bolsheviks.**\n\nEconomic crashes, poverty and starvation = easier to rule over peasantry who can't resist the \"comissar class\". Economic crashes, poverty, starvation and death are USEFUL to the neo-comissar class of today. Anyone challenging those issues not in the same ideological group is a threat. \"Revolutionary\" hero leader Leon Trotsky wrote letters mocking starving peasants, telling them to \"get back to him when they are eating their children, [and we have proof that they did this](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4076244/Distressing-photos-1920s-Russian-famine-turned-hopeless-peasants-cannibals-five-million-people-starved-death.html)\n\n&gt;The communist cannibals: Shocking images reveal the depravation suffered by peasants forced to eat HUMANS during the 1920s Russian famine\n\nLenin identified with his Jewish heritage\n\nDmitri Volkogonov, Lenin: Life and Legacy, translated and edited by Harold Shukman (HarperCollinsPublishers, London, 1994):\n\n&gt;{p. 8} In her letter to Stalin, Anna wrote, 'It's probably no secret for you that the research on our grandfather shows that he came from a poor Jewish family ...\n\n&gt;{p. 9} ... she also asserted ... that Lenin's Jewish origins 'are further confirmation of the exceptional abilities of the Semitic tribe, [confirmation] always shared by Ilyich [Lenin] ... Ilyich always valued the Jews highly'.  ... Anna's claim explains, for instance, why Lenin frequently recommended giving foreigners, especially Jews, intellectually demanding tasks, and leaving the elementary work to the 'Russian fools'..\n\nNote the theme of \"dumb Russian subhumans\"\n\n&gt;{p.xxxvii} He {Lenin} went on: 'Hand out the work to Russian idiots: send the cuttings here, but not occasional issues (as these idiots have been doing until now).'\n{p. 112} He {Lenin} might have been thinking of Parvus when he said to Gorky: 'the clever Russian is almost always a Jew or has Jewish blood in him.'\n\nAnother work on Trotsky in *Trotsky AND THE JEWS* by Joseph Nedava:\n\n\n&gt;LEON TROTSKY, Lenin's copartner in the Bolshevik revolution of 1917, was one of the titans of our times. Despite Stalin's painstaking efforts to eradicate Trotsky's memory from the annals of Russian and international communism (his name is still anathema in the Soviet Union), his stature in world history remains unimpaired. Moreover, in recent years there has been a marked **revival of Trotskyism throughout the world, and its followers have been gaining ground in the ranks of the New Left.**\n\n&gt;\"Trotsky was a prolific writer, and much has also been written about his life and ideas by others, friend and foe. Yet one vital aspect, bearing upon his entire personality and career, which may greatly elucidate his revolutionary zeal, as well as his ultimate downfall, has only been touched upon, namely, the Jewish aspect.\"\n\n&gt;...\"We also find confirmation of this in an interview Trotsky granted to the socialist Jewish Daily Forward on his arrival in New York in January 1917. Trotsky expressed his regret over not knowing Yiddish fluently. \"He had even applied himself once to the study of Yiddish in order to be able to understand the Jewish revolutionary literature. At that time, too, he even had a greater desire to master Hebrew, but unfortunately he had no time for that. His knowledge of Hebrew and Yiddish is therefore far from deep. Nevertheless, he understands Yiddish well.\" 25 **A Jewish journalist who knew Trotsky from the period of his stay in Vienna (\"when he used to play chess with Baron Rothschild in Cafe Central and frequent Cafe Arkaden daily to read the press there\") is even firmer on the Yiddish issue: \"He [Trotsky] knew Yiddish, and if at a later date, in his autobiography, he pretends to know nothing about Jews and Judaism, then this is nothing but a plain lie.

During those years, and especially during the first outburst of enthusiasm, in both religious camps there was one undivided and sacred German Empire for whose preservation and future existence they all prayed to Heaven...\n\n&gt;In so far as its origin and tradition are based on German ideals, Protestantism of itself defends those ideals better. But it fails the moment it is called upon to defend national interests which do not belong to the sphere of its ideals and traditional development, or which, for some reason or other, may be rejected by that sphere.\n\n&gt;Therefore Protestantism will always take its part in promoting German ideals as far as concerns moral integrity or national education, when the German spiritual being or language or spiritual freedom are to be defended: because these represent the principles on which Protestantism itself is grounded.\n\nThat was his view, it was pretty neutral in the conflict\n\nInterestingly, he later noted that the more that his party questioned Jewish power, the more often shills/infiltrators would incite Catholic/Protestant fights as a distraction:\n\n&gt;\"Later on the National Socialist Movement presented the Jewish problem in a new light.

{"archived": false, "author": "daudder", "body": "Paywalled (part 1):\n\nAn earthquake is quietly rocking the Jewish world.\n\nIn the 18th century, Jews began playing a decisive role in the promotion of universalism, because universalism promised them redemption from their political subjection. Through universalism, Jews could, in principle, be free and equal to those who had dominated them. This is why, in the centuries that followed, Jews participated in disproportionate numbers in communist and socialist causes. This is also why Jews were model citizens of countries, such as France or the United States, with universalist constitutions.\n\nThe history of Jews as promoters of Enlightenment and universalist values, however, is drawing to a close. We are the stunned witnesses of new alliances between Israel, Orthodox factions of Judaism throughout the world, and the new global populism in which ethnocentrism and even racism hold an undeniable place.\n\nWhen Prime Minister Netanyahu chose to align himself politically with Donald Trump before and after the U.S. presidential election of 2016, some people could still give him the benefit of doubt. Admittedly, Trump was surrounded by people like Steve Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, who reeked of racism and anti-Semitism, but no one was sure of the direction the new presidency would take. Even if Trump refused to condemn the anti-Semitic elements of his electoral base or the Ku Klux Klan, which had enthusiastically backed him, and even if it took him a long time to dissociate himself from David Duke \u2013 we were not yet certain of the presence of anti-Semitism in Trump\u2019s discourse and strategies (especially since his daughter Ivanka was a convert to Judaism).\n\nBut the events in Charlottesville in August 2017 no longer allowed for doubt. The neo-Nazi demonstrators committed violent acts against peaceful counter-protesters, killing one woman by plowing through a crowd with a car (an act reminiscent in its technique of terrorist attacks in Europe). Trump reacted to the events by condemning both the neo-Nazis and white supremacists and their opponents. The world was shocked by his conflation of the two groups, but Jerusalem did not object. Once again, the indulgent (or cynical) observer could have interpreted this silence as the reluctant obeisance of a vassal toward his overlord (of all the countries in the world, Israel receives the most military aid from the United States). One was entitled to think that Israel had no choice but to collaborate, despite the American leader\u2019s outward signs of anti-Semitism.\n\nThis interpretation, however, is no longer tenable. Before and since Charlottesville, Netanyahu has courted other leaders who are either unbothered by anti-Semitism or straightforwardly sympathetic to it, and upon whom Israel is not economically dependent. His concessions go as far as participating in a partial form of Holocaust denial.\n\nTake the case of Hungary. Under the government of Viktor Orban, the country shows troubling signs of legitimizing anti-Semitism. In 2015, for example, the Hungarian government announced its intention to erect a statue to commemorate Balint Homan, a Holocaust-era minister who played a decisive role in the murder or deportation of nearly 600,000 Hungarian Jews. Far from being an isolated incident, just a few months later, in 2016, another statue was erected in tribute to Gyorgy Don\u00e1th, one of the architects of anti-Jewish legislation during World War II. It was thus unsurprising to hear Orban employing anti-Semitic tropes during his reelection campaign in 2017, especially against Georges Soros, the Jewish, Hungarian-American billionaire-philanthropist who supports liberal causes, including that of open borders and immigration. Reanimating the anti-Semitic clich\u00e9 about the power of Jews, Orban accused Soros of harboring intentions to undermine Hungary.\n\nWhom did Netanyahu choose to support? Not the anxious Hungarian Jewish community that protested bitterly against the anti-Semitic rhetoric of Orban\u2019s government; nor did he choose to support the liberal Jew Soros, who defends humanitarian causes. Instead, the prime minister created new fault lines, preferring political allies to members of the tribe. He backed Orban, the same person who resurrects the memory of dark anti-Semites. When the Israeli ambassador in Budapest protested the erection of the infamous statue, he was publicly contradicted by none other than Netanyahu.\n\nTo my knowledge, the Israeli government has never officially protested Orban\u2019s anti-Semitic inclinations and affinities. In fact, when the Israeli ambassador in Budapest did try to do so, he was quieted down by Jerusalem. Not long before the Hungarian election, Netanyahu went to the trouble of visiting Hungary, thus giving a \u201ckosher certificate\u201d to Orban and exonerating him of the opprobrium attached to anti-Semitism and to an endorsement of figures active in the Shoah. When Netanyahu visited Budapest, he was given a glacial reception by the Federation of the Jewish Communities, while Orban gave him a warm welcome. To further reinforce their touching friendship, Netanyahu invited Orban to pay a reciprocal visit to Israel this past July, receiving him in a way usually reserved for the most devoted national allies.\n\nThe relationship with Poland is just as puzzling. As a reminder, Poland is governed by the nationalist Law and Justice party, which has an uncompromising policy against refugees and appears to want to eliminate the independence of the courts by means of a series of reforms that would allow the government to control the judiciary branch. In 2016 the Law and Justice-led government eliminated the official body whose mission was to deal with problems of racial discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance, arguing that the organization had become \u201cuseless.\u201d\n\nEncouraged by this and other governmental declarations and policies, signs of nationalism multiplied within Polish society. In February 2018, president Andrzej Duda declared that he would sign a law making it illegal to accuse the Polish nation of having collaborated with the Nazis. Accusing Poland of collusion in the Holocaust and other Nazi atrocities would be from now prosecutable. Israel initially protested the proposed legislation, but then in June, Benjamin Netanyahu and the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, signed an agreement exonerating Poland of any and all crimes against the Jews during the time of the German occupation. Israel also acceded to Poland\u2019s move to outlaw the expression \u201cPolish concentration camp.\u201d Moreover, Netanyahu even signed a statement stipulating that anti-Semitism is identical to anti-Polonism, and that only a handful of sad Polish individuals were responsible for persecuting Jews \u2013 not the nation as a whole.\n\nIn July, that declaration was roundly condemned by Yad Vashem, as well as by a group of 21 Israeli historians, members of the Academy of Sciences and Humanities. But the stupefying result remained unchanged, with Netanyahu, the head of the Israeli government, giving his support to what amounts to a version of Holocaust denial. Netanyahu the history buff could not have been unaware that, in the words of Polish commentator Sawomir Sierakowski, \u201ctwo-thirds of the 250,000 Jews who escaped during the Nazis\u2019 \u2018liquidation\u2019 of Jewish ghettos in 1942 had been killed by 1945, most of them by Poles or with Polish participation.\u201d\n\nIf Israel still had a moral standing on one topic (sadly probably the only remaining one), it is with regard to the Shoah, but Netanyahu undermined it by making the history and memory of the Holocaust a politically negotiable and tradable commodity. And if that\u2019s not enough, earlier this month, Israel hosted Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte, a man who has proudly compared himself to Hitler.\n\nThis is a decisive turning point for Zionism, which places Netanyahu in an avant-garde of sorts, bringing the Revisionist Zionism he claims to represent to the final stage of its historical logic.\n\nAs a political doctrine and practice, traditional social-democratic Zionism had sought to find and maintain an equilibrium between three poles: Jewish communities in the Diaspora, Israel\u2019s security interests, and international political alliances with the world\u2019s strong democracies (cooperation with rogue states was for the most part unofficial). The memory of the Holocaust was the moral and ideological glue supporting and holding together this tripartite structure: Diaspora Jewry, Israel and enlightened nations were all determined that \u201cnever again\u201d would such a crime take place against Jews or anyone else.\n\nYet for the first time in its history, Israel is putting the sensibility and interests of Jewish communities on the back burner. Israel and its government have even shown a willingness to desacralize the memory of the Shoah and make deals with open or hidden anti-Semites. This is a fascinating phenomenon, one that begs the question: Why is that the case?\n\nNetanyahu here promotes a new vision of Zionism that demands a new international strategy, in response. Netanyahu has a deep political affinity to Trump, Orban and Morawiecki, and above all with Russian President Vladimir Putin. (During this summer\u2019s Trump-Putin summit in Helsinki, the leaders declared their mutual admiration, which is now on display for all to see.) Netanyahu has lost interest in the mostly liberal American Jewish community not only because by predilection he prefers to cultivate a few rich people rather than groups and communities (except at election time), but also because he has a genuine and authentic contempt for liberalism (the American Jewish community is predominantly liberal).\n\n", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "worldpolitics", "date_year_month": "2018-09", "created_utc_converted": "2018-09-19 17:02:18", "score_overall": 18, "words": "jewish holocaust holocaust jewish jewish jewish jew kosher jewish holocaust holocaust jewish holocaust jewish holocaust jewish jewish jewish", "shared_words": "jewish holocaust jew kosher", "socre_distint": 4}

The only new things are the more blatant antisemitism instead of the usual \"generally show weird idolation of Israel and engage in massive cultural appropriation of Jewish culture because our Xanatos Gambit to make Jesus come back and rapture us all pretty much depends on the existence of the Third Temple\"; pretty much *everything else* is, wholescale, ripped from NAR Satanic Panic narratives.  Probably one reason why Rodney Howard-Browne--a particular NAR leader quite close to Trump--pretty much has glommed onto the QAnon stuff; pretty much it's like putting a hand in a glove.)\n\nAnd, dare I say it, the \"Aliens are demons\" is by far one of the *less disturbing* things promoted in NAR circles.

{"archived": false, "author": "Kwanjai3KBattery", "body": "I think two things can simultaneously be true. One is that the left in general and Labour in particular has an issue with antisemitism. The other is that the issue is being weaponized by the, mostly gentile, political establishment as a tool against Corbyn because they are scared of him.\n\nOn the latter, absolutely this has been blown out of all proportion. The whole media narrative seems to be missing the fact that Labour is institutionally the party of the have-nots and the Tories are institutionally the party of the political elites. So racism - a manifestation of power against have-nots - is an issue Labour exists to prevent and the Tories exist to defend.\n\nThat's not to mention the hypocrisy. And we don't even need to bring in colour-of-skin racism and Islamaphobia there. Even when it comes down to antisemitism it was only a couple of years ago when Labour had an ethnically Jewish candidate for Prime Minister and the Tories and their media allies ran a dog-whistle antisemitic campaign against him saying he was part of a shadowy Hampstead liberal elite, had two kitchens, was bad at eating bacon sandwiches and stabbed his brother in the back. Each of these things is a code-phrase for Jewish. And yet there has been zero fuss made about this. \n\nThat said, I don't think it's for two gentiles like us to say \"this isn't a problem\". You and I have absolutely no idea what it's like to be Jewish on the left at the moment and I think there's been enough stories from ordinary Jewish members with no axe to grind to suggest that it is really crap and something needs to be done about that.\n\nI think the problem the left, in particular the pro-Palestine left of which Corbyn is a central figure, struggle so much with antisemitism is that it's a form of racism, and therefore a form of punching down, which frequently mendaciously disguises itself as a form of punching up, especially in relation to discussions around Israel where you have an entity with power which identifies itself as Jewish. That's where people tie themselves in knots and start throwing punches across or down which they think they're throwing up. Or to put it another way: yes it isn't antisemitic to criticise Israel, but yes it is antisemitic to criticise Israel using antisemitic tropes or by subbing in the word \"Israelis\" and then saying something that would be antisemitic if you subbed it back to \"Jews\".\n\nHence all the argument about definitions. Although I'm not sure that's helpful. Take this, written about a Jewish politician and his party:\n\n&gt; \"terrorist, right-wing chauvinist organization ... closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy and social appeal to the Nazi and Fascist parties ... preaching racial superiority... \ninaugurated a reign of terror in the Palestine Jewish community\"\n\nClearly under the IHRA definition that's antisemitic. But that letter was written by Hannah Arendt about Menachem Begin. Now clear common sense tells us a definition that accuses Arendt of antisemitism and prevents criticism of Begin is incorrect, but I actually think what's incorrect is the use of any definition, devoid of context and location. \n\nIf you are the 20th century's greatest moral philosopher, the author of \"Banality of Evil\" and a Jew who just narrowly avoided the Holocaust yourself and had relatives who weren't so lucky then there are things that you can say which someone else shouldn't say less thoughtfully for fear of contributing to a hostile atmosphere for Jewish people. Also I wonder if Arendt would even say that like that now, given how use of language has changed since to minimise needless harm.\n\nThis is my problem with the definitions debate. It means that we're all playing lawyer over words, rather than engaging with the sentiment behind the words. And I find that dangerous and I worry it will make antisemitism worse.\n\nThe other thing I find dangerous is linked to the question of \"why now\"? I think there's a number of reasons why now: you have an opportunistic right on the ropes and looking for anything they can weaponize against JC, you have a climate in the Labour party which is more pro-Palestine than at any previous time, you have an overtly and shamelessly racist PM of Israel further muddying the waters about where race sits in relation to the entitiy of the Israeli state and you have Corbyn's Trump like attitude to the media (by which I mean he prefers to communicate over them than engage with them and he invests absolutely nothing in damage control). But my fear is that people latch on to the first one and decide that this is just an elite conspiracy. And that elite conspiracy language is itself very dangerous because it leans in to antisemitic tropes of its own. I think some Jewish community leaders have been very irresponsible here in adding a veneer of plausibility to that absurd and offensive idea. Sachs and those three newspaper editors really do need to understand that if they misrepresent their community as being monolithic, and misrepresent themselves as being the gatekeepers of what that monolith thinks, then that's really dangerous. People on all sides need to understand that it is very very racist to boil down any community's opinion to a single point. Community leaders aren't.\n\nSorry that turned into a ramble, but I hope it helps explain why it is I don't entirely agree but think you're part right and worry about where this all leads. I guess one final thing to add is that the historian in me considers this all very very sad. Socialism, communism and anarchism grew out of the Jewish communities in east London. The terms have been almost synonymous throughout history. Just as the tory party = the church of England so the English far left = the Jewish community. That that is no longer the case, and that so many Jewish people would rather be complicit in their own oppression under capitalism than continue in the movement that grew from their community really represents a massive failure of our movement.", "score": 10, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "date_year_month": "2018-09", "created_utc_converted": "2018-09-23 11:31:45", "score_overall": 16, "words": "jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jew holocaust jewish conspiracy conspiracy jewish jewish jewish jewish", "shared_words": "jewish jew holocaust conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

I just think it's retarded how liberals try to police language and try to conflate using an ever-expanding list of boo-boo words with actual, heart-felt bigotry that exists. I've basically felt this way ever since I was a kid, since I remember educators trying to abuse other children and use them to promote their \"Don't say fag, retard, etc.\" agenda on the rest of us, I've just become more intelligent and better at expressing it over the years. *I must have been a really neo-nazi 12-year-old or something!* /s\n\n&gt;Not only is that not evidence of you not being antisemitic, but it's a false equivalence lol. You acknowledging Nazi hate speech against Jews doesn't mean you don't dislike Jews. \n\nHow do I... dislike Jews?\n\n&gt;Surely you who so vehemently despises Israel's government\n\nI actually don't, necessarily, per se. I certainly don't hate Israel as a whole, and there's a lot of things I actually admire about Bibi, in particular. He seems like a strong leader who genuinely cares about his people, and I don't think it's impossible for their interests to be compatible with my interests, as, well, I guess some actions taken by this administration prove to an extent. I mainly hate the hypocrisy, I hate how much influence the Zionist and liberal Jewish lobbies have over our government, culture, and society, yet instead of just be like \"Yeah we run shit, whatevs\" about it, they're constantly pointing fingers at \"Russians\" or \"Nazis\" like me apparently, even though my grandfather fought against the Nazis and as I already told you I grew up with Jews. I'm a white gentile who was born with white skin, therefore I'm a Nazi and remember goyim, the only good Nazi is a dead Nazi! *That's* what I hate.\n\n&gt;Aww that's cute, you replaced the word Israeli with Russian. \n\nYeah, that's kind of a joke.\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, half of that is propagandist dribble with a clearly biased agenda\n\n*No, ya think!?* A meme trying to challenge propagandist dribble with a clearly biased agenda is a piece of propaganda? **WOAAHH STOP THE PRESSES!**\n\n&gt;and the other half isn't even relevant. Who gives a shit if 13 senators have dual Israeli citizenship? \n\nThe point is you're supposed to explain why Israeli meddling is less of a big deal than the country that doesn't own 70% of our congresscritters through AIPAC, doesn't own 5 out of 6 of the major media conglomerates, doesn't make up 60% of the donations to one party and one-fourth of another, etc.. In other words, ***why the fuck should I care about Russian meddling in the first place?***\n\nAnd by the way, no matter how \"nazi or anti-Semite\" you think this question is, Ron and Rand Paul are both in the same boat as me on the Russia Question, so I'm not too self-conscious about being on the wrong side or \"axis of eeeeevil\" or whatever here.

I thought we were talking about the people investigating Trump, not some NYT reporter. Since when does Sarah Jeong reflect the attitudes of Mueller?\n\nBecause it all reflects one thing. The *New York Times* isn't just some random blog, it's America's \"paper of record\" and part and parcel with the US establishment. I think the fact that America's most elite paper, which has been owned by a Jewish family since the 19th century, is relevant when judging the credibility of the allegations against Russia or the moral integrity of those making them. As far as I'm concerned, you're telling me to be on the side of people who have demonstrated time and time again that they're no different from the Nazis - except, instead of wanting to exterminate Jews, they want to kill *me*. \n\n&gt;Btw, you're very mistaken if you think I don't despise the clear and racist attitude of Sarah Jeong. In one of the threads on this sub, I lambasted the NYT for its clear double standards in not firing that racist piece of shit. She's anti-white, and ultimaregem is a Nazi. It's that simple.\n\nOrrrrr maybe we could just not fire anyone because of controversial opinions they expressed a long time ago or in private? Just a thought. But that's not the point. It's still a matter of fact that we live in a society that has zero tolerance for \"nazis\", yet a great deal of tolerance for \"ironically\" joking about the extinction of the entire white race. As a white male, I have a problem with that, and are you going to call me a nazi because of that?\n\n&gt;...Good thing I never said that then? Nor do I want it both ways?\n\nOkay, but you're some guy on the internet.

Like, regardless of Silicon Valley's \"right\" to systematically censor and silence their political opposition, if I disagree with them doing that, then why should I be cool with the fact that multiple tech companies have partnered with the same, Jewish pressure groups, such as the ~~Askhenazi Defence League~~ Anti-Defamation League, giving them essentially a monopoly over regulating speech? Why, again, should I care more about the Russians, who *aren't doing that*?

That Russia purchased $300 million worth of drones from Israel in 2015 alone?\n\nYou: Jews control the media and the money. \nReality: Jews like Russians. \nYou: Jews blame Russians for everything??? \n\nYour delusions don't even make sense. By the way, paranoiacally believing that Jews own everything is an antisemitic trope going back centuries my friend. \n\n&gt;As far as I'm concerned, you're telling me to be on the side of people who have demonstrated time and time again that they're no different from the Nazis - except, instead of wanting to exterminate Jews, they want to kill me\n\nThere is no such side. As bad as progressives are, they don't want to kill you. Some are batshit insane enough to want to, but then again you're also batshit insane. The insanity of the few do not define the opinions of the many. Get out of your bubble, get some fresh air, and actually branch out to people. Then you might not have your delusions anymore.\n\n&gt;But that's not the point. It's still a matter of fact that we live in a society that has zero tolerance for \"nazis\", yet a great deal of tolerance for \"ironically\" joking about the extinction of the entire white race. As a white male, I have a problem with that\n\nI have a problem with it too. That still doesn't mean I think everything's a conspiracy theory out to kill me. \n\n&gt;As a white male, I have a problem with that, and are you going to call me a nazi because of that?\n\nActually I'm going to call you a Nazi for being a homophobe and an antisemite.\n\n&gt;Okay, but you're some guy on the internet. Doesn't change the reality we're living under now\n\nOkay, but *you're** some guy on the internet. Doesn't change the reality we're living under now, and the reality is very different from your delusions insinuate.\n\n&gt;It is. It is necessarily censorship.\n\nActually it's called terms of service. Most companies have them. When you sign their terms of service, you agree to play by their rules. You break their rules, don't be surprised if you get banned. Having terms of service is not censorship, nor is enforcing them. Alex Jones broke their rules, and social media platforms enforced them.\n\n&gt;Jew vs. Russian thing\n&gt;Askhenazi Defence League\n\nJeez man, you're not even trying to mask your antisemitism anymore xD. Everything is just some Jewish conspiracy to you. \"Oh but I grew up with Jews!\" \n\nHonestly, you get so offended when people call you a Nazi. You've convinced your self that everyone is wrong and out to get you. Did it ever occur to you that you are actually leaning on the side of Nazism? That there's a genuinely legitimate reason why people call you a Nazi? That you're wrong? I'm sure it did, and you simply don't care. Frankly, why do you even care if people call you a Nazi?

{"archived": false, "author": "CocoSavege", "body": "Annecdata here, following along this thread.\n\nI'm only marginally aware of the Corbyn scandal, most recently having listened to the intelligence squared debate.  The debate topic was something like \"is Corbyn a bad pm\" or something.  I'm not a Brit so at best I was vaguely aware.  But it turns out this particular scandal seems like big news.  Both of the speakers who are anti Corbyn spent a great deal of time, most of the allotted time it seems, on the anti semiticism scandal.  A smaller hunk of time was spent on Brexit, how Corbyn's weak Brexit response should be criticized.  Of interest perhaps, my impression was that some of the questions from the audience heavily conflated Corbyn's apparent support of Hamas and anti semiticism.  Which seems to indicate that there's a strong contingent of the Israel == Jewish Identity types in the audience.\n\nAnyways, for my first time I just looked at \"the mural\".  My first take is that it's a pretty standard anti capitalist trope thingy.  But I did look closer, because it's a thing and I would agree that about half? of the bankers look \"jewish\", in quotes because it's a mural.  Not super caricatured, but Jewish.  Because of this thread I went out and wiki'd the protocols and my quick take is the same as Op's, Jewish globalist conspiracy propaganda stuff.  Then I did an image search on the protocols and I saw more prototypical caricatured anti-Semitic stuff.  Jew spider, jewsnake and Jew eggs-and-claws stuff.  And some pretty sketchy parts of the internet is rather not visit.\n\nI'm sympathetic to the POV that Corbyn might not have recognized the somewhat subtle anti semiticism of the mural.  I agree that not recognizing the mural for being anti-Semitic is worthy of being called out but I would be mindful that beating that horse over and over seems like cheap pop, if Corbyn did what I did and said \"oh, I get what you mean there\" hammering it over and over seems like an attack of the weak rather than a fundamental criticism.\n\nWhat I was looking for was perhaps anti-Semitic versions of typical anticap posters like https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-capitalism#/media/File%3AAnti-capitalism_color\u2014_Restored.png (which seems to not be anti-Semitic).\n\nI'm not sure what readers might take away from this, just sharing my experience of seeing the mural for the first time.\n\n\n", "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "date_year_month": "2018-09", "created_utc_converted": "2018-09-23 17:33:34", "score_overall": 8, "words": "jewish jewish jewish jewish globalist conspiracy jew jew", "shared_words": "jewish globalist conspiracy jew", "socre_distint": 4}

Interestingly, antisemitism specifically has always been different than other forms of racism in western countries.

Blood libel, dirty greedy Jew, Jews run the media, Jews control the weather, Jews run the deep state, etc.\n\nOn the left: Intersectionality has a habit of excluding Jews because \"they don't experience systemic racism\" or \"they're persecuted the least, so other minority groups come first.

Also, blaming Jews and forcing them to make a statement on Israel upon learning they're Jewish is antisemitic the same way that blaming a Muslim for ISIS and forcing them to make a statement upon learning their Muslim is Islamaphobic.

{"archived": false, "author": "kusuriurikun", "body": "This.  For the ones who aren't OG Anti-Semitic, there's some extensive rebrandings of things (you'll hear more \"Illuminati/Satanic Panic\" stuff from groups outside traditional racist and fascist groups); a lot of times Jewish people who are not right in line with the endtime theologies of many dominionist groups are said to have their \"hearts hardened\" or even called \"Secular Jews\" (which is intended as very much a slur).\n\nAnd for those unfamiliar with what Loptional is on about: The endtime theology of a good portion of the dominionist movement in the US and Canada that have supported \"Christian Zionism\" (and especially those that tend to use the Scofield Reference Bible and are premillenial-dispensationalist, including the New Apostolic Reformation movement and groups influenced by them) essentially has a few major narratives to the effect of roughly the following:\n\n1. Israel is re-established as a state, and both before and after this happens the world's Jewish population is forced to Israel (some variants of this within New Apostolic Reformation actually get pretty frankly anti-Semitic, including claims that none other than *Hitler* was \"doing God's work\" with the Holocaust as it forced Europe's surviving Jewish population to flood into the Mandate of Palestine and found Israel).  This is considered one of the Essential Steps before Jesus can actually come back and rapture off the Saved\n2. At some point after Israel is re-established, Israel finds a red heifer and builds the Third Temple on the site of the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque (pretty much this would produce a Shitstorm of Epic Proportions) and re-establishes the old priesthood in full.  This, too, is generally considered one of the Essential Steps before Jesus can come back.\n3. Many (if not most) groups that have Israel as part of their endtimes theology Xanatos Gambit call for territorial expansion of Israel to the largest claimed extent of Israel and Judah (which includes not only the West Bank and Gaza, includes not only the Sinai Peninsula that was ceded to Egypt in the 70s after being occupied by Israel after the Yom Kippur War, but also considerable sections of Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan).  This, likewise, is generally considered an Essential Step before Jesus Can Come Back Already by many \"Christian Zionist\" orgs, and this actually leads to some rather nasty Islamophobia/Palestiniophobia including calls for genocide (under the assumption all Palestinians are essentially Hamas; a non-negligible percentage of Palestinians are actually *Christians* from *very* old, pre-Catholic denominations).\n4. Quite a lot of New Apostolic Reformation (and even \"OG Pentecostal\") groups have as part of their endtime theology that Jesus cannot come back until at least one convertee exists from every ethnic group on the planet, and quite a lot of them also have very specific calls that Jewish people must be converted to forms of Christianity that also incorporate a lot of cultural appropriation of Jewish culture (more on that in a bit).  The latter also calls back to some very specific endtime theology, namely:\n5. In a lot of NAR endtime theologies in particular, two Jewish people in Israel are supposed to convert spontaneously to \"Messianic Judaism\" after the Rapture happens.  When the Antichrist takes over the world (mythologies vary as to where Satan Headquarters is going to be) apparently Israel is to be turned into the World's Largest Ghetto, and sometime in the middle of the Tribulation (the seven-year period between the Rapture and, well, essentially Jesus Third Impact--we'll get into that in a bit) those two convertees essentially get martyred.\n6. When the Rapture finally happens, according to a LOT of NAR-influenced endtime theologies there is supposed to be a massive war that breaks out.  (In pretty much every narrative since the founding of Israel, this is HIGHLY implied to be an actual nuclear war that is in fact started because someone from \"Gog and Magog\" tried to actively invade Israel.  Yes, apparently Israel starting a war leading the the end of the human race is in fact part of their *essential endtime mythology*, though the actual timing of said Nuke War varies with the particular Christian Zionist group.)\n7. In NAR endtime theologies in particular, the martyrdom of those two post-Rapture Spontaneous Convertees...pretty much triggers, spontaneously, a massive end-times Tent Revival and Wolverines Resistance in Israel itself.  The narratives vary as to numbers of convertees (some variants say 144,000 Jewish people will eventually convert to being kosher neopentecostals, some say pretty much all of Judaism will spontaneously convert right then and there) and pretty much all the narratives do call for the vast majority of the world's Jewish population to have been herded to Israel for the purpose of being slaughtered en masse over the next few years..\n8. After all this (again, according to the mythologies of quite a lot of Christian Zionists and especially the NAR) Jesus comes back *again* (seven years after the Rapture when he came back the first time and raptured up the Good and Properly Dominionist Folk and went back into the skies)...and pretty much *the entirety of the rest of humanity that has not converted to dominionist Christianity is wiped out to the last man, woman and child and their souls destroyed in the Lake of Fire* (oh, yeah, Hell and Satan are also being destroyed so pretty much totally writing those folks out of existence even in the afterlife).   In a lot of NAR-influenced endtime mythology that calls for Israel starting a nuclear war that ends the world, the \"Israeli nuke war\" happens either here or just after the Rapture (some variants basically have seven years of Mad Max, some just seven years of mere Satanic Dystopia).  Quite a lot of variants also pretty much have the Christians resurrected who died, some include the Jewish population (who in their endtime mythology pretty much immediately go Kosher Christian if they haven't already), and pretty much Jesus leads all the good little boys and girls to a new heaven and earth and away from the post-nuclear-holocaust ruined hellscape of the planet.\n9. And if this wasn't confusing enough, a lot of NAR groups actually posit the \"Second Coming\" as being the coming of a \"Corporate Christ\"--basically the lot of them mass-possessed by the Son-o-God Himself and essentially being Christian Legion (for they are many) that eventually ends up summoning actual in-the-flesh Christ.  And pretty much believe the \"all nations must be converted\" explicitly includes *governmental systems* being made Properly Dominionist (yes, essentially the *entire point* of the \"Religious Right\" with these groups is essentially Prosperity Gospel-based \"name it and claim it\" of the governments of multiple nations and their culture--read up on \"Seven Mountains Theology\" sometime.  Yes, it's weird).

Jewish Talmud teaches them that any non Jew is a goyim. Goyim means cattle. Jews believe goyim are only here to serve Jews. We work for them, we pay taxes to them. We borrow and pay interest to them. The Jewish talmud says all non Jewish women are born into filth. It is okay to have sex with a gentile child of 9. If a goyim loses something, and a Jew finds it there is no reason to return it.\n\n&gt;It is okay to rip off a goyim. The talmud states that Jesus is boiling in shit in hell. Lastly the Jewish Talmud states that dor a goyim to learn anything about the teachings of the Talmud would be equivalent to the murder of all Jews. If the Goyim learns what we teach about them, surely they will kill us.\n\n&gt;Jews expelled or kicked out if you will from over 100 nations on Earth, but its everyone elses fault and they are just innocent scapegoats. Circumcision was a replacement for ritualistic jewish child sacrifice. Goyim caught on to the child murdering or \" blood libel\" and the Jews had to find a way to still please their god Baphomet or Saturn ( yes their true god is known to us as Lucifer).

Black rights activists, communists and socialists, anti-war activists, have all been targeted and silenced historically by the US government. Today what's most common is the silencing of critics of Israel. Norman Finkelstein lost his career over it. And of course the persecution of those of other religions/ethnicities (we all remember the ground zero mosque affair) and black rights activists (Kaepernick) still continues. \n\n[This is a good article about the myth of liberal intolerance on campuses](https://www.thenation.com/article/the-myth-of-liberal-intolerance/)\n\n[And this one is great about the *real* dangerous ideas that are shunned (hint:its not racism)](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/05/the-real-dangerous-ideas)\n\nAnyway, I'll try to address all of your points:\n\nOne.I don't know if that puts minorities in a dangerous position. More so than allowing groups to invite openly racist and hateful speakers? There are two sides to free speech, and I think you're not considering the other side. \n\nWhen you invite and normalize speech that is hateful toward a certain demographic, you are effectively limiting the free speech of those who his speech targets. If I am inviting an anti-semitic speaker, and he openly says hateful things to a big crowd and no one protests or speaks up, how would a jewish student feel? Would she feel comfortable in that environment? Would she feel capable of speaking up? No. To protect the racists, we are silencing their victims. So, I guess, there has to be somewhat of a balance. \n\nStudents shutting down a speaker is always fine, even if its bad optics. That's something the deplatformed speaker has to live with. \n\nAdministration shutting down an event should be done if they think it'll contribute to a hostile atmosphere. And this is key here, and I think I'll come back to it. Speech leading to a hostile environment leading to hostile actions. Speech becoming action. \n\nTwo. I don't think most places are conducive to discussions where people are open to changing their minds. I was involved briefly in a group where we discussion the palestinian conflict and no one changed their minds. Online or in real life, it's difficult to get people to shift their stances. And realistically, who is going to go to an event where a racist is speaking? Other racists. It's still an echo chamber. \nYou'd have to show us some evidence that allowing, for example, a neo-nazi to speak on campus led to an open dialogue and changing of minds. I haven't seen it happen.\n\nThree. I think I mostly agree with this point. That administration can't be trusted to enforce rules even-handedly. I think a more democratic approach is needed so that it reflects the overriding atmosphere on campus or community and not the feelings of one person. \n\nBut also, free speech itself is not allowed equally. And this is part of people's distrust with the concept of free speech. Minorities, for example, are not allowed the same freedom to share their thoughts and feelings as white people. As an immigrant, I know that saying anything against the war in Iraq back in 2003 was bad. It was anti-American. With your speech you have to constantly prove that you aren't an outsider or a traitor. \n\nI mean, overall, the idea that people are free to say whatever they want is wrong. There are all sorts of unspoken rules and cultural and political pressures to say the right things or not say anything at all. And some of those are bad (suppressing anti-war sentiment), and some of those are good (suppressing racism). And its a sign of a healthy society where people stick up for marginalized groups and don't let bigots speak.\n\nAnyway, I'll address the speech becoming action thing. I think a lot of the time people complain about \"thought policing\" or \"censorship\" what they are really talking about is common sense controls over real harm that their words can cause.\n\nSo take the C-16 bill that protected gender expression from harassment in Canada. Jordan Peterson made a big deal about him getting arrested over misgendering someone and going on hunger strike.\n\nThe reason he hasn't been arrested yet is because the law basically protects a marginalized and targeted group (trans and queer people) from harassment in a public place or business. It has nothing to do with saying you don't believe trans women are women, or that using \"they\" as a perversion of the English language (lol).\n\nWhen speech becomes harassment, or when it becomes libelous, it becomes action. You aren't controlling speech anymore, you are controlling the very real, material harm the words are causing. We have had laws protecting against harassment and libel and slander for a long time, and they make sense. \n\nWhen Milo Yiannopolis was popular, he was going around encouraging people to narc on undocumented immigrants. He was outing trans people and encouraging violence against them. And this kind of thing is dangerous. It's not speech anymore. It's creeping into action. It's threatening.\n\nThe question I would ask you is, if a radical Islamic cleric visited your university and gave a speech, would you feel like protecting it? Or would it be going too far? \n\nAnd if a conspiracy theorist who believed 9/11 was a false flag was invited to speak, and the administration stepped up and said no we don't you to speak. Did they go too far? Should we take every crackpot theory seriously and give every idiot a platform?\n\n", "score": 68, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "date_year_month": "2018-09", "created_utc_converted": "2018-09-27 21:08:10", "score_overall": 5, "words": "silencing jewish silencing libel conspiracy", "shared_words": "silencing jewish libel conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

That's why I stated in my original post:\n\n&gt;In addition, particularly with punishment, I don't think administrators are likely to apply a rule punishing those who say things offensive will be limited to one particular sides' \"offensiveness\". In other words, if someone black says the words \"white trash\" in reference to a joke or meme, and the administrator who created the rule also happens to be a silent racist, nothing prevents the administrator from imposing the rule on the black person. Administrators - because they exist in the power structures minorities tend to have their issues with - are extremely unlikely to even impose punitive rules regarding the limitation of offensive speech correctly, because they have every incentive to hold onto the powers that limit minorities in the first place.\n\n...\n\n&gt;One.I don't know if that puts minorities in a dangerous position.

We are having massive protests *prior* *to* some speakers even getting to a school.\nAdditionally, I think we can speak up in public spaces, and that the power to speak is something that isn't taken away by an invite to a group with a differing view. If someone is frightened of speaking out against hate, that is objectively awful, but the hate is going to exist with or without such a speaker, as I have said elsewhere. If someone who hates Israel is invited to speak at a college, the event won't exist in a vacuum. However, if such a speaker is dis-invited, it artificially creates a social vacuum where discussion does not occur at all. As I point out in my \"Thirdly\" section, this is also disastrous for minority groups like those on the left.\n\n&gt;Administration shutting down an event should be done if they think it'll contribute to a hostile atmosphere.

Speech becoming action.\n\nOk this should be interesting, so I'm excited for the rest lol. Hype!\n\n&gt;Two. I don't think most places are conducive to discussions where people are open to changing their minds. I was involved briefly in a group where we discussion the palestinian conflict and no one changed their minds. Online or in real life, it's difficult to get people to shift their stances. And realistically, who is going to go to an event where a racist is speaking? Other racists. It's still an echo chamber. You'd have to show us some evidence that allowing, for example, a neo-nazi to speak on campus led to an open dialogue and changing of minds. I haven't seen it happen.\n\nhttps://www.univision.com/univision-news/united-states/she-used-to-be-a-neo-nazi-now-she-helps-people-leave-hate-groups\n\n\"King says no one decides to suddenly rethink their hateful beliefs after being assaulted, whether physically or verbally. In most cases, it has the \u201cexact opposite effect.\u201d\n\nSomeone punched in the face is given ammunition and the ability to excuse their actions by rationalizing that the person who punched them is 'actually the violent one,' King says.\"\n\nThere are very similar stories to hers all across the internet if you actively search for them. I agree it's difficult to get people to shift their stances, and I also agree it's difficult to find settings where that can happen, but I disagree with the notion that it is not possible, and I disagree that only racists go to public events where racists speak.\n\n&gt;Three. I think I mostly agree with this point. That administration can't be trusted to enforce rules even-handedly. I think a more democratic approach is needed so that it reflects the overriding atmosphere on campus or community and not the feelings of one person.\n\nSo \"Majority Rule\"?\n\n&gt;But also, free speech itself is not allowed equally. And this is part of people's distrust with the concept of free speech. Minorities, for example, are not allowed the same freedom to share their thoughts and feelings as white people. As an immigrant, I know that saying anything against the war in Iraq back in 2003 was bad. It was anti-American. With your speech you have to constantly prove that you aren't an outsider or a traitor.\n\nI'm arguing it should be allowed, that these social pressures that you are talking about in public forums is wrong.\n\n&gt;I mean, overall, the idea that people are free to say whatever they want is wrong. There are all sorts of unspoken rules and cultural and political pressures to say the right things or not say anything at all. And some of those are bad (suppressing anti-war sentiment), and some of those are good (suppressing racism). And its a sign of a healthy society where people stick up for marginalized groups and don't let bigots speak.\n\nYes, and I believe most of them depend on time and place, hence my assertion of this being about a public forum setting, like a public college or university.\n\n&gt;Anyway, I'll address the speech becoming action thing. I think a lot of the time people complain about \"thought policing\" or \"censorship\" what they are really talking about is common sense controls over real harm that their words can cause.\n\nOk I'll bite\n\n&gt;So take the C-16 bill that protected gender expression from harassment in Canada. Jordan Peterson made a big deal about him getting arrested over misgendering someone and going on hunger strike.\n\n&gt;The reason he hasn't been arrested yet is because the law basically protects a marginalized and targeted group (trans and queer people) from harassment in a public place or business. It has nothing to do with saying you don't believe trans women are women, or that using \"they\" as a perversion of the English language (lol).\n\n&gt;When speech becomes harassment, or when it becomes libelous, it becomes action. You aren't controlling speech anymore, you are controlling the very real, material harm the words are causing. We have had laws protecting against harassment and libel and slander for a long time, and they make sense.\n\n&gt;When Milo Yiannopolis was popular, he was going around encouraging people to narc on undocumented immigrants. He was outing trans people and encouraging violence against them. And this kind of thing is dangerous. It's not speech anymore. It's creeping into action. It's threatening.\n\nI agree with some of this, actually. But part of me also thinks my agreement isn't rooted in anything beyond the emotions I have in reaction to what you wrote. I want my agreement to be in something with more -er- foundation than my emotions? How I feel about something is often never how something is, and those feeling based assumptions about other things led to a lot of misplaced blame.\n\n&gt;The question I would ask you is, if a radical Islamic cleric visited your university and gave a speech, would you feel like protecting it? Or would it be going too far?\n\nI would want it protected as free speech, barring any specific physical attacks on the crowd (kind of weird that I just used the word protected and then said \"barring any specific attack... because the protection shouldn't be one-sided), which I would hope is unlikely to occur.\n\n&gt;And if a conspiracy theorist who believed 9/11 was a false flag was invited to speak, and the administration stepped up and said no we don't you to speak. Did they go too far? Should we take every crackpot theory seriously and give every idiot a platform?\n\nWe shouldn't disable them from speaking, no. Their ideas will be judged by their merits, honestly, and be completely rejected.\n\nEdit: Specifically in the examples of being \"outed,\" I do generally think we have a right to personal privacy, so I would agree with most of that on those grounds to protect individuals. You have found an exception, thanks! \u0394\n\nEdit 2: The editing you made of:\n\n&gt;There are two sides to free speech, and I think you're considering the other side.\n\nto:\n\n&gt;There are two sides to free speech, and I think you're not considering the other side.\n\nMakes me sad. I very clearly am considering both sides in the initial post, but I don't find the arguments in favor of limiting free speech in the situation of offensiveness, convincing in most cases, as it is alleged that the limitation of speech deals with prejudice better than the freedom of speech, something I think is incorrect.", "score": 5, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "date_year_month": "2018-09", "created_utc_converted": "2018-09-27 22:42:17", "score_overall": 5, "words": "silencing jewish silencing libel conspiracy", "shared_words": "silencing jewish libel conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

Prepare to be terrified. \n\nThe Talmud is composed of two parts, the Mishnah and Gemarah. The Mishnah is a compilation of the \"oral Torah\" as redacted by a dude named Judah Ha-Nasi, like 1700 years ago. The oral Torah is like, basically a bunch of memes that various rabbis had come up with to interpret the Torah to apply it to daily life. \n\nThen more rabbis wrote more shit on the Mishnah for a few more hundred years and this was redacted into a second commentary, called the Gemarah. So basically we have two books and the second one is a collection of commentary on the first, which is also a collection of commentary. Okay there are two versions of the Talmud because different people redacted the commentary but this is already long. But it's complicated.\n\nAnyway, basically the Talmud is a record of DEBATES. Eventually various things win out over others. You can find lots of shit that no one does or believes in the Talmud because that crazy idea died with the rabbi who said it. The Talmud is not a holy book, it's like, a lot of commentary on holy books. Most Jews don't bother to read it because it's long, boring, legalistic, and mostly written in Aramaic. I had a roommate once who went to a yeshiva high school in New Jersey (same one as Jared Kushner, actually) who had to read the Talmud in school but suffice to say that lots and lots of Jews don't ever bother. It IS the source of lots of ideas about how to engage in the world as a Jew but Jews do sooooo many things differently from other Jews based on what their rabbi told them or what tradition they're part of that it's hilarious to think that anything ever is set in stone.*\n\nJewish law is called \"Halacha\" (from the root H-L-KH, meaning \"to go\") because it is a changing, moving law. Even today, rabbis issue responsas commenting on how to interpret the Torah in modern times and how to apply Jewish law. The Talmud is just part of this tradition. \n\n*Example, even though this is approaching novel length: the idea that  eating meat and milk together is not kosher comes from the Talmud - the Torah basis for this is kind of vague. But after eating dairy, when is it okay to eat meat again? Is it like, immediate? Maybe an hour? Two hours? I've known people who say five hours and some who say six.

As I've said, that's not what they focus on when they're talking about the Jews.\n\n\"Some elements of the alt-right are anti-Semitic but others are tolerant of Jews.[82] Many in the alt-right believe that there is a Jewish conspiracy within the United States to achieve \"white genocide\", the elimination of white people as a racial group and their replacement with non-whites.[83] They believe that a Jewish cabal controls the U.S. government, media, and universities, and is pursuing its aim of white genocide by spreading anti-white tropes and encouraging African-American civil rights groups.[84] As evidence for this supposed white genocide, these far-right figures point to the depiction of mixed-race couples or children on television and the publication of articles discouraging women from having children early in life.[85] They also cite apparent instances of white self-hatred using Rachel Dolezal \u2013 an American woman of European descent who identifies as black \u2013 as evidence.[86]\n\nThis anti-Semitic conspiracy theory is not new to the alt-right, but has recurred among far-right groups in Western countries since the 19th century; it was the reason for the Holocaust and various anti-Semitic pogroms in European history.[84] Andrew Anglin, one of the most prominent alt-right ideologues and a member of its neo-Nazi wing, stated that \"the core concept of the movement, upon which all else is based, is that Whites are undergoing an extermination, via mass immigration into White countries which was enabled by a corrosive liberal ideology of White self-hatred, and that the Jews are at the center of this agenda.\"[87] He added that for the alt-right, \"the goal is to ethnically cleanse White nations of non-Whites and establish an authoritarian government. Many people also believe that the Jews should be exterminated.\"[88][89][90] Other alt-rightists, like Spencer, welcome the involvement of Jews within their movement.\" \n\nLiterally on the alt-right wikipedia page, fuck me.\n\n&gt;Women getting shorter sentences on average isn't privilege by definition. Circumstance isn't privilege. So you and your friend walk down the street at the same speed but you feel down and broken your arm. Is that privilege or that circumstance? Its circumstance\n\nIt literally is. Stop with these mental gymnastics and awful metaphors.\n\n&gt;Are you honestly trying to play dunce? Women aren't all white. So you're going to have overlap. Stats don't work that way. Notice how I talk spefics while you speaking in generalities. You can be a white woman and get white privilege. You're conflating 2 sets of data and giving them the same context\n\nOh right then in your case your stats are wrong. Because of all those black guys how many of them are actually fully black? Maybe many of them are half white. Maybe many of them are only 10% black. Mental gymnastics from you again.\n\n&gt;Odd because I used to go to a black church, attend Caribbean events all my life, have a black brother and mother and aunts. Some how you're telling me that I've never met a black person? dude I'm 1/2 black and part Asian\n\nYou can't read. I said \"it's like\". That's not meant to be taken literal. \n\n&gt;Not really but there are examples of this.\n\nThere are also places that non-whites get turned away from on the basis of their skin because companies like to hit certain quotes and look like they're more 'diverse'. \n\n&gt;I do get a higher call back rate when I don't use an Asian sounding name\n\nNo proof of that at all. I also have two different names and had more success under a different name. Both names were English but if I were you, I'd probably find a way to make it about discrimination too.\n\n&gt;That's not true at all. Can you even say that even in 2018. Which communities face voter suppression? Not white people. Which group is currently is currently having their 4th amendments taken away? Not white people. Even if you want to bring up specific laws\n\nEvery election and local voting process me and my sisters get the exact same shit sent to us in the mail. So don't bs.\n\n&gt;Your \"sister\" will probably face a longer sentence than you despite being a woman\n\nNo, she wouldn't. Being a woman gets you a LOT less time in jail than the difference from black to white.\n\n&gt;Your \"sister\" is about 3x more likely to face a hate crime than you if you want to look up FBI stats\n\nYeah, that will happen in a country dominated by white people the exact same way hate crime towards whites are way more common in Africa.\n\n&gt;Your \"sister\" is more likely to be stopped an invaded by stop and frisk policies while you're not.\n\nFunny because every time we've been together and we've been stopped, they've only checked me and not my sisters at all.

Now, the lefties tend to support programs that de-radicalize radical individuals, which conservatives seem to **hate** because it means they are given a second chance at life or whatever. I personally see it as a good thing: you are giving someone a chance to live without being embroiled in violent and hateful ideology. I can also see why people would oppose such programs, for example, if they are unconvinced that it would be possible to deradicalize someone.\n\nNobody who takes leftwing ideologies seriously should actually be supporting someone who called white people unbreeding goblins, though. That's the kind of racism that cannot be allowed to fester, lest it blow up into horrible ideologies further down the road. Anyone who does support someone after such a claim is engaging in tribalism.\n\n&gt; Also, it's beyond extremely fucked up that you think the government should actively shut down Fox News and take them off the air. \n\nlol wut\n\nI did not say those things. Here is the exact quotation, with context:\n\n&gt;  If you think \"hey, Fox News shouldn't be allowed to lie on-air and call themselves a news station\" counts as censorship, then I guess I'm pro-censorship.\n\nWhy would you immediately jump to \"use the government's monopoly on force to shut down a media company and disallow them to broadcast\"? \n\nWhy would you think that when the solutions are contained within the quotation itself? They could be forced to stop lying. They could be forced to stop calling themselves a news station. You can even do this via soft-pressure; just keep fining them for lying and claiming themselves to be news until it becomes unprofitable to do so.\n\n&gt; How do you think that historical atrocities like the Holocaust and Holodomor happened?\n\nA small group of people masterfully played off the hostilities and resentment in a given population, and managed to demonize a given minority within the population.

In the spring of 1935, a German documentary film, Abyssinia Today, was widely distributed within the Third Reich and it was enthusiastically reviewed by German newspapers.  The documentary was highly sympathetic toward Haile Selassie and presented his rule as one of enlightenment and modernization.  At the same time, newspapers in the Third Reich printed articles ridiculing the Italian Army and predicting its defeat if it invaded Ethiopia.\n\n&gt;While the British and French stopped arms from being shipped through their territories to the Ethiopians, the Nazis provided the Ethiopians with a vast amount of weapons and ammunition to fight the Fascist invader.  This included 16,000 rifles and 600 machine guns, as well as many submachine guns and hand grenades.  Japan also provided the Ethiopians with weapons to fight the Fascists.  This resulted in a counter-offensive in December 1935 successful enough for German and British military analysts to believe that Italy could not win in Ethiopia. \n\n&gt;...Mussolini in 1914 was one of the leading Marxists on the planet (something Trotsky noted at the time). \n\nIt makes sense when you consider Mussolini's initial Marxist ties whereas Hitler developed his views independently \n\n[Jewish supremacists however supported socialists overwhelmingly](http://www.alba-valb.org/resources/document-library/letter-from-hyman-katz-to-his-mother) as Rabbi Katz's letter details, because \"progressive Jews\" hate any sort of white/european identity:\n\n&gt;...Seeing all these things--how fascism is grasping power in many countries (including the U.S., where there are many Nazi organizations and Nazi agents and spies)--can\u2019t you see that fascism is our problem--that it may come to us as it came in other countries? And don\u2019t you realize that we Jews will be the first to suffer if fascism comes?\n\n&gt;But if we didn\u2019t see clearly the hand of Mussolini and Hitler in all these countries, in Spain we can\u2019t help seeing it. Together with their agent, Franco, they are trying to set up the same anti-progressive, anti-Semitic regime in Spain, as they have in Italy and Germany.\n\n&gt;If we sit by and let them grow stronger by taking Spain, they will move on to France and will not stop there; and it won\u2019t be long before they get to America. Realizing this, can I sit by and wait until the beasts get to my very door--until it is too late, and there is no one I can call on for help? And would I even deserve help from others when the trouble comes upon me, if I were to refuse help to those who need it today? If I permitted such a time to come--as a Jew and a progressive, I would be among the first to fall under the axe of the fascists;--all I could do then would be to curse myself and say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I wake up when the alarm-clock rang?\u201d\n\n\nDespite Katz's whining about Franco in Spain, [Franco was not antisemitic](http://strangeside.com/ww2-franco-helps-jews/) and that doesn't stop Jewish supremacists from trying to desecrate his grave\n\n&gt;During World War II, Spanish dictator, Francisco Franco, played a delicate balancing game. While trading and helping Germany on the one hand, he resolutely refused to join Hitler\u2019s Axis powers on the other and maintained a sort of neutrality. As Hitler said after an unsuccessful attempt to talk him around in 5700/1940, \u201cI would rather spend two hours in the dentist\u2019s chair than have another meeting with him.\u201d The most the Germans got from him was the Blue Division, which fought on the Russian front for three years until recalled after vociferous complaints from the Allies.\n\n&gt;Although not an unequivocal lover of Jews, Franco sporadically helped Jews escape the Nazis\u2019 clutches and published a widely disseminated booklet titled \u201cSpain and the Jews,\u201d boasting of all he had done.\n\n&gt;The best known instance of Spanish aid was during 5694/1944 when Budapest Jews were being railroaded to Auschwitz and numbers of neutral diplomats were striving to save as many as they could. Although the most famous of them was Raoul Wallenberg who had been sent by Sweden for that express purpose, there were many others. These included the Spanish Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires (ambassador) to Hungary, \u00c1ngel Sanz Briz and his successor, Giorgi Perlasca.

So this has been a complete waste of time and effort on my part and I no longer have any reason to believe that you'll shift my views or vice versa. Which means I'm done here after I address a glaring bit of historical legend so thoroughly discredited that you don't often hear it even from literal Neo-Nazis.\n\n&gt; It's impossible that any Jews murdered any Christian children in a 1,000 year span. Jews are incapable of sin, everyone knows that.\n\nNo one sensible is arguing that no Christian children were ever murdered by Jewish people during the Medieval and early modern periods. If nothing else because that would be impossible to prove and people murder each other all the time. But I haven't heard of a single blood libel story that holds up to scrutiny.\n\nBlood libel isn't random murders. It's about the idea of Jewish religious ceremonies, generally Passover, involving the ritual sacrifice and typically cannibalism of (invariably Christian) children. Which, if you know anything at all about Jewish law, is ludicrous. \n\nJews are prohibited from consuming blood of any kind. So the use of blood to make matzo is out. Human flesh is also considered unclean to eat, so that's out. Human sacrifice is portrayed as an act of the evil unbelievers in the Torah (for the most part, I can think of one passage where a man sacrifices his daughter after a promise he made to God goes awry), so it was pretty clearly not a practice the people putting the Torah together thought highly of. And by late Antiquity, the sacrifice of animals in Jewish custom was pretty much entirely restricted to the great temple at Jerusalem, though I wouldn't rule out rural Jews still practicing it occasionally. That temple no longer existed when blood libel stories start popping up and Jewish custom had shifted to the idea that animal sacrifice could *only* be permitted there. So secret human sacrifices are doubly out for a pious Medieval Jew.\n\n&gt; How did St. Simon of Trent die?\n\nI'll preface this part with a TL;DR. I have no idea, and neither does the Catholic Church. The blood libel trials involved no actual evidence, and in general follow the pattern of a lynch mob rather than an orderly legal proceeding. Kind of like the later witch trials.\n\nDo you think that every martyrdom story is accurate? Shortly before his death, a wandering preacher apparently had been stoking anti-Jewish sentiment in the town. The people blamed happened to be fairly wealthy, allowed to run their businesses in the town on sufferance of the local Prince-Bishop. So you can see why they'd be obvious targets for a lynch mob.\n\nAccording to a Catholic historian, [Simon's body was discovered in a ditch](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15035a.htm). That said, from my cursory research it's unclear as to where the body was actually found. The confessions were made under torture, which is always unreliable. The papal investigation into the matter denied the martyrdom account, and another Bishop tried to bring actual church proceedings against the Prince Bishop who oversaw the trials. The Prince-Bishop apparently responded with only a letter describing the martyrdom account.\n\nAlso, calling him a Saint seems questionable. While he has been venerated as one, it's not actually clear that he was ever canonized. He may have been at some point a century after his death, but from the offhand reference I was able to find, it seems a bit fuzzy. He is no longer considered a martyr by the Church, and doesn't appear in any modern Catholic calendar.", "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "CrusaderKings", "date_year_month": "2018-10", "created_utc_converted": "2018-10-07 18:02:01", "score_overall": 12, "words": "conspiracy jewish libel libel jewish jewish jewish libel jewish jew libel jewish", "shared_words": "conspiracy jewish libel jew", "socre_distint": 4}

It just means \"any act of censoring people\".\n\n&gt; It tries to argue that freedom of speech means freedom of consequences. Which it doesn't.\n\nIt kinda does though. If I want to start a new club in college called the free speech club, it'll be a free speech club since I'll allow anyone to join regardless of their opinions. If I didn't want that, I'd call it the College Democrats or Republicans instead. The College Republicans isn't a free speech club.\n\nYou also seem to be implying the classic SJW talking point of \"free speech only applies to the government\". It doesn't. Read some classically liberal literature by J.S. Mill.\n\n&gt;Your entire stance is contradictory and sounds more like some white supremacist mental gymnastics to make it seem like something sinister is going on.\n\nI like how you had to throw in random anti-whiteness in a sub dedicated to a Socialist Atheistic Jew of all people, because of course, that makes sense. Bernie Sanders has so many white supremacist fanboys you know.\n\nWhy would you expect anyone to take your opinions on Alex Jones or any other issue seriously when you openly hate &gt;50% of the population of the United States due to the immutable skin color we were born with? Remember when you were talking about civility?\n\nAlex is a cult leader and his followers are deep in the kool-aid. He could become god emperor of the world eating babies on live television and his cult would support him and declare the deep state is really aliens from another planet that are kidnapping kids for secret intergalactic pedophile rings. Because that is how cults operate. \n\nOkay, so what?\n\nLet him speak. You think someone is a cult leader. So let him do his own thing and let other people listen if they want, instead of going out of your way to try to silence him and anyone who likes him and ruin their lives, since newsflash: That's actual cult behavior. \"We need to make an example out of the infidels\" etc. etc., that's you, not Bernie Sanders fans or Alex Jones.\n\n&gt;Q is another similar cult who is so convinced that Robert Muller is actually working with Trump to take down a secret deep state democrat led pedo ring. Because even the concept that maybe Trump or at least the people who worked under him might have done a few under handed things and maybe committed a little treason is inconceivable to them.\n\nOkay, again: So what? I'm not a fan of the Qtards, since they're annoying, But they're not a *threat* to anyone and it actually offends me that idiots like you have the gall to pretend like they are when there's an actual terrorist organization, antifa, enforcing your own SJW views on innocent people through violent force on the streets of America. Look up the videos from Portland last weekend if you think it's something that's fizzled out recently.\n\nI like how you didn't explain how something like The_Mueller isn't just as cultish as GreatAwakening was. It seems to me like anyone assuming that Robert Mueller and the deep state are actually \"the good guys\" working against an evil Russian illuminati conspiracy to take over the US government through fake twitter accounts is at least just as paranoid and conspiratorial as you described, but interestingly, no one ever gets banned or ostracized or marginalized or humiliated for defending the straight read of the Mueller probe. I wonder why.\n\n\n&gt;But this isn't about having his cult followers finally listen to reason. That they will have to do on their own like the Pizza Gate gun man who walked into the DC pizza restaurant armed to save the kids only to realize how bullshit the entire thing was. Resulting in him peacefully giving himself up into police custody. Conspiracy theorist can't be reasoned with they have to come to the conclusion themselves. So even thinking this is even vaugly about changing them is laughably naive at best. Purposefully trying to shift the argument away from what he has actually said and done and the consequences of it at worse.\n\nWhy are you blaming the actions of a single individual on an entire group? How is this any different from the white supremacists you were bitching about earlier taking FBI crime statistics and using that to attack all People of Color as a group?\n\nI'd like to see your answer to that, but it's a rhetorical question, and here's my answer: It isn't.\n\n&gt;Mean while Alex is advocating that liberals should have their jaw broken and he kept full monitazation rights to his videos. Allowing him to make money off it while other smaller content creators that don't pull in the same number of views as him are demonetized for many different reasons. People were literally criticizing youtube for not equally applying their ToS to everyone. Letting Alex Jones go free while punishing smaller channels.\n\nPeople were criticizing YouTube for *censoring free speech at all*, not failing to fight your battles for you by making having different political opinions than you a bannable offense. You are so ignorant and evil that it's not even funny.\n\n&gt;I think it is important to actually know about a topic before commenting on it and your own posts have shown a complete lack of knowledge on all facets of this issue.\n\n\nAgreed.\n\n&gt;Your poorly disguised slippery slope argument is silly. It requires you to assume someone talking about government over spending and someone who is literally racist and advocating violence are the same thing. Not giving a platform, particularly one they can profit from to the worst of the worst of people isn't the same as silencing someone who disagrees with the government. There are degrees of everything in the world. Treating everything as black and white a simple yes or no to me personally is the view of children. Because they are not old enough yet to comprehend the many greys and complexity of the world.\n\nThe actual slippery slope is that the terms of service of Google and other Silicon Valley companies are already **codified into law** in most other countries besides the United States. It might not even be legal for Alex Jones to **run** InfoWars in Canada, or in Germany, or in the United Kingdom. So, really, it's not a slippery slope fallacy at all; we just happen to be all the way at the top of the slope while most of our friends and \"allies\" have been sliding towards rock bottom for years, even decades now. And you expect us to tolerate and not criticize some of the **most powerful multinational corporations that have ever existed** when they take steps that are clearly going to turn us into western Europe if they go unresisted?\n\nFuck, I'm a far-right libertarian, as you're probably already aware of, so just think about how fucked up it is that I need to come to the defend of **literal socialists** and explain to \"liberals\" like you why they have a point. Did you ever consider that like, maybe, if everyone on all sides of the political spectrum is saying \"stop censoring free speech\" at you, maybe you're in the wrong? And we're not all Russian agents or whatever? Just a thought.\n\nAlso, lol @ this: \"Treating everything as black and white a simple yes or no to me personally is the view of children. Because they are not old enough yet to comprehend the many greys and complexity of the world.\"\n\nYour idea of \"recognizing shades of gray\" is dichotomizing other human beings into categories of white supremacist, conspiracy theorist, etc. vs. the \"good guys\" and arguing that anyone who isn't one of the good guys deserves to get their constitutional rights taken away?

After dismissing Maxim Litvinov as Foreign Minister in 1939, Stalin immediately directed incoming Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews\", to appease Hitler and to signal Nazi Germany that the USSR was ready for non-aggression talks.\n\nThe Nazism that arose after the Red Revolution is comparable to the \"antisemitic\" aspects of the post-WW2 USSR because AFTER \"fascism\" fell, Stalin \"somehow\" bought into a \"conspiracy theory\" that Jewish soviets were planning on mass poisoning/assasinating the gentile Soviet leaders to re-fill those elite positions with Jews\n\nHowever, if you go back far enough, [the communism/socialism of the 1800's was ALSO extremely \"antisemitic\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/DebateFascism/comments/9g8e7k/was_karl_marx_an_antisemite_or_jewish_supremacist/), Karl Marx stated:\n\n&gt;\"What is the worldly religion of the Jew?

I think that eventually an Israeli politician will have to do the unpopular thing and negotiate with Hamas just as previous ones did with the PLO, to alleviate the blockade and end the cycles of rocket attacks and reprisal operations.\n\nDo you have an article to backup the sterilization claim I'm familiar with the Haaretz news report from five years ago about the claims that it happened to some Ethiopian Jewish women but if I recall that story was retracted and the investigations didn't turn anything up. As far as the deportation goes plenty of Israelis are ardently against it and worked tirelessly to stop it but the fact is that the right wing coalition is in power and they have the final say.\n\nAs far as the lack of civil marriage in Israel I think it's important to support left wing Israeli movements and organizations as well as the development of Reform and other heterodox Jewish sects so that the issue will be resolved.\n\n I agree there's no such thing as \"the most tolerant country in the world\" but likewise I don't believe that any individual country is the \"most racist country in the world\". In the case of Israeli society there's plenty of willingness to end the conflict and advocate tolerance and plenty of willingness to exacerbate it and advocate racism, making no different from any other country in that regard. My issue as I said in another comment comes from the particular vitriol that many on the left reserve for Israel even outside of the occupation) despite the fact that many (most?) countries tie national identity in some way to ethnicity or religion. I understand when Palestinian or Jewish leftists want to focus on the issue but when it seems to be the only international cause vehemently championed by the vast majority of the left in spite of countless other issues, some fairly similar, it makes me suspicious of underlying motivation.\n\n&gt; I felt fine as an American Jew walking in Beirut\n\nSo did I but it's important to note that I wasn't visibly Jewish in any way. That said when I was in the city there were some things that I noticed including the fact that someone had gone to all the tourism maps in downtown Beirut and scratched off the references to the Magen Avraham synagogue. I also went to a bookstore in Beirut Souks and looked at their religon section. There were tons of books about Islam and Christianity but the only two books I could find about Judaism were Shlomo Sand's *How I Ceased to Be a Jew* and Norman Finkelstein's *The Holocaust Industry*. What does it say that books like that are likely many peoples only exposure to Jewish history or Judaism? Not to mention that I heard some explicity anti-Semitic comments in conversation on a couple of occasions. Cairo is one of my favorite cities in the world but when I told a group of people about my attempt to get into Sha'ar Hashamayim Synagogue by telling the soldiers guarding it that I was an American Jew they all warned me not to go around flaunting that in public because a lot of Egyptians hate Jews. Just as an aside I had a conversation with a cab driver in Aswan, I told him I was Jewish and he became really interested in my religion. He was a really nice guy but one of the things he asked me was \"Did Israel really create ISIS?\". The guy clearly didn't hate Jews and I'm actually Facebook friends with him but it was nonetheless an anecdote that's indicative of the prevalence of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories in much of the Arab world.\n\nPolitically I'm somewhere between liberalism and socialism. I don't consider myself radical because I think that (while no human system on Earth is permanent) the goal of abolishing states and the capitalist economic system and the societies that leftists seek to replace them with are far too Utopian in my view. I also feel that many Jewish leftists in particular have a tendency to over-romanticize the history of Ashkenazi socialism/communism etc. in a number of ways. I'm not saying anyone should be complacent on this issue but you and I probably have fundamentally different visions for how it should be resolved in some important aspects.

The three D's of antisemitism are Demonization, Delegitimization, and Double Standards.\n\nYou're not \"criticising israel\", you're engaging in an astoundingly hypocritical blood libel that's provably untrue on every single level. Take for example the recent gaza riots. Out of tens of thousands of people, enormous numbers of them heavily armed with everything from guns to pipe bombs, &gt;90% of the casualties were officially claimed by Hamas as military combatants or members of other terrorist organizations. \n\nThat's not \"wanton slaughter\", that's a level of restraint and care to avoid civilian casualties no other nation or military on the face of the earth has ever shown in the history of warfare. But it's still not enough for you. Double Standards.\n\nLikewise your blood libel of \"ethnic cleansing\" of an alleged \"native\" population? First off Jews come from Judea and Arabs come from Arabia, and they colonized vast swaths of territory right up until the modern day. This is where there's an enormous wealth of literature about the \"arabization\" of places like Greece. The Jews are according to every shred of historical evidence in existence the indigenous population of the levant.\n\nSecondly why are Arabs under the rule of the PA and Hamas \"palestinians\" but Arabs in the **&gt;80%** of the British Mandate that was made into a state for arabs not \"palestinians\"? Why are Arabs under the rule of the PA and Hamas \"palestinians\" but not Arab citizens of Israel? Why are \"palestinians\" supposedly native to a land that *their own founding charter* explicitly said they have no rights or territorial claims to and belongs to the Hashemites of Jordan as well as Egypt? And most importantly when did the term \"palestinian\", which had been used for centuries right up until WW2 to refer to Jews as \"palestinians\" (such as kant's infamous \"palestinians among us\" essay), suddenly refer to a distinct ethnic group which has no a single shred of documented history prior to the mid-1900s?\n\n\"Ethnic cleansing\" is what happened when every single surrounding Arab state illegally invaded with the explicitly stated goal of genocide, led by a man who literally personally met Adolf Hitler and toured Auschwitz-Birkenau with Himmler before raising Waffen SS divisions to fight for the Third Reich (answering your question as to where the jew hatred comes from), and successfully ethnically cleansed the *actual* native population from the entirety of the territories as well as the century plus old majority jewish population of Jerusalem.\n\n\"ethnic cleansing\" is what happened when virtually the entire jewish population of the entire muslim world was successfully slaughtered or expelled with virtually none remaining to this day. A genocide which has continued, without you giving one solitary fuck, right up until ***last year*** when the [last 50 jews of yemen](https://www.timesofisrael.com/yemeni-minister-says-fate-of-countrys-remaining-jews-unknown/) disappeared. (\"but muwutaboutism!\" you cry. No. That's a silencing tactic, a fallacy. When your entire thesis is claiming the moral highground and how it's not antisemitism because these alleged crimes are so beyond tolerability then your tolerance of them is a direct refutation of your core argument.)\n\nEthnic cleansing is *not* 20% of a country's population being arab muslims who serve at every level of government and military, sitting on the Supreme Court, commanding entire infantry battalions in the military, and having a party in the legislature that operates with such freedom that they are allowed to continue sitting as part of the legislature even when they publicly praise the mass shooting of civilians at a cafe.\n\nNor is \"ethnic cleansing\" a territory's population steadily growing, as well as their life expectancy continuing to rise. In fact by definition if a group's life expectancy and numbers are continuing to grow year over year that is the exact *opposite* of \"ethnic cleansing\" and it cheapens the term for you to abuse it as a casual canard to be thrown at Israel.\n\nTLDR: Thanks for playing but making up outrageous libels about Israel is nothing more than Blood Libel 2.0 and is a millenia old form of antisemitism.

The movement was centered in Salonica.[1] The group originated during and soon after the era of Sabbatai Zevi, a 17th-century Jewish kabbalist who claimed to be the Messiah and eventually converted to Islam in order to escape punishment by the Sultan Mehmed IV. After Zevi's conversion, a number of Jews followed him into Islam and became the D\u00f6nmeh.[2] Since the 20th century, assimilated D\u00f6nmeh might have intermarried with other groups and most have assimilated into Turkish society.\n\n&gt;The D\u00f6nmeh ideology of the 17th century revolved primarily around the Eighteen Precepts, an abridged version of the Ten Commandments in which the admonition against adultery is explained as more of a precautionary measure than a ban, likely included to explain the antinomian sexual activities of the Sabbateans. The additional commandments are concerned with defining the kinds of interactions that may occur between the D\u00f6nmeh and the Jewish and Muslim communities. The most basic of these laws of interaction was to avoid marriage with either Jews or Muslims and to prefer relations within the sect to those outside of it. **In spite of this, they maintained ties with Sabbateans who had not converted and even with Jewish rabbis, who secretly settled disputes within the D\u00f6nmeh concerning Jewish law.**\n\nAnd yet when some non Jew like the islamic Prophet Muhammed encounters self identified Jews with heretical beliefs, like the Ezra was the \"Son of God\", all Jewish authorities just mindlessly assume he made a mistake [because \"we Jews don't believe G-d had a son\"](http://aboutislam.net/counseling/ask-about-islam/jews-call-ezra-son-allah/):\n\n&gt;As regards the belief attributed to the Jews that Ezra (or, in the Arabicized form of this name, `Uzayr) was \u201cGod\u2019s son\u201d, it is to be noted that **almost all classical commentators of the Quran agree in that only the Jews of Arabia, and not all Jews, have been thus accused.**\n\nThere is an absolutely incredible obnoxious confirmation bias in Jewish [\"intelligentsia\" dismissing such observations](https://bloggingtheology.net/2016/07/27/the-quran-the-jews-and-ezra-as-the-son-of-god/):\n\n&gt;So is the Quran wrong in attributing this belief to Jews?  Is it rebutting the belief of a community that never actually held that belief?  How should we understand this?\n\n&gt;An explanation given by Muslim scholars from the time of al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 and al-\u1e6cabar\u012b  (d. 923) was that this belief had, in fact, been held by a group of Jews in Arabia, but that this sect had died out. Ibn \u1e24azm, the famous Andalusian scholar (d. 1064), wrote that there was a group of Jews in Yemen who believed this. (**Interestingly, an inscription from a 4th-6th-century CE Jewish temple in South Arabia suggests possible angel worship**).\n\n&gt;But there does not seem to be any strong evidence that the Jews of western Arabia at the time of the Prophet \ufdfa believed this about Ezra. The problem is that we do not have any external sources (in other words, non-Muslim sources) for what Jews in Arabia believed. As F.E. Peters observed, the Quran is pretty much the only source we have for what Jews believed in seventh-century Arabia.\n\nThe most consistent phenomena regarding objective history surrounding anything possibly Jewish is the insane double standard.\n\nIf there's goyim who observe a Jewish sect with a specific practice/belief (Ezra is the son of god) and there's evidence of that heretical belief (south arabian jewish temples seeming to indicate angel worship of some sort), \"Jewish authorities\" dismiss it all as some sort of \"gentile conspiracy to slander the poor jews\".\n\n", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "DebateAltRight", "date_year_month": "2018-10", "created_utc_converted": "2018-10-23 04:35:33", "score_overall": 26, "words": "jewish jew jew jewish jewish jew jewish jew jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jew jewish jewish jewish jewish goyim jewish jewish jewish conspiracy", "shared_words": "jewish jew goyim conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

French philosopher Patrice Loraux talked about this kind of sophism.\n\nIt's actually called \"looking for evidence of claims\", what I ask is perfectly reasonable. To try and argue that as sophism is pretty much the very definition of sophism. You've claimed that merely asking for evidence is asking for \"ultra-proof\", despite what I'm asking for being the bare minimum to reasonably demonstrate such claims. You've attempted to be clever, but your argument is paper thin, and to be blunt, hugely dishonest. \n\n&gt;It's not aimed at getting the debate going forward, but it is, as it's name suggest, an intimidation tactic aimed at silencing the opposing side through the request of an excruciatingly high burden of proof.\n\nI'm genuinely trying to get a proper debate started, to suggest otherwise is ridiculous. There is no \"high burden of proof\", it's is literally the bare minimum to demonstrate such claims. I'm not asking for 99.95% confidence intervals on a n=100,000 dataset of games from one person, I'm just asking for a clear demonstration of claimed effects, and some attempt at being clear with *some* evidence of other claims. \n\n&gt;This ultra-proof intimidation is a common tactic among some group you are probably familiar with: Holocaust deniers, flat-earthers, moon landing conspiracy theorists, etc.\n\nYour argument is ridiculous. My position is the literal opposite of these groups. I'm looking for solid evidence to base claims, your position is, ironically, the one held by the very groups you name here. Holocaust deniers set ridiculous bars for proving that Jewish people were killed during the Holocaust, or anyone at all. Flat-Earthers demand ridiculous conditions to believe the Earth is round. Moon landing conspiracy theorists are literally asking for more evidence than is possible, despite a wealth of evidence of it happening. This much is true, but the converse is that they build incredibly ad hoc, disconnected arguments, and accept any minimal or unsupported claim as valid, so long as it supports their position.\n\nThe great irony here is that it's actually the scripting side that utilises the tactics of these groups, and has about the same amount of evidence. \n\n&gt;When people discussing with members of those groups come close to giving, or even do give the smoking-gun type of proof that would end any debate, ultimately the goal posts are moved and the ultra-proof intimidation resumes with even higher standards.\n\nI have never once moved the goalposts, they have remained the same. Baffling position you've taken here, a truly anti-scientific, flat-earther style one. \n\n&gt;Meaning a proof that would reveal scripting with a 99.99 % certainty would be dismissed by you on the behalf of the 0.01 % chance that it might be explained by other means.\n\nI'm looking for a signal, any signal. Nobody has ever even tried a rudimentary method of this one here. We're not talking 99.99% certainty here, we're talking having zero pro-scripting evidence, zero at all.

{"archived": false, "author": "HaLoGuY007", "body": "&gt; On Monday, a pipe bomb was sent to the home of George Soros, the liberal billionaire philanthropist whose name has become a part of conspiracy theories around the world. Investigators have concluded that the pipe bomb was probably hand-delivered, and it was \u201cproactively detonated\u201d by a bomb squad without causing injury to anyone at Soros\u2019s home in New York\u2019s Westchester County.\n&gt; \n&gt; Motives for the incident remain unclear. Law enforcement authorities have suggested that the same person who sent the device to Soros was also responsible for pipe bombs later sent to former president Barack Obama, former president Bill Clinton, former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and the CNN bureau in New York.\n&gt; \n&gt; But it\u2019s no surprise that Soros would wind up as a target. He\u2019s become the subject of escalating rhetoric on the right \u2014 including from President Trump \u2014 that posits Soros as a nefarious force, fomenting social dissent and paying members of a migrant \u201ccaravan\u201d that has been the subject of intense right-wing fearmongering leading up to the November midterms. And that rhetoric draws on old, and deep-rooted, anti-Semitic ideas that have been deployed by the right for decades.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Oct. 5, Trump theorized on Twitter that Soros was behind vocal protests against Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment as a Supreme Court justice, stating that \u201cthe very rude elevator screamers\u201d were \u201cpaid for by Soros and others.\u201d More recently, extreme-right Rep. Matt Gaetz pointedly raised the question of whether Soros was paying members of the migrant caravan. More bizarrely, a top lobbyist for Campbell Soup Company was chastened by his patrons for suggesting on Twitter this week that Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation controlled the migrant caravan \u2014 \u201cincluding where they defecate.\u201d (I work at Media Matters for America, which received a $1 million donation from Soros in 2010, eight years before I joined.)\n&gt; \n&gt; The far right has ecstatically embraced the spectacle of elected political figures such as Trump and Gaetz theorizing about Soros. After Trump\u2019s Soros tweet about Kavanaugh, the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer echoed and surpassed Trump\u2019s assertion that anti-Kavanaugh dissent was a nefarious, paid-for plot.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cIt is impossible to deny that subversive anti-American Jews were the primary force involved in a sinister plot to destroy Kavanaugh,\u201d Lee Rogers wrote on the site a couple of days later. \u201cThese Jews do not represent the interest of America. They represent the interest of their diabolical and evil race first and foremost.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; In response to an Oct. 19 Trump speech in Missoula, Mont., in which Trump again suggested that protesters were paid by \u201cSoros or somebody,\u201d a commenter on anonymous message board 4chan exulted, \u201cTRUMP NAMED THE IMMIGRATION JEW.\u201d (\u201cNaming the Jew\u201d is an anti-Semitic term that refers to pointing out purported nefarious Jewish influence on world events.)\n&gt; \n&gt; The conspiracy theories around Soros, then, aren\u2019t just expressions of bitter partisanship \u2014 and fact-checking-focused debunking that\u2019s tempered coverage of the claims that he was involved in the caravan has skipped past an important subtext. Soros\u2019s Jewish heritage is well known \u2014 his experiences in the Holocaust formed his identity as a philanthropist, in a decades-long effort to beat back a revanchist right. And his name has become a synonym for a well-worn anti-Semitic canard: the idea that Jews are malevolent fomenters of social dissent, agitators slyly funding and masterminding protest, seeking to undermine a white, Christian social order. It is a canard that resonates not just in European history, where the deadly consequences of anti-Semitic conspiracies are well-known, but throughout American history, and its renewed form draws on a long tradition of American anti-Semitism.\n&gt; \n&gt; Journalists who post simple, factual rebuttals to anti-Semitic conspiracies ignore their radical potency. The notion that \u201cthe Jew\u201d \u2014 whether it is Soros or a more nebulous conspiracy \u2014 is behind expressions of social discontent serves as an explanation that casts protest as inherently \u201cother,\u201d caused by sinister forces that transcend ideological disagreement or authentic upset, and thus renders opposition inherently illegitimate. These anti-Semitic canards render Jews in America a permanently placeless \u201cother,\u201d perennially out to subvert the country they reside in.\n&gt; \n&gt; The idea that Jews are the malevolent eminence grise behind any upwelling of discontent is hardly new; in fact, it is not even new in the modern United States. Timothy McVeigh, a white nationalist terrorist who killed 168 in the infamous 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, drew much of his ideology from a 1978 white nationalist novel titled \u201cThe Turner Diaries.\u201d The book, which prosecutors claimed helped inspire McVeigh, casts Jews as agents of social dissent in the civil rights era, upending an order in which black Americans had deferred naturally to whites. The book decries \u201cthe unique historical role of the Jews as the ferment of decomposition of races and civilizations\u201d; accuses Jews of plotting to \u201cmanipulate and exploit the entire racial \u2018equality\u2019 movement for their own ends\u201d; and ultimately calls for violence against Jews, stating, \u201cYour day is coming, Jews, your day is coming!\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; While McVeigh\u2019s ideological influences illustrate the potency of anti-Semitism as a political force on the American right, it dates back far longer. Anti-Jewish sentiment rose in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s, egged on by such figures as Henry Ford and radio broadcaster Father Charles Coughlin, who crudely postulated that a communist threat to the United States was being controlled and catalyzed by Jewish agents.\n&gt; \n&gt; But perhaps the greatest rhetorical use of the Jewish \u201cthreat\u201d was made by segregationists in the midcentury South, asserting that the civil rights movement of that era was nothing less than a wholesale Jewish plot to destroy the country.\n&gt; \n&gt; In \u201cThe Rabble Rousers: The American Far Right and the Civil Rights Era,\u201d historian Clive Webb details the degree to which American Jews were blamed for fomenting the desire for social change in the form of racial integration. Webb describes the views of John Kasper, a Ku Klux Klan member and influential segregationist who ran a racist newspaper in the 1950s.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cAccording to Kasper, the individuals, organizations and institutions that promoted racial integration were either Jewish or under the financial and political control of Jews,\u201d Webb writes. \u201cThe NAACP, he insisted, did not represent the opinion of African Americans, most of whom accepted segregation of the natural social order, but rather acted on the instructions of its Jewish paymasters.\u201d A local police officer investigating a 1960 synagogue bombing in Gadsden, Ala., was quoted by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency as stating, \u201cYou Jews brought it on yourselves by encouraging the Negroes to integrate.\u201d Hatred of Jews among racists extended well beyond the height of the Civil Rights movement. Georgia Senate candidate J.B. Stoner ran on a platform of opposition to both black people and Jews in 1972 and decried serpentine, sneaky Jewish influence by calling Jews \u201cvipers of hell.\u201d To a B\u2019nai Brith leader, the 30,000 votes cast for Stoner, who finished fifth in Georgia\u2019s Democratic primary, illustrated \u201chow much raw bigotry still exists in our nation.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Soros has been the target of anti-Semitism more globally, too. In March 2018, far-right Hungarian leader Viktor Orban gave a Jew-baiting speech denouncing Soros and his Open Society Foundations as \u201ccrafty\u201d and someone who \u201cspeculates with money.\u201d Orban said Soros was \u201cnot national but international.\u201d This rhetoric echoed in a speech in which Trump declared that he was a \u201cnationalist,\u201d not a \u201cglobalist\u201d \u2014 delivered on the same day Soros received a mail bomb. The term \u201cglobalist\u201d is frequently utilized as a euphemism for Jew, including by far-right news site Breitbart, which surrounds Jewish Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn\u2019s name with globe emojis, for \u201cglobalist.\u201d The notion of Jews as internationally beholden to some Jewish conspiracy and its goals, rather than serving as loyal subjects of their home countries, dates back at least to a 1920s pamphlet, \u201cThe International Jew,\u201d published by Henry Ford. Nazi-era political cartoons depicted the Jew as an octopus, encircling the world with its many devious tentacles, exerting an irresistible, slimy control.\n&gt; \n&gt; Journalists who cover the contretemps around Soros today \u2014 and in particular, those responsible for providing explanation and context for Republican remarks around him \u2014 must not shy from the anti-Semitism inherent in right-wing attacks on the philanthropist. It\u2019s not even hidden, at least not to the people hearing the dog-whistle: Searching \u201cSoros\u201d on Twitter or Facebook brings up conspiracy theories ranging from the subtly expressed to the downright deranged.

Only after the hyperinflation wreaked havoc and the Great Depression hit shortly afterward, when banks started failing and paramilitary gangs were shooting each other in the street, when Communist Party of Germany entered the parliament... Only then Hitler suddenly was a serious politician. \n\nJews were blamed because Germans were convinced that Jews were secretly supporting Bolsheviks because so many of them were both in KPD and SPD and participated in leftist revolutionary movements. \n\nMein Kampf was a disaster until Hitler won an election and it became a mandatory text. Before then it was selling so poorly that the publisher refused to publish his second book.\n\nHitler was talking about Jews the same way Democrats now are talking about \"white men\". He was not the first and everyone thought he would not be the last. Nobody thought much of it. Germany and World in general at the time was fairly racist by modern day standards.\n\nNurnberg Laws were passed in 1935 - two years after NSDAP took over and a year after Hitler was proclaimed Fuhrer. The laws were intended to repress and not exterminate. They banned intermarriage - something conservative Jews practiced anyway - and removed citizenship which was a bit different then than now. The entire package of legislation including later revisions included Gypsies and Blacks (from German colonies). The laws at the time were something like this transgender law Trump is planning or like the family separation.  It was not putting people into camps - that was being done in secret.  It was either stupid social policy or the right choice for the German people - depending on who was looking at it. But it was not much different than plenty of racist laws in place in say .... the United States.\n\nRemember that?\n\nAbout the pamphlets - the internal campaign of repression in Germany was in Germany where everyone spoke German. Once Germans invaded Poland they did not have to worry.  The selection was not to exclude the unwanted from the general population but to exclude the approved (Volksdeutsche and Reichsdeutsche). You did not have to look for facial features. You asked for the right papers in German and if they did not have it then ...\n\nBut it is the Jews (some, not all) who have interest in making it all about themselves because of Israel and the Nazi-like policies of that state. And this is why Holocaust today is not about history anymore but about politics, the dishonest kind.  And you are repeating their propaganda which always focuses on them but ignores the wider context.\n\nConsider this:\n\nPeople were stunned by the Holocaust. People did not believe the reports from Auschwitz (look up Pilecki). Nobody saw it happening because concentration camps were practices but nobody performed mass extermination of civilians in Europe. \n\nAnd finally Hitler was not a Jew-hater who hated them so much that he wanted to kill them. He was a genocidal maniac who wanted to kill all the \"inferior races\" but had a special dislike of Jews so he put them at the top of his list.  The list was long. Very long. \n", "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "europe", "date_year_month": "2018-10", "created_utc_converted": "2018-10-26 17:42:52", "score_overall": 7, "words": "jewish conspiracy jewish jewish holocaust holocaust jew", "shared_words": "jewish conspiracy holocaust jew", "socre_distint": 4}

{"archived": false, "author": "see_me_shamblin", "body": "&gt;On the evening after the deadliest act of violence against American Jews, President Trump said that Jews had \u201cendured terrible persecution\u201d for centuries: \u201cYou know that. We have all read it. We have studied it.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But his response to the horrific news that a gunman had killed 11 people and wounded six at Shabbat services at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh made it clear that Trump doesn\u2019t actually understand the nature of anti-Semitism at all.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After the shooting, on the airport tarmac on his way to speak to the National FFA Organization, Trump didn\u2019t utter a single word about anti-Semitism. Instead, he resorted to the talking points of the National Rifle Association regarding the need for armed guards in the synagogue, as if an armed guard with a pistol could have been a match for this lunatic armed, yet again, with an AR-15-style assault rifle. (It\u2019s worth noting here that three armed police officers were injured.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A few hours later, Trump did state the obvious: \u201cIt looks definitely like it\u2019s an anti-Semitic crime.\u201d Then he said something that a modestly well-informed president would not say: \u201cThat is something you wouldn\u2019t believe could still be going on.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You \u201cwouldn\u2019t believe\u201d it only if you were clueless about the history and the contemporary reality of hatred for Jews. It is an odd cluelessness for a man who declares himself a great friend of Israel and has three Jewish grandchildren.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After neo-Nazis in Charlottesville last year bellowed \u201cJews will not replace us,\u201d Trump could not find the words to discuss and denounce their anti-Semitism then, either. He famously declared that some of them were \u201cvery fine people.\u201d Yet the president was not alone in finding it difficult to understand or discuss anti-Semitism. The absurdity of the idea that the small numerical minority of Jews in this country either wish to, were trying to or would be able to \u201creplace\u201d anyone drew less attention after the Charlottesville march than the more broadly racist ideology on display there. Discussion of Confederate statues and racism against African Americans fit more easily into the conventional understanding of hate in the United States.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anti-Semitism fosters this perplexity because it is not about skin color and because it is thought to have been dead and buried after the defeat of Nazi Germany. Perhaps that lack of understanding is why executives at Twitter did not shut down the account of the Pittsburgh suspect after he tweeted that he was not going to passively allow the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society to \u201cbring invaders\u201d into this country or \u201cwatch our people get slaughtered.\u201d The man is reported to have said that \u201call Jews must die\u201d when he entered the synagogue Saturday morning.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That insertion of \u201call\u201d is instructive about the conspiratorial mentality that is central to anti-Semitism. It places the shooter in a long tradition of enemies of Judaism and the Jewish people. What has bound and binds these killers together is the conviction that we Jews, though small in number, are a uniquely powerful and evil people. That fusion of power and evil was long embedded in the New Testament story of the death of Jesus, a story told and retold by all the major Christian faiths for almost 2,000 years. It was only in 1965 that the Catholic Church decided that neither the Jews of Jesus\u2019 time nor their descendants were responsible for the death of Christ. Much Jewish blood had flowed before the church arrived at that insight.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The absolute essence, the very core of Nazi anti-Semitism, one blared on the radio and plastered on the front pages of newspapers in Hitler\u2019s Germany, was a secularization of that old religious-based fear. In the anti-Semitic imagination of the Nazis, the Jews became a political actor called \u201cinternational Jewry.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They claimed that Jews, having seized power in the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union, started World War II to exterminate the German people. So, in return, Hitler announced that he was going to defend the Germans by killing Jews in a vast act of self-defense called the Final Solution of the Jewish Question in Europe. Hitler also was aiming at all Jews around the world. The Final Solution was to be global, to crush the powerful and evil conspiracy threatening Germany. That spirit of Nazism was present in Pittsburgh today.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But Hitler\u2019s death did not end other manifestations of anti-Semitism. It lived on in the communist attacks on the conspiracy of Zionists with \u201cAmerican monopoly capitalists,\u201d during the anti-cosmopolitan purges of the early 1950s; in the New Left\u2019s denunciation of a supposedly powerful Israel working as a tool of American imperialism in the aftermath of the Six-Day War of 1967\\*;\\* in the Palestine Liberation Organization\u2019s lies that Israel was an apartheid state that practiced deliberate mass murder. It lived on among the radical Islamists in Tehran, among authors of the Hamas Charter of 1988, and in the al-Qaeda killers who attacked the \u201calliance of Jews and crusaders\u201d on Sept. 11, 2001. That attack fused hatred of the United States and Jews. Every single one of these forms of anti-Semitism, though on opposite ends of the political spectrum, has a conspiratorial mind set at its core that leads to the use of violence to attack the supposedly powerful Jew, indistinguishable from the supposedly evil Zionist.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trump\u2019s contribution to the revival of anti-Semitism in American politics lies in his penchant for conspiracy theories \u2014 evident, for example, in the disgusting closing commercial of his 2016 campaign. It included dark insinuations about global forces, with photos of prominent Jewish figures: George Soros, Lloyd Blankfein and Ruth Bader Ginsberg. That commercial was an unambiguous and obvious appeal to anti-Semitism. If Nazi propagandists had seen it, they might have considered it an update of some of their own posters. Through his support for conspiratorially minded right-wing media figures, Trump has lent legitimacy to a paranoid and dangerous mode of thinking. He has associated it with the presidency of the United States, when it used to be the domain of fringe racists.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The reality is that Jews are a small minority in America and an even smaller one worldwide. And though we in the United States are mostly white, most of us also know that in this overwhelmingly Christian country, we are still an enduring \u201cother.\u201d We know that however sophisticated and tolerant our Christian friends are \u2014 and we cherish our friendships and bonds with them \u2014 that as long as Christians read the New Testament, there will always be some \u2014 however few in number \u2014 who take its words literally and will look upon Judaism and Jews with a mixture of disdain, hatred and fear.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is time for us all, including our political leaders, to spend some time studying where hatred for Jews comes from and how it can and must be defeated \u2014 yet again. The time is long past to end American cluelessness about the history, nature and contemporary danger of anti-Semitism.\n\n*Jeffrey Herf is distinguished university professor of history at the University of Maryland.

The idea that a small group of (largely) Jewish-Americans manipulates Congress, the media and other levers of power and influence for the benefit of a malign Jewish state has no connection to previous anti-Semitic conspiracy theories alleging the same thing.\n\nI believe that when Jeffrey Goldberg called the book\u2019s ideas \u201cawfully close to the Elders of Z\u201d in a devastating review, his views must be treated as suspect.

I believe they were much more influential to the decision-making process than Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell or George W. Bush.\n\nI believe the fact that Wolfowitz, Feith and Perle happen to be Jewish does not, in any sense, make them convenient villains in that drama.\nSign up for Frank Bruni's newsletter\n\nGo beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni\u2019s candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week.\n\nI believe that when left-wing German terrorist Wilfried B\u00f6se insisted, during the 1976 hijacking of an Air France jetliner, \u201cI\u2019m no Nazi!

(It\u2019s worth noting here that three armed police officers were injured.)\n&gt; \n&gt; A few hours later, Trump did state the obvious: \u201cIt looks definitely like it\u2019s an anti-Semitic crime.\u201d Then he said something that a modestly well-informed president would not say: \u201cThat is something you wouldn\u2019t believe could still be going on.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; You \u201cwouldn\u2019t believe\u201d it only if you were clueless about the history and the contemporary reality of hatred for Jews. It is an odd cluelessness for a man who declares himself a great friend of Israel and has three Jewish grandchildren.\n&gt; \n&gt; After neo-Nazis in Charlottesville last year bellowed \u201cJews will not replace us,\u201d Trump could not find the words to discuss and denounce their anti-Semitism then, either. He famously declared that some of them were \u201cvery fine people.\u201d Yet the president was not alone in finding it difficult to understand or discuss anti-Semitism. The absurdity of the idea that the small numerical minority of Jews in this country either wish to, were trying to or would be able to \u201creplace\u201d anyone drew less attention after the Charlottesville march than the more broadly racist ideology on display there. Discussion of Confederate statues and racism against African Americans fit more easily into the conventional understanding of hate in the United States.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anti-Semitism fosters this perplexity because it is not about skin color and because it is thought to have been dead and buried after the defeat of Nazi Germany. Perhaps that lack of understanding is why executives at Twitter did not shut down the account of the Pittsburgh suspect after he tweeted that he was not going to passively allow the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society to \u201cbring invaders\u201d into this country or \u201cwatch our people get slaughtered.\u201d The man is reported to have said that \u201call Jews must die\u201d when he entered the synagogue Saturday morning.\n&gt; \n&gt; That insertion of \u201call\u201d is instructive about the conspiratorial mentality that is central to anti-Semitism. It places the shooter in a long tradition of enemies of Judaism and the Jewish people. What has bound and binds these killers together is the conviction that we Jews, though small in number, are a uniquely powerful and evil people. That fusion of power and evil was long embedded in the New Testament story of the death of Jesus, a story told and retold by all the major Christian faiths for almost 2,000 years. It was only in 1965 that the Catholic Church decided that neither the Jews of Jesus\u2019 time nor their descendants were responsible for the death of Christ. Much Jewish blood had flowed before the church arrived at that insight.\n&gt; \n&gt; The absolute essence, the very core of Nazi anti-Semitism, one blared on the radio and plastered on the front pages of newspapers in Hitler\u2019s Germany, was a secularization of that old religious-based fear. In the anti-Semitic imagination of the Nazis, the Jews became a political actor called \u201cinternational Jewry.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; They claimed that Jews, having seized power in the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union, started World War II to exterminate the German people. So, in return, Hitler announced that he was going to defend the Germans by killing Jews in a vast act of self-defense called the Final Solution of the Jewish Question in Europe. Hitler also was aiming at all Jews around the world. The Final Solution was to be global, to crush the powerful and evil conspiracy threatening Germany. That spirit of Nazism was present in Pittsburgh today.\n&gt; \n&gt; But Hitler\u2019s death did not end other manifestations of anti-Semitism. It lived on in the communist attacks on the conspiracy of Zionists with \u201cAmerican monopoly capitalists,\u201d during the anti-cosmopolitan purges of the early 1950s; in the New Left\u2019s denunciation of a supposedly powerful Israel working as a tool of American imperialism in the aftermath of the Six-Day War of 1967; in the Palestine Liberation Organization\u2019s lies that Israel was an apartheid state that practiced deliberate mass murder. It lived on among the radical Islamists in Tehran, among authors of the Hamas Charter of 1988, and in the al-Qaeda killers who attacked the \u201calliance of Jews and crusaders\u201d on Sept. 11, 2001. That attack fused hatred of the United States and Jews. Every single one of these forms of anti-Semitism, though on opposite ends of the political spectrum, has a conspiratorial mind set at its core that leads to the use of violence to attack the supposedly powerful Jew, indistinguishable from the supposedly evil Zionist.\n&gt; \n&gt; Trump\u2019s contribution to the revival of anti-Semitism in American politics lies in his penchant for conspiracy theories \u2014 evident, for example, in the disgusting closing commercial of his 2016 campaign. It included dark insinuations about global forces, with photos of prominent Jewish figures: George Soros, Lloyd Blankfein and Janet Yellen. That commercial was an unambiguous and obvious appeal to anti-Semitism. If Nazi propagandists had seen it, they might have considered it an update of some of their own posters. Through his support for conspiratorially minded right-wing media figures, Trump has lent legitimacy to a paranoid and dangerous mode of thinking. He has associated it with the presidency of the United States, when it used to be the domain of fringe racists.\n&gt; \n&gt; The reality is that Jews are a small minority in America and an even smaller one worldwide. And though we in the United States are mostly white, most of us also know that in this overwhelmingly Christian country, we are still an enduring \u201cother.\u201d We know that however sophisticated and tolerant our Christian friends are \u2014 and we cherish our friendships and bonds with them \u2014 that as long as Christians read the New Testament, there will always be some \u2014 however few in number \u2014 who take its words literally and will look upon Judaism and Jews with a mixture of disdain, hatred and fear.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is time for us all, including our political leaders, to spend some time studying where hatred for Jews comes from and how it can and must be defeated \u2014 yet again. The time is long past to end American cluelessness about the history, nature and contemporary danger of anti-Semitism.", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Judaism", "date_year_month": "2018-10", "created_utc_converted": "2018-10-29 13:55:05", "score_overall": 11, "words": "jewish holocaust jewish jewish jewish jewish conspiracy conspiracy jew conspiracy jewish", "shared_words": "jewish holocaust conspiracy jew", "socre_distint": 4}

Bannon and other figures of the nationalist \u201calt-right;\u201d hesitated to condemn the rise of anti-Semitic threats and vandalism; issued a Holocaust remembrance statement without mention of Jews; lamented the attempts to silence Alex Jones, who peddles anti-Semitic conspiracy theories; and, declaring himself a \u201cnationalist,\u201d increased verbal attacks on \u201cglobalists,\u201d particularly Soros.\n&gt; \n&gt; Supposedly, American Jews are protected by Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka marrying into the faith, or by Trump\u2019s fondness for Israel\u2019s nationalist policies.\n&gt; \n&gt; But it doesn\u2019t work that way. The ADL reports a 57 percent rise in anti-Semitic incidents in 2017. Other groups Trump targets \u2014 African Americans, Latinos, Muslims \u2014 have long experienced this and worse; a man in Kentucky last week allegedly tried to enter a black church before killing two black people at a supermarket. It is the new normal, though, for Jewish journalists and public figures to endure routine threats, for unabashed anti-Semitism to flourish in social media \u2014 and now for Jews to fear for their safety in quiet places like Pittsburgh, where I lived and worshiped for three years.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whatever Trump\u2019s motives, his words and deeds inspire the hateful and the violent.

{"archived": false, "author": "HaLoGuY007", "body": "&gt; Until recent years, many Jews in America believed that the worst of anti-Semitism was over there, in Europe, a vestige of the old country.\n&gt; \n&gt; American Jews were welcome in universities, country clubs and corporate boards that once excluded their grandparents. They married non-Jews, moved into mixed neighborhoods and by 2000, the first Jew ran for vice president on a major party ticket.\n&gt; \n&gt; So the massacre on Saturday of 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue, by a man who told the police when he surrendered that he \u201cwanted all Jews to die,\u201d was for many a shocking wake-up call.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cThis kind of evil makes me think of the Holocaust and how people can be so cruel, that there is so much evil in the world, still,\u201d said Moshe Taube, 91, a retired cantor from Congregation Beth Shalom in Pittsburgh and a survivor of the Holocaust.\n&gt; \n&gt; But it did not come out of nowhere, said experts in anti-Semitism. At the same time that Jews were feeling unprecedented acceptance in the United States, the climate was growing increasingly hostile, intensifying in the two years since Donald J. Trump was elected president. And it comes at a time when attacks on Jews are on the rise in Europe as well, with frequent anti-Semitic incidents in France and Germany.\n&gt; \n&gt; The hate in the United States came into full view last year as white supremacists marched in Charlottesville, Va., with lines of men carrying torches and chanting, \u201cJews will not replace us.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Swastikas and other anti-Semitic graffiti have been cropping up on synagogues and Jewish homes around the country. Jews online are subjected to vicious slurs and threats. Many synagogues and Jewish day schools have been amping up security measures.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Anti-Defamation League logged a 57 percent rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the United States in 2017, compared to the previous year \u2014 including bomb threats, assaults, vandalism, and anti-Semitic posters and literature found on college campuses.\n&gt; \n&gt; A spokesman for the Anti-Defamation League said that before Saturday\u2019s shooting, the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in recent United States history was in 1985, when a man killed a family of four in Seattle. He had mistakenly thought they were Jewish.\n&gt; \n&gt; There was also an attack by a white supremacist on a Jewish Community Center filled with children in Los Angeles in 1999 that injured five. More recently, in 2014, a white supremacist opened fire outside a Jewish Community Center in a suburb of Kansas City, Mo., killing three people.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m not a Chicken Little who\u2019s always yelling, \u2018It\u2019s worse than it\u2019s ever been!\u2019 But now I think it\u2019s worse than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d said Deborah E. Lipstadt, professor of Holocaust history at Emory University, in Atlanta, and author of an upcoming book on anti-Semitism.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ms. Lipstadt said she did not wish to be seen as alarmist, because in some ways \u201cthings have never been better\u201d for Jews in America.\n&gt; \n&gt; But she likened anti-Semitism to a herpes infection that lies dormant and re-emerges at times of stress. It doesn\u2019t go away, no matter how \u201cacculturated\u201d Jews have become in America, because \u201cit\u2019s a conspiracy theory,\u201d said Ms. Lipstadt, whose win at trial against a Holocaust denier in England was portrayed in the 2016 movie \u201cDenial.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; What has changed, said several experts in interviews, is that conspiracy theories and \u201cdog whistles\u201d that resonate with anti-Semites and white supremacists are being circulated by establishment sources, including the president and members of Congress. Bizarre claims about Jews have moved from the margins to the establishment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Prominent recent examples include unfounded conspiracy theories about George Soros, a wealthy donor to Democratic Party causes, and a Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9 from Hungary who survived the Nazis.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Oct. 5, President Trump asserted on Twitter that the women who stopped Senator Jeff Flake in an elevator to plead with him to vote against advancing the nomination of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court were \u201cpaid for by Soros and others.\u201d In a rally in Missoula, Mont., on Oct. 19, the president told the crowd that the news media prefers to interview protesters who were paid for by \u201cSoros or somebody.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Soros has also been accused of financing the caravan of Hondurans and Guatemalans fleeing north on foot through Mexico \u2014 another claim with no factual basis.\n&gt; \n&gt; A day after a pipe bomb was discovered at Mr. Soros\u2019s home in Westchester, Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, wrote in a tweet, \u201cWe cannot allow Soros, Steyer and Bloomberg to BUY this election! Get out and vote Republican Nov. 6.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Tom Steyer is an Episcopalian and is of Jewish descent. Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, is Jewish. After more explosive devices were found in the homes and offices of other Democratic leaders and supporters, Mr. McCarthy deleted the tweet.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anti-Semitism has also become a charged topic on many American college campuses, with Israel as the detonator.\n&gt; \n&gt; Activists on the left \u2014 sometimes including young Jews \u2014 call for boycotts and divestments from companies doing business in Israel, or the occupied territories. Mainstream Jewish groups are now branding such campaigns as anti-Semitism. Where to draw the line between criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism is a growing source of friction in many colleges and state capitals.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Europe, Jewish leaders have been confronting open hatred toward Jews, also sometimes linked to animosity toward Israel.\n&gt; \n&gt; In France, Jews have increasingly faced attacks and insults from members of the country\u2019s large Muslim community. In March, an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor, Mireille Knoll, was knifed to death in her apartment by a young man who shouted \u201cAllahu akbar.\u201d Prosecutors classified it as an anti-Semitic hate crime.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a 2015 study, 42 percent of French Jews surveyed said that they had suffered insults or aggressive acts at the hands of Muslims.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Germany, anti-Semitism remains a daily occurrence, sometimes taking on the form of criminal attacks on Jews or Jewish institutions in the country, but often in more casual insults or the questioning of the country\u2019s post-World War II commitment to \u201cnever again\u201d repeat the Nazi Holocaust.\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the most prominent anti-Semitic attacks this year, in which a young Syrian struck a man wearing a skullcap on the street of a trendy Berlin neighborhood, led the head of Germany\u2019s main Jewish organization to warn Jews against openly wearing skullcaps, or other public displays of their religion.\n&gt; \n&gt; A demonstration in support of the country\u2019s Jews drew thousands of people to the streets, but months later, in the midst of violent demonstrations by neo-Nazis in the eastern city of Chemnitz, masked assailants threw rocks and bottles at a local Jewish restaurant and shouted anti-Semitic insults, the owner told the police.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nadine Epstein, editor in chief of Moment, an independent Jewish magazine in the United States, said that in 2014 the magazine did a special section on anti-Semitism, interviewing a wide range of scholars and leaders in the field.

{"archived": false, "author": "__Panda___", "body": "&gt;First, using snopes as a source does not lend credibility to your argument.\n\nAs far as I know, they're respected from both sides. And if it would help your argument you'd link to them in a heartbeat. Furthermore they link to the actual video, where your excerpt was taken from in a dishonest fashion.\n\nYou know, you really can't blame the source when they link to original documents, in this case a video. The video shows that what you said is false. So to question the source is majorly dishonest in that situation.\n\nAlso: [Media Bias / Factcheck: Snopes is a Least Biased Source despite what you may have read](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2017/02/26/snopes-is-a-least-biased-source-despite-what-you-may-have-read/)\n\n&gt;With that said, I started off my post with:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I will acknowledge that when people say Soros was an actual Nazi or helped round up Jews, that is bullshit.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I would define that as the \u201cconspiracy\u201d about Soros, (and Shapiro does not claim that as far as I can find).\n\nNo, one conspiracy is **also** that he helped the Nazis, that he was a Nazi Collaborator. Exactly as I stated in my post. This is a conspiracy theory espoused by Shapiro and others. And the Snopes article refutes the \"he was a Nazi\" *and* \"Nazi Collaborator\" conspiracy. It's dishonest of you to simply exclude this conspiracy theory espoused by Shapiro from the list of *real* conspiracy theories surrounding Soros.\n\n&gt;Where things get significantly more complex and ambiguous is how you define \u201chelping the nazis\u201d or what the definition of a collaborator is.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even in the snopes article they acknowledge that Soros worked as an assistant to a Hungarian beaurocrat whose job it was to confiscate Jewish property and had accompanied him at least once (according to Soros himself) in directly confiscating the property of a wealthy Jewish aristocrat named Mor Kornfeld.\n\nHe wasn't his assistant. This bureaucrat was bribed by Soros' father to claim Soros is his Christian godson. Soros took on an assumed identity and  only stayed with him for a few weeks as a boy. At one point he accompanied him when he confiscated property. He didn't help him, he was a spectator. Jesus! His life was in danger. What the hell do you expect him to do? To make loud proclamations how this isn't right and be found out and sent into a concentration camp? I mean that people use that against him is one of the more disgusting things I've heard so far.\n\n&gt;The degree to which one classifies Soros\u2019s actions as being a Nazi collaborator is up to interpretation, but to label it a conspiracy is highly disingenuous.\n\nHe wasn't a Nazi collaborator. Jesus Christ. You have no Idea what you're talking about.\n\nHe was, by the way, fourteen when the war ended and had to hide in that situation and not be found out as Jewish.\n\n&gt;The part of your argument I find particularly objectionable is the classification of the criticism of Soros as \u2018anti-semitic\u2019. To begin with, labelling Ben Shapiro anti-semitic is patently absurd.\n\nFirst of all, it's widely acknowledged that these conspiracy theories around Soros are antisemitic. They obviously are, also the conspiracies of how he funds and stands behind everything, the caravans, everything. Yes, it's antisemitic. And never did I say Shapiro is antisemitic. The *conspiracy theory* is antisemitic. Shapiro espousing it doesn't change anything about that.\n\n&gt;Beyond that, it's becoming more and more common to see those on the left using \u2018antisemitism\u2019 as a shield against ideas that they do not want to argue against. It\u2019s intellectually lazy and weakens the validity of the label. Save the label for real examples of antisemitism.\n\nYes, that's really funny, you really want to claim that's a tactic used by the left? You've got to be kidding me, the left actually does that quite rarely, whereas the right constantly calls the left antisemitic for criticizing Israel. And it's not that I claim that there is no antisemitism on the left. But certainly not as much as it's suggested constantly by the right. So the side that actually constantly uses that label to disregard opinions they don't like is the right. And so for you to say that is majorly hypocritical.\n\nShapiro called Obama antisemitic because he doesn't agree with him on Iran. He called his whole administration a Jew hating administration. He said Obama is \"second holocaust incentivizing\". So please, spare me ... You have no ground to stand on whatsoever.\n\n&gt;Then again, by your logic, is you calling Ben Shapiro anti-semitic, anti-semitic? Makes you think.\n\nI never called Shapiro antisemitic and neither do I think he's antisemitic.\n\n&gt;Finally, Ben did specifically speak to his criticism of Soros on his podcast today. Ben brought up the fact that Soros is, to put it crudely, **Jewish in name only.** This brings up an interesting question, in what way does Soros represent Judaism in any way whatsoever?\n\nI mean, this is just unbelievable. Since the people killed in Pittsburg probably were all Democrats, which Shapiro said in the past are Jews in name only, in Shapiro's eyes there weren't even any *real* Jews killed in this attack. He simply strips away these people's Jewishness. Imagine how he'd react if people did that to Jewish Republicans or to him.\n\nIt's unbelievable that you just follow him down the path of this absurd logic. There is ethnic Judaism. You don't have to believe in a god. You don't have to share Shapiro's exact views on Israel.\n\n&gt;Regardless, I do appreciate the willingness to engage in thoughtful conversation. It's important to examine one's ideas critically.\n\nI can't say that I find your side of the debate thoughtful. It's dishonest and hypocritical I'm afraid to say.", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "benshapiro", "date_year_month": "2018-10", "created_utc_converted": "2018-10-30 04:33:48", "score_overall": 16, "words": "conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy jewish jewish conspiracy jewish conspiracy conspiracy jew holocaust jewish jewish", "shared_words": "conspiracy jewish jew holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}
{"archived": false, "author": "kingsumo_1", "body": "Ok, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt here, and assume you are being honest. But your comment really reads like you think antisemitism is itself a conspiracy not what people believe.\n\nAs for your question, it can actually be traced back to the middle ages, and honestly persecution against the Jewish tribes all the way back into biblical times.\n\n*Most* of it really stems from the christian church. Look up blood libel for more information, but going back to 1144 AD Jews were blamed for killing someone and they created a conspiracy theory that the Jews somehow had a ritual/prophesy that said they had to kill a child each year in order to reclaim their holy land. This, and stories like this spread through continental Europe and lead to a considerable number of pogroms throughout the ages.\n\nI'm going to high level break it down for you though, since this is the essence of of that all the way through WWII and through modern times. \n\nJews are very tribal by nature. In any community they are in, they tend to form their own community within it. Partially for cultural reasons, but also partially because they have been persecuted throughout the ages and they tend to just stick together. As a result, regardless of how tied to any community they are, they are always viewed as different and as outsiders.\n\nThis, of course, becomes kind of a double edged sword. While this is a way for Jews to find and be close to their own kind, as it were. This also makes them the ideal scapegoat for any time a villain is needed.\n\nSo, as a result, any time things go bad, especially economically or in times of political or religious unrest, it is really easy for a \"leader\" to find a common enemy to direct that unrest or anger towards. Usually \"a body\" will be \"found\". There will be stories circulated about it and a couple Jews will be hauled in. There will be confession, often as the result of torture, and then the angry mob will round up and kill any Jews in the area.\n\nSomewhere along the lines, Jews also picked up the stigma of being greedy or money hoarders. Regardless of whether the majority in any given area were actual workers, a lot of money lenders and bankers were Jewish, so the stereotype grew. And with it, stories about how they always carried sacks of gold on them. Or they stole wealth, or had buried treasure somewhere. They kind of became a combo of dragons and pirates or something. I don't know. But racism is racism and it doesn't always make sense.\n\nIn WWII, this was incredibly prevalent. Post WWI they were economically hurting and had a bruised pride. And one of the things that Hitler did was provide the Germans with an enemy within and an enemy without. He used the old go to of the Jews (and the gays, and blacks, and gypsies) as outsiders. He drummed up nationalistic fervor through rallies and helped created a very xenophobic and racist mentality be demonizing \"outsiders\". Sound familiar?\n\nAnd of course, you still see it massively today. Look at some of the more toxic subs and sites on the internet. How often do you see the memes with the \"greedy jew\" with a large nose and rubbing his hands? \"How often do you hear jokes about it? How was the grand canyon formed? A Jew dropped a penny\". These all serve a subtle purpose of dehumanizing them. And why? Because it is much easier to stereotype and profile a group if you think of them as less than human.\n\nNow, I want to end this on a caveat. Like any group of people, Jews should not be excluded from criticism. Being critical is not the same as being antisemitic. And I think Isreal's government is a prime example of that. However, it is incredibly important to not let the criticism of a country's government impact your views on all of the people of that culture. This also applies to Muslims, and really any other group or ethnicity as well. \n", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "politics", "date_year_month": "2018-10", "created_utc_converted": "2018-10-30 21:17:26", "score_overall": 8, "words": "conspiracy jewish libel conspiracy scapegoat jewish jew jew", "shared_words": "conspiracy jewish libel scapegoat jew", "socre_distint": 5}

Pittsburgh has a 5:1 Democrat registration advantage. Tree of Life is a conservative group from what I understand, but Jews in general vote ~80% Democrat. It passes the smell test for me that most would not want Trump visiting them after a massacre for a PR stunt.\n\nTrump has a history of playing coy and retweeting anti-Semites/white supremacists, and of making vaguely racist statements about Jews.
