And they claim that they have the right to do this because they were made into lampshades and soap by Adolf Hitler during World War Two \u2013 that they have to have a racially pure state because they are a uniquely persecuted people. No one can explain why, but people all across the planet are constantly plotting to exterminate them.\n\nBut even though this unique state exists for the uniquely chosen people, they continue to complain that they are having trouble living in Europe.\n\nNote that of the 1,879 alleged incidents, 1,820 did not involve violence.\n\nAlso note that the reason that the 2018 numbers are lower than the 2017 numbers is that the latter included 245 prank phone calls from an Israeli Jew.

(Which makes it intriguing the way frontier-western \"cowboys and Injuns\" pop culture from the US was extremely popular in Germany for decades leading up to the Holocaust, to such an extent that Hitler himself even referred to the targets of the Holocaust as \"redskins\".)\n\nThat said, as a diaspora Jew I do find something unsettling and even anti-Semitic about the modern ideology of Holocaust exceptionalism, especially in relation to the Zionist concept of the \"negation of the diaspora\": this idea that anti-Semitism is some permanent irresistible force of nature, and any attempt to live as a Jew in the diaspora only makes it a matter of time until the goyim decide to do another Holocaust on us (for which one can hardly blame them since it's such a transhistorical force of nature and all) so the only way for us Jews to survive is to all run away to Israel where we can become proper European-style blood-and-soil ethnonationalists, which when you really think about it is the only proper way for human beings to live anyway. On that level I do think drawing a direct connection between Zionism and Nazi anti-Semitism is necessary and important, not because the IDF is literally about to start tossing Palestinians into gas chambers or whatever, but because an important strain of Zionist ideology interprets Nazi anti-Semitic ideology as fundamentally correct about the degeneracy of the Jewish diaspora, and instead of resisting Nazi anti-Semitism, seeks to respond by transforming Jews ourselves into the kinds of people a Nazi anti-Semite might find more agreeable.\n\nThis is also part of why I appreciate so strongly Till's choice of concentration camp badge in the Deutschland video: not just the yellow badge of a Jewish prisoner, which Zionists have since embraced as a symbol, but specifically the red and yellow badge of a Jewish leftist political prisoner, which Zionists generally shy away from since most of the Jews who died wearing it also hated Zionism for exactly the reasons I described.", "score": 0, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Rammstein", "date_year_month": "2019-05", "created_utc_converted": "2019-05-03 15:46:11", "score_overall": 11, "words": "holocaust holocaust holocaust jew holocaust jew goyim holocaust jewish jewish jewish", "shared_words": "holocaust jew goyim jewish", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "summoneren", "body": "You don't have to answer everything, I wrote a shitton. If there is something you feel like you already rebutted properly, just fuck it. I am enjoying the discussion. Trying to learn as much a possible.\n\n&gt;You added some nonsense about power. I was then refuting that part.\n\nWrong. I used the google definition for conspiracy theory, conspiracy and conspire.\n\n&gt;Oh. How official and well read you are. lol\n\nYou don't like that Wikipedia has the same definition as the first google suggestion? Sorry about that.\n\n&gt;Just like using the term dogwhistling.\n\nI sent you the first pop-ups of the definitions, if you don't like them, that's all you.\n\n&gt;Conspiracy theories can one day be proven right like the NSA leaks show. Dogwhistles never can.\n\nWrong. Just because dogwhistling in of itself can't be evidence, there is several ways to give to get to the truth. For example, the person dogwhistling could admit it, purposely or on accident.\n\nNot sure if I should address everything you write here, since I already explained most of it, like:\n\n&gt;No evidence? Then there is no guilt. If there is no evidence of guilt, we presume innocence and that the one laying the charge without evidence is false. Our society has no place for garbage, I mean rapists, like you. ;)\n\nWe use inductive reasoning. We look at patterns and probable outcomes and behaviors. Something can be likely and more likely the more information we gather. If I keep posting pro-ish rapist posts, but never admit I am a rapist. We could still find it highly probable that the likelyhood of me being a rapist is high. Maybe even calling me out or setting me in the spotlight could prevent a rape. I would never support someone calling out dogwhistling without reasonable doubt. But there is indeed cases where it is obvious to one person, whilst the opposition would deny.\n\nFor example. Nick Fuentes denies the amount of Jews getting killed and/or gassed during the holocaust. However, he never stated that. He changed the word Jew with cookies, and the word killed/gasses with baked. Nevertheless, what could we blame him for? The denial of 6 million cookies getting baked?\n\nBtw, new to the reddit-game. How do I link with comments? For example making Nick Fuentes above clickable so I could show the video. Thanks in advance!\n\n&gt;We know there are rapists and pedos in powerful positions but that doesn't mean pizzagate itself is real.\n\nMaybe, this is news to me. Could you give me a source? Genuinely interested.\n\n&gt;No, I don't think you do. As I will show. Because if you did, you would have backpedaled much, much faster.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You mean there was no evidence?\n\nNo reason for me to backpedal an inch.\n\nI discussed inductive reasoning. As we agreed on. We know dogwhistling is a thing. People use it so they won't be held accountable. I cover this in the next part of the response. If someone don't share views, positions or similar talking-points with a Nazi, that person is unlikely to ever use dogwhistling for nazism.\n\n&gt;It has the same probability for a alt-right (that are for white nationalism, Jews not being white in their theology) to contain a Jew, an avid cap wearing Jew. In fact, it is much, much more probable that you are a molester than a cap wearing Jew to be alt right, who hate Jews.\n\nThat's the great thing about america. We have black people, jewish people and other mixes of people admiring white nationalists. Someone like Nick Fuentes, which would not count as a \"white person\" a hundred years ago, consider himself white enough to fight for a white ethnostate that he himself, according to himself, barely would get into. The probability is not about how you look, it's about what you say and what ideas you bring.\n\nYou do agree that a black person can be racist against black people, and a white person can be racist against white people? Like several insane SJWs do.\n\n&gt;Sure you do.And you get yourself in a bit of a quandary here. What is the alt-right? My understanding: evil is the racist white nationalism that identifies as alt-right. They hate jews, like Shapiro. What exactly is the alt-right and what do they believe? Because if you are saying ANY ideas are shared, that is retarded, you are calling all right altright which makes the term useless.\n\nMaybe I do. But you would not know any of them. If you do, come with some examples.\n\nWhat quandary? The alt-right is (in the US) an ideological grouping associated with extreme conservative or reactionary viewpoints, characterized by a rejection of mainstream politics and by the use of online media to disseminate deliberately controversial content. The name itself derived from  american white nationalist Richard B. Spencer's *The Alternative Right,* who was influenced by earlier forms of American white nationalism.\n\nA Jew like Ben Shapiro still could hold at least borderline alt-right beliefs, and his work could reinforce the far-right spot in the US. For ex; normalising talking points.\n\n&gt;Frankly that is what all child molesters say.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In fact, a child molster would want to dilute the term and not type the whole thing. They would want to abriviate it. ;)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And yes this is all absurd. No less absurd than dogwhistling in general. I am just using the dogwhislting nonsense back on you, hopefully so you can reflect with that mirror.\n\nI don't follow your logic, and you seem to know an awful lot about CM. Btw, trying to make my sentences shorter. Sorry about that.\n\nDogwhistling nonsense? Have we not already established that it exists and is a real thing? We both agree that it's a shit thing to do, and it's a shit thing to call someone out for without reasonable doubt, signs or indications. I am saying there is cases where we use inductive reasoning, collect prior signs, information and clues to strengthen that position. Maybe one could stop a person from spreading more hatred and misinformation by calling them out when dogwhistling. Look at the example with Fuentes.\n\n&gt;Just like conspiracy theorists. They all have their patterns, their probable evidence. You are probably a child molester after all it seems. You are disgusting and should be a pariah.\n\nSucks to repeat myself, but most probable is what I have said repeatedly. We gather what we can and try to arrive at the most probable conclusion. Once again, trying to claim that I am a dogwhistler holds no merit, at least in my eyes, as you fail to include or show any prior/current indication of me might being one.\n\n&gt;Define support? Champion the CM cause? Or just talk to them about it?\n\nIf some of my friends were indirectly associated with CM groups, or some of them tried to remove the taboo from the topic etc, and I never tried to stop them or told them it was wrong and even dwelled into hearing their positions on why they don't disavowed it etc.\n\n&gt;Well you do. There are too many fo them accross society for you not to.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You see, you need to attack the disgusting ideas themselves instead of using dogwhistles. Alt-right if you mean the neo-naxi/white supremists/white nationalists are disgusting on the racism the espouse. But I apple that same to black supremacist movement. Both sides are disgusting. There are feminists that have been exposed in PoundMeToo, are all feminists rapists? When disagreeing with a philosophy, instead of telling others they are in it through underhanded and retarded ad hominem arguments like dog whistling, just go after the arguments.\n\n\" But I apple that same standard to BLM as a black supremacist movement\", good. We all should. Though BLM has statistically been peaceful. Google it. But I agree.\n\nI mostly look at these cases as individuals. Not sure if it's ever a good decision to brand large groups as specific things, unless it is a supremacist movement etc, regardless of race ofc. Ad-hom is directed against a person rather than the position they are maintaining. I don't see how dogwhistling would fall under that, but sure.

{"author": "RussianSkunk", "body": "&gt; Oh no! Holy shit!. Scary paths?? Terrifying.\n\nYeah, weeding out who is a \"real Jew\" and who isn't based on their support for a modern state seems pretty fucky. Do I really need to spell out why this isn't an okay thing to do? And for someone who was talking about biological Jewishness a few hours ago, that seems like a weird path to take.\n\n&gt; Not EVERY socialist is, but how are those that aren't different?\n\nSimple, those who aren't embrace their Jewish neighbors and support their right to exist. This doesn't mean they support their right to establish an ethnostate though, particularly at the expense of others who live there. \n\nIf someone opposes zionism but is perfectly accepting of Jews in any other context, then I'm sorry, but I just don't see the opposition stemming from their hatred of Jews. I imagine the core factor at play there must be something else. Is it possible that they were unknowingly influenced by people who do hate Jews, or that they have some unexamined subconscious biases? Certainly. After all, most forms of bigotry aren't as obvious as putting on a white hood or shouting slurs. But I don't think \"they're antisemitic\" is a good enough answer for confronting antizionism as a whole. \n\n&gt; BDS is so notoriously antisemitic - spend a few minutes perusing Canary Mission to see how frequently young BDS leaders (and old) praise Hitler, deny the holocaust, threaten Jews, praise Jew killers, etc etc.\n\nI haven't looked, but I'll take your word for it. Those things are terrible, and I do not support doing them.\n\n&gt;Antisemitism is integral to antizionism. Otherwise why is one always found with the other?\n\nNot always. It's much rarer than the \"kill em all\" types, but I do come across some open antisemites who support zionism because it gets Jewish people out of \"their\" country. Typically these are the \"nice\" ethnic cleansers who just want all the black people to go to Africa, Latinos to Latin America, and so on. This outlook isn't so common though, since they typically believe that there's some vast Jewish conspiracy and simply shipping Jewish folks elsewhere isn't enough.\n\n&gt; just as you can't strip the Judaism out of Israel or Zionism, you can't strip out antisemitism from antizionism\n\nA good test, I think, is to substitute in different ethnic groups and see if anything changes. Is it the right of every ethnic group to have a state of their own? You might say \"Yes, but only in their historic homeland.\" To that, I defer to another comment of yours:\n\n&gt; But if you go far back enough, who IS indigenous. Native Americans? Nope, they crossed the Bering. Swedish ppl? Nope, they were Syrian farmers that immigrated 8,000 years ago. But ppl's are considered indigenous where their whole creation ethos, which every culture has, took place.\n\nI agree with the first part of this statement, but disagree with the conclusion. No group is ever really indigenous to a region. Ethnic groups themselves are a social construct, and one's home is a fluid concept. \n\nAt any rate, I do not support *any* state built around the concepts of ethnicity or religion. White nationalists like to say \"Why is it everyone can have a state except for white people? You wouldn't tell Japan or Uganda that they have to be multicultural.\"\n\nIgnoring the fact that even countries like Japan aren't homogeneous, I would indeed tell those countries that they should to be multicultural. There's a difference between opposing colonialism and opposing integration. I support the concept of Indians overthrowing the Raj, but oppose Hindu nationalists who would deny citizenship to Brits. Similarly, I support the right of Jews to move to Palestine if they please, but using state powers to supplant the locals is a no no. And the idea of Palestinians barring Jews from entering their territory is horrid. So if you want to charge me with destroying all human culture and identity or something (which, ironically, is what white nationalists accuse all those globalist commie Jews of doing), I can roll with that. \n\nPreferably, I would like to see a one state solution in which people of all ethnicities and religions are given the same protections and opportunities. Obviously, that's a total pipe dream considering the animosity in the region. I'm under no pretenses that Palestinians would enter into peaceful coexistence with Israelis if given the opportunity. To be honest, it seems like this is a situation that cannot be unfucked anytime soon. \n\n&gt; I'm not exactly certain that that's my implication- maybe if you were more specific?\n\nImperialism, colonialism, and/or ethno-nationalism.\n\n&gt; Btw were you gonna acknowledge the links I mentioned between socialists like Corbyn and Tlaib and right-wing extremists, or were you just gonna ignore my question?\n\nI don't know enough about either of them to make a strong statement (I'd actually never even heard of Tlaib until now). However, it's hard to trust your judgement call on any of them, considering what your criteria are for concepts like \"antisemitism\", \"right-wing\", or \"Nazi\". I looked up the criticism of Tlaib though and strongly condemn Farrakhan\u2019s comments about Jews. It seems like she still supports him(?) which is no good. Anyone who goes beyond criticizing zionism and attacks Jews as a whole is no comrade of mine. \n\nAt the same time though, heroes don't exist. I've yet to find a single person throughout history who I can unequivocally support. Everyone has something shitty about them that you aren't going to agree with, the challenge is figuring out exactly where you draw the line. You also have to figure out how much guilt by association is too much. Wouldn't it be silly to consider zionists intrinsically linked with terrorism because of attacks by Irgun? Or to call Hitler a Zionist because of the Haavara Agreement? Anyway, this isn't to say that I'm not willing to cancel Corbyn or Tlaib, just that I don't know enough yet to do so.\n\nTo change the subject just a tad, I read a book recently about the US's involvement with the creation of Israel. It's called *Against Our Better Judgement* by Alison Weir. The book made me pretty uncomfortable, as a lot of stuff discussed sounded like conspiracy theories. It makes some pretty extreme claims, and even though literally half of the book is footnotes with thorough sourcing, I understand that sources can be cherry picked or are otherwise unreliable. I'm planning on trying to find some critiques of the book, I was just curious to see if you've heard of it or the author to give me somewhere to start.\n\nEdit:\n\n&gt; As for early Israeli socialists - all the early racism in Israel was all socialists. All the shabby treatment of Mizrahi Jews... The Ethiopian babies... all that done under socialists. You ppl are intrinsically racist.\n\nMan, I wish I would have seen this comment before I bothered writing all this.

{"author": "JeffB1517", "body": "&gt; I was talking about BDS.\n\nThen answered.  I'm not worried at all on BDS' impact on Israel.  Anti-Zionism has a long history of failure with respect to Israel.  Where anti-Zionism has a long history of success however is in destroying domestic Jewish populations and clearing them out of most of the planet.  So I am worried about anti-Zionism being the political cover and arguably motivation for profound antisemitism.  \n\n&gt; They aren\u2019t promoting anti-semitism. At worst they\u2019re promoting anti-Israelism.\n\nRight when left wingers attack Jewish events iit is totally political.  When rightwingers do it even with a stated political objective then it is antisemitism.  You simply make no sense on this issue.\n\n&gt; The source of anti-semitism, particularly in its most violent form, comes from the right-wing. \n\nOnly because you define it that way.  Be objective and that isn't true. ''\n\n&gt;  This is well established. \n\nBy whom?  At this point it is well established among most Jewish groups that the primary source of antisemitism is the left. \n\n&gt;  You should be directing your outrage at people promoting conspiracy theories about George Soros \n\nYou mean totally unlike the left's obsession with Sheldon Adelson and the Mercer's?  Your side doesn't have clean hands their either.  \n\n&gt; Source?\n\nShe's on the foreign relations committee.  Saudi Arabia has come up multiple times.  She has no problem speaking when she wants to diverge from USA policy on a host of issues.\n\n&gt;  No one within the movement interprets it as calling for extermination or enslavement. \n\nThey don't use those words.  They do however create apologetics for genocide.  They argue passionately for racial genocide and then claim to just be a human rights group.  If you want to argue that \"colonizer\" is passed on by birth then it is racial.  If you want to argue that \"colonizers\" are illegitimate inhabitants then you are arguing for genetic evil.  It is nonsense to pretend that a theory of racial evil is anything other than what it is.  BDS rhetoric implemented is genocide.  \n\nNow if you want to argue that BDSers are genuinely too stupid to identify their rhetoric as genocidal I'd partially agree.  I also think a lot of that comes from moral cowardice and dishonesty.  Let's take a good sample:\n\n*You guys are in invadeders in Palestine. The thing that must be eliminated is precisely \u201cIsraeli patriotism\u201d, if you want to rename Zionism. ... An illegitimate \u201cfoundation\u201d on other people\u2019s land invaded by millions and millions of unauthorized intruders, come to plant a colony and make indignant noises when their offspring, like your good self, are reminded that colonization is not erased by the magic of being born there. Sorry bud, you\u2019re not a local unless explicitly recognized by the collective of all Palestinians. Who authorized the invader to assume as a given an \u201cequality\u201d with the invadee who owns the country and the sovereignty on it?*\n\n&gt;  There isn\u2019t a universal agreement about how to apply BDS. Folks within the movement disagree.\n\nYes and they disagree in both directions.  The Muslim kids who murder Jews in France have one interpretation.  The simply boycotters have another.  If all interpretations are equally valid then BDS is equally both.  If on the other hand we want to argue that the kids in France are not part of BDS then there are BDS committees which set standards.  And those standards become the agreed upon minimum of what BDS advocates.  \n\n&gt; , I\u2019m sure this stance of \u201cWell you can\u2019t blame anti-semitism for the mass murder of Jews in the US because we\u2019re just a sick country\u201d will change the second any link to BDS is discovered. \n\nBDS are layers of well organized groups.  The proper comparison to BDS is something like violence from the Albanian Mafia not individual lone wolf mentally disturbed shooters.  BTW there have been many anti-Zionists synagogue attacks like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Jerusalem_synagogue_attack and BDS did not get the blame.  \n\n&gt; You could just as easily say morally pro-Israel people have no problem with murdering someone like Ilhan Omar. \n\nIlhan Omar is your obsession.  Pro-Israel people (AIPAC, AJC...) are handling her the same way they regularly handle anti-Jewish congresspeople for decades.  She is going to face well funded primary opponents every two years for a few cycles to drive up her negatives and she loses the general or primary within a decade.  She is not the first Jew baiter in congress the Jewish community has had to deal with and with BDS won't be the last. \n\n&gt;  you\u2019ve promoted the same deranged conspiracies about Rep. Omar as the president\n\nWhat conspiracy have I promoted about her?  \n\n&gt; Who did you vote for btw?\n\nHillary voted and donated.  \n\n&gt; Would you be surprised if someone saw you say that, took it to heart, and then to it\u2019s logical conclusion that something should \u201cdone\u201d about these wicked and evil people?\n\nYou have got to be kidding me!  You argue the rhetoric of BDSers has 0 impact and then say that the anti-BDS rhetoric is a threat.  \n\nYes I would be surprised.  But if someone does take the rhetoric that way maybe they will learn to moderate their rhetoric and cut the extremism out.  That words can lay the groundwork for policy.  That they should be carefully measuring their words and tone appropriately.  But I'm having a hard time given your rhetoric even in this post taking your concern about it seriously.  \n\nThere could be a civil and reasonable dialogue regarding I/P.  Were it not for anti-Zionism the problem of Israel could be handled much like Catalonia or Quebec.  The primary reason people are getting killed in such vast numbers in the I/P conflict is Palestinians expect the world to intervene and reverse the historical outcome if they can just keep themselves on the agenda. So rather than dealing with the actual government that exists they keep trying to dialogue with marginal players who make promises they can't deliver on.  \n\nThat nonsense was stopped 20 years ago.  Between the left and right there was a reasonable discussion of the I/P 20 years ago.  Palestine Solidarity, BDS's predecessor, destroyed that by demonizing Israel and reintroducing   UN 3379 style rhetoric back into the discourse.  But there is no Soviet Union anymore.  There is no country which can even plausibly claim to be willing to go to war for Palestine accept Iran and they clearly don't have the power to deliver.\n\nThe people who choose to escalate the rhetoric in the USA is the left.  The right gets none of the blame. \n\n&gt; The right wing has a history of this.\n\nStalin, Pol Pot, Mao, Kim Il-sung / Jong\u2011il, Ranavalona...

{"author": "nulom", "body": "\"Anti-Semitism\" as a Political Weapon\nBy Lasse Wilhelmson\n \n  \t\nCriticising Israel\u00b4s mistakes is acceptable. But questioning whether Israel is a Jewish state with a racist apartheid system that renders non-Jews second rate citizens - that is not acceptable. It makes little difference whether the criticism is based on facts. Few people who cannot claim Jewish descent would dare to criticize publicly. They are afraid of being accused of \"anti-semitism\".\n\nThere is much talk of disarming countries with nuclear weapons. Not the US and its allies, but the so-called 'rogue states', especially Iran, which doesn\u00b4t yet have any weapons. Israel is hardly ever mentioned as a nuclear power although it has been for a long time. In spite of its advanced plans to bomb Iran, Israel is not seen as a threat to the surrounding world. The media regularly criticizes severely various religions, especially Islam, but never Judaism. Catholic pressure through lobbying, or the Pope\u00b4s speeches on political issues are discussed and criticized. The fight in South Africa against the Boers involved a whole world. Not because they were a \"race\" with undesirable characteristics, but because they were the social group who in their own interests formed and administrated a racist apartheid system. The same sort of criticism was aimed at the followers of Cecil Rhodes in Rhodesia.\n\nAll types of social, ethnic and religious groups defend their own special interests. It is considered quite legitimate for their spokesmen to do their best to promote these interests; just as it is quite legitimate to criticize the same. But the moment Jewish spokesmen and their organisations are criticised, the legitimacy vanishes into thin air. The mention of \"Jewish power\" makes most people\u00b4s blood run cold, but it is quite alright to discuss \"gypsy power\" or rather the lack of it. \"Jewishness\" has become taboo. This applies particularly to the combination of \"Jewish\" and of \"power\" . All kinds of power can be examined and discussed, questioned or rejected - but not the Jewish kind which is generally presented as non-existent.\n\nThere is growing anxiety in the Palestinian movement in Sweden about using \"Jewish\" as a prefix to the settlements, the state of Israel or the apartheid system, albeit the use is quite correct. The settlements for example are \"Jewish settlements\" simply because only Jews are allowed to live there. They are not Israeli because non-Jewish citizens are forbidden access to them. Neither are they Zionist as many Zionists are not Jews. It has now got to the stage where a leading spokesmen for the Palestinians in Sweden denies that Jews and Palestinians have disagreements, despite the law giving Jews all over the world the right to return to Israel, thus making them potential enemies of the Palestinians. Having a Jewish mother gives the right to live in the country taken from the Palestinians. One would be hard put to find a more fundamental disagreement. The issue of blood-relationship renders it, moreover, racist.\n\nA reluctance to discuss Judaism\u00b4s significance for Zionism in Israel of today makes it impossible to understand why Israel was not content with fifty per cent, later eighty per cent, of Palestine. Or why a social democratic prime minister ordered his soldiers to break the bones of children throwing stones? And how can one understand why Jews in Jerusalem throw their garbage onto the roads and back yards of their Palestinian neighbours, spit at them, or why masked Jewish settlers during the \"cease fire\" launched pogroms on unarmed Palestinian farmers, women and children? Or why the Israeli \"peace movement\" and \"left\" do not question the Jewish apartheid system? Just and lasting peace can never be achieved without its transformation. Few people think that all this is a result of the Jews being an \"evil race\". But if it cannot be explained by any other means, the few risk becoming too many. A racially-based hate of Jews is helped along by the label of \"anti-semitism\" pasted on nearly all criticism of Israel, not to mention criticism of Judaism.\n\nZionism, through its Jewish organisations, is the dominant interpretation of Judaism today. This is a renaissance of national Judaism of the Middle Ages and the judicial system Halakha with its extreme animosity towards non-jews who were seen rather as subhuman. This revival is seen as very beneficial by most Jewish organisations worldwide. They demand of their members positive commitment to the state of Israel. This is the context in which the behaviour mentioned above can be understood. Most Jews in the diaspora are, however, \"happily\" unaware of this and are being used by their Zionist leaders and rabbis.\n\nPolitics and religion have merged in the state of Israel today. A person speaking out for a secular democracy to replace the Jewish state, is accused of, in fact, wanting to \"drive the Jews into the sea\". Most Jews today identify themselves not with Israel but with Israel as a Jewish state. This creates a fundamental contradiction for many Jews: supporting the Jewish apartheid state while promoting democracy in the countries where they actually live. Denying or whitewashing Israel\u00b4s politics, becomes a way of keeping one\u00b4s identity intact. Violent, groundless attacks with \"anti-semitism\" as a weapon is the method used against any attempt to lay bare this contradiction. A well known example is how Israel\u00b4s former ambassador to Sweden vandalised the art installation Snow White last year.\n\nThe risk of being labelled \"anti-semitic\" if you are not a Jew or of \"self-hatred\" if you are, creates self-censorship among those who are critical of Israel\u00b4s policies or dislike the successful lobbying carried out by Jewish and Christian Zionists, influencing US foreign policy. The so- called Friends of Israel, most of them spokesmen for Jewish organisations, have taken it upon themselves to be the foremost interpreters of the term \"anti-semitism\". Few question this role as they run the risk of being tainted themselves if they do. The term \"anti-semitism\" is taking on new nuances all the time. Of late the slightest implication, as in \"almost anti-semitic\" or an \"anti-semitic point of interest\" has been enough to invoke self-censorship. The mention of these circumstances is often felt to be \"dangerous\" as it could lead to the growth of \"anti-semitism\". All this in a western world where islamophobia is a considerably greater problem.\n\nJews are rightly proud of their success in almost all corners of society. In art and science and, not least, the media and politics. Israeli newspapers tell of the successful \"likudification\" of the Bush administration and delight in the fact that the Israeli minister for the diaspora is Bush\u00b4s new favourite author and pet in the White House. Russian oligarchs with Israeli citizenship take breakfast there. There is a culture of boasting about this among Jews. But should a critic of Israel point to these exact same circumstances, he would immediately be accused of spreading \"anti-semite theories of conspiracy\" and thus be barred from any further discussion.\n\nThe Jews have for many years had total entrepreneurship of \"God\u00b4s chosen People\" with a \"biblical right\" to Palestine. Zionism has been politically successful in reducing the Holocaust to Nazi war crimes against Jews. By presenting themselves as the major (the only?) victims in the history of humanity they expect to claim special moral rights. The method is used favourably to justify and cover up the genocide of the Palestinians. \"Anti-semitism\" is being used to stop criticism of Israel\u00b4s way onwards to achieve the Zionist goal of a Jewish state in the whole of Palestine. Before this goal can be realised, \"peace\" must be reached with the creation of a few Palestinian reservations on ten per cent of what was originally Palestine, walled-in and gradually wasting away. We are almost there now.\n\n*****\nLasse Wilhelmson was born in 1941 in Sweden. Part of Wilhelmson's family fled to Sweden from the Czar's pogroms during the 1880s.

{"author": "[deleted]", "body": "I don't know if I'd say *Racial* hatred is 2000 years old. Early anti-jew attitudes were primarily driven by religion.\n\nIt wasn't until the 1800s, racial hygiene, and radical social changes did anti-semitism primarily become racial in nature.\n\nFor example, from the book suspicious minds:\n\n&gt; Superstition and prejudice toward Jews dates back to the earliest years of Christianity. Saint John Chrysostom, a fourth-century preacher widely admired for his eloquence, eloquently denounced Jews as baby-killing devil worshipers. In 1215, Pope Innocent III was concerned that Christians might find themselves unwittingly having relations with Jews. His solution was to make Jews wear distinguishing clothing, leading to the yellow \u201cbadge of shame\u201d that many Jewish people around Europe were required to wear throughout the Dark Ages\u2014and again under the Nazis. A couple of decades later, Pope Gregory IX established the Inquisition, a formalized effort to prosecute heresy against the Roman Catholic Church, which eventually led to mass executions of Jews, among other accused heretics, and mass burnings of their holy books.\n\n&gt; According to the pious logic of some medieval theologians, the Jewish Talmud was both blasphemous and, paradoxically, a testament to the truth of Christian teaching. Just as the Devil knows the truth of Christianity but is determined to deny it and destroy those who believe it, so too, Christian scholars argued, do the Jews. People came to see Jews as being in league with Satan, possessing arcane knowledge and black magic, and harboring an unquenchable hatred for Christianity. Allegations that Jewish people were plotting against Christians became commonplace.\n\n&gt; One popular theory had it that Jews were in the habit of poisoning Christian drinking wells. When the Black Plague ravaged fourteenth-century Europe, outbreaks were often blamed on the international Jewish well-poisoning conspiracy. In some cases, torturers coerced confessions from a handful of Jewish suspects, on the basis of which thousands more were burned alive. The worst of the pogroms was in Strasbourg. Fear-stricken locals, desperate to prevent the plague from reaching them, decided to preemptively slaughter the town\u2019s Jews. (Some of the town\u2019s nobility were also in debt to Jewish money-lenders, and may have seen an opportunity to clear their tab.) City authorities attempted to intervene but couldn\u2019t hold the mob at bay. All told, around nine hundred Jewish people were burned alive, and the rest were baptized or banished. The plague soon swept through town regardless, leaving sixteen thousand people dead in its wake.\n\n&gt; There was also the \u201cblood libel\u201d\u2014the allegation that Jewish people routinely murder Christians and drain them of their blood, which they allegedly used to make the Passover meal, to make medicine to heal their physical defects, or to perform unholy rituals. The myth was invented in the twelfth century, when a young Christian boy was found dead on the outskirts of Norwich, England, the day before Easter Sunday. Thomas of Monmouth, a Benedictine monk turned amateur detective, offered a convoluted explanation. Jewish teaching, he claimed, asserts that Jews must spill Christian blood in order to regain their homeland. Thus, a secret council of Jewish elites convenes once a year to select a sacrificial Christian child. Monmouth\u2019s idea caught on. For centuries thereafter, whenever a Christian child went missing or turned up dead, local Jews were often the first suspects.\n\n&gt; These religiously motivated fears circulated for centuries. Meanwhile, Jews in many regions were denied citizenship and property rights, confined to ghettos, or banished from Christian society altogether. This began to change in the wake of the French Revolution, when many Jewish people were granted basic human rights and began to emerge from isolation. They naturally tended to favor liberal and democratic political policies that represented their best hope of increasing liberty. Still sidelined from traditional occupations, many migrated to the cities and pioneered inventive new ways of making a living. While most remained impoverished and out of sight, a few became extremely wealthy.\n\n&gt; This all led to new social tensions. A lot of people weren\u2019t thrilled about the radical changes taking place around them. For some, the newly integrated Jews became a defining symbol of the modern world. The age-old prejudice that had given rise to the blood libel and well-poisoning myths was reinvigorated and updated to reflect modern anxieties and resentments. Jews were no longer enemies of God, but enemies of man. In 1879, a new word, antisemitism, was coined to reflect the fact that what was once a collection of primitive medieval superstitions had become a fully-fledged political ideology.", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "philosophy", "date_year_month": "2019-05", "created_utc_converted": "2019-05-10 00:43:10", "score_overall": 15, "words": "jew jewish jewish jewish jewish conspiracy jewish jewish jewish libel jewish jewish jewish jewish libel", "shared_words": "jew jewish conspiracy libel", "socre_distint": 4}

Michael Jones is an anti-Semitic Catholic writer who promotes the view that Jews are dedicated to propagating and perpetrating attacks on the Catholic Church and moral standards, social stability, and political order throughout the world. He portrays the Jewish religion as inherently treacherous and belligerent towards Christianity. He describes Jews as \u201coutlaws and subversives [who use] religion as a cover for social revolution,\u201d and claims that Judaism possesses \u201ca particularly malignant spirit.\u201d Jones also imagines the contemporary world, with its social ills, as having been cast in the imprint of Judaism, characterizing 21st-century civilization as \u201ca Jewish world run on commercial principles.\u201d He also identifies this \u201cJewish modernity\u201d as representing \u201cblood, the law, calculation, and hate.\u201d In the tradition of conspiracy theorists, Jones credits Jews with orchestrating occurrences as varied and disconnected from the Jewish experience as the Protestant Reformation and the French Revolution. He also blames Jews for Bolshevism, Freemasonry, and an alleged contemporary \u201cJewish takeover of American culture.\u201d Jones reaches for tenuous connections to paint \u201cthe Jews\u201d as inherently wicked and prone to colluding openly or secretly to threaten other populations around them. Jones argues that mass killings of Jews throughout history have been understandable reactions to Jewish beliefs and behavior. He goes so far as to justify Eastern European pogroms and even the Nazi Holocaust on these grounds. As he wrote in a 2003 Culture Wars article, \u201c[T]he Nazi attempt to exterminate the Jews was a reaction to Jewish Messianism (in the form of Bolshevism) every bit as much as the Chmielnicki pogroms flowed from the excesses of the Jewish tax farmers in the Ukraine.\u201d    \n    \nMaybe you'll get all mad and whiny if I call you a Nazi because bla bla bla libtard snowflakes bla, but you're a Nazi, my dude.

We don't talk about that anymore because it was superceded by the nuke and biochemical warfare as an advanced science.

They disprove Trump's lies including immigrants flooding the border (they're not), that they bring crime (they don't), and that they're a drain on the economy (they aren't).^[[2]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/21/theres-no-immigration-crisis-and-these-charts-prove-it/?utm_term=.5a93c2cb02fa)\n\n&gt;The administration has said that the country is in danger of being \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by \u201cmassive increases in illegal crossings\u201d that will bring \u201chorrible crime,\u201d \u201cunbelievably great taxpayer expense\u201d and the loss of American jobs.\n\n&gt;None of those claims are true.\n\n&gt;...Here's what we can say in conclusion. Current rates of illegal immigration remain extremely low by historic standards. Legal and undocumented immigrants are significantly less likely to commit most crimes than native-born citizens, making them a net benefit to public safety. The research shows that immigrants are not taking jobs away from U.S. natives, and their impact on wages appears to be small to nonexistent, particularly across the long term.\n\n**President Trump's rhetoric is incredibly dangerous and is reminiscent of authoritarian leaders who have committed crimes against humanity.**\n\nThe President's rhetoric - his referral to undocumented immigrants as *\"infesting\"* the United States is incredibly dangerous and it is not the first time he has alluded to white nationalist talking points.

{"author": "MarioThePumer", "body": "The rampant racism in this thread is astonishing.\n\nAnd before you ask \u201cwell, why *were* they kicked out so often?\u201d let\u2019s start from the beginning. The first few times jews were kicked out were due to religious hatred, as Jews were blamed for killing Jesus. After a few centuries (and a major change in how Christians viewed Jews in regards to Jesus\u2019s death) said hatred settled down, but the Jewish life was already majorly changed. Since Jews were kicked out left and right, (and somewhat due to religious beliefs,) they learnt to not work the land they live in, leading them to work primarily in non-farming related jobs. Additionally, since they had  to learn a new language in every country they settled in, they became multilingual, which was very useful for merchant-work.\n\nThis is where the \u201cgreedy Jew\u201d stereotype originally comes from - many Jews worked in trading due to their multilingualism, and while that stereotype was only accurate in the.. let\u2019s say, 16th century, people often needed a scapegoat for their issues. Herein come blood libels and antisemitism, which were rampant in Europe since the 1500s, and really reached their peak in the 1910-1940s.\n\nTL;DR - Jews were first kicked out for killing Jesus, and then were kicked out because everyone already hated them (for killing Jesus) and so were an easy scapegoat.", "score": 21, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "HistoryMemes", "date_year_month": "2019-05", "created_utc_converted": "2019-05-15 11:20:30", "score_overall": 5, "words": "jewish merchant jew scapegoat scapegoat", "shared_words": "jewish merchant jew scapegoat", "socre_distint": 4}
{"author": "Rabsus", "body": "You can write volumes and volumes on this topic, it incorporates thousands and thousands of years of cultural and religious history.  I don't really study theological history but I can give a very brief overview.  Every single instance of persecution of Jewish can have an entire book written on it.\n\nJewish communities have long since been rather insular, you can see this culturally and in scripture.  They've long since inhabited a historically contentious area of history alongside faiths that vary in their attitudes towards them, either politically or religiously (Islam or Christianity). A good overview of how Jews have been historically viewed would be through Qur'anic or Biblical criticisms on Jews. \n\nFor instance, Jewish law did not forbid usury which was outlawed in these other Abrahamic religions which allowed Jewish populations to dominate financial aspects of heavily religious societies, because a lack of competition.  Another aspect is the \"christ killer\" and sense of betrayal that compounds with this whole \"secret control of finances\" conspiracy that uses religious dogma to incite popular connotions of betrayal, duplicity, and greed.  Conspiracies arise from these connotations and a cycle of persecution persists, hygenic habits of Jews along with isolated communities mean they are less liable to be hit by plagues as local communities are, fueling conspiracy theories that are in turn fueled by these conceptions. Jews poisioning wells to kill Christendom sounds archaic and crazy, right?  Well its no coincidence that this argument made back in the middle ages to massacre groups of Jews is fundamentally the same argument that was used in WW2 and that was used today.  Anti-semites will have you think these are all independent events as populations \"learned the truth\" but under close scrutiny it is obvious that there exists a popular overarching theme and commonality between the persecution and *who* is doing it.\n\nIn the Islamic world you have a similarly tense relationship with Judaism.  Common Qur'anic verses include themes such as distorting and corrupting God's will (Islam believes Jews and Christians received divine words, but corrupted them), breaking the covenant (duplicity, greed, lack of conviction, cowardly), ridiculing Muslims, among many other criticisms that were very prevalent in theology at the time.  At the same time however, the Qur'an and Bible have similarly relatively \"complimentary\" passages on Judaism, so its a mixed bag here.  Judaism is also the smallest of all the Abrahamic religions which is worth noting, over half of the world is following an Abrahamic religion while Jews are .2% of the world's population.  Making them easy targets for persecution that has historically been fueled on religious grounds. Think about how many times Muslims and Christians have quarreled and continue to do so to present day, Judaism is part of that fold and is integral to the doctrine and cultural development of both religions.\n\nThese stereotypes stick around **a very long time**, which is why anti-semites try to phrase the \"109 countries\" thing as if they are all isolated incidents, which they are not even close to being and the \"kicking out\" varies heavily in scope and context but are portrayed to be a universal constant following a simple rule.  Kicking out could be reduced to even just a few thousand being forced out by occupational forces of a small country, putting this country on par with something like Russia or the United States, much less random medieval fiefdoms or whatever.  Anti-semitism is by design marketed in reductionist tactics, because fear mongering works best when you break things down to reduced and inaccurate terms. Even so being run out of somewhere isn't indicitive of anything, African-Americans have probably been run out of every single US state since the inception of the United States.  Native Americans have as well, though it would be stupid to say that \"Native Americans have been run out of everywhere in the United States, coincidence?\" without examining the historical picture.\n\nAs for the whole \"109 countries\" thing, there is a reason why anti-semities will ask a rhetorical quesiton and not answer it.  Because its more convincing for them not to, it leaves you to stew on these \"questions\" without them having to defend their views.  Its the same reason they will often be ambiguous about holocaust denial views, often using memes or phrasing questions in a certain light to arise suspicion so they can dash off somewhere else. This is why you always see the common \"I'm just asking questions, is that illegal?\" type rhetoric coming from these communities to fuel the narrative of ideas being \"supressed\" and the concept of \"brainwashing\".  It is all very deliberately planned rhetoric in the way this information is laid out to people.\n \nAnti-semites also prey on the inherent Western centric views of their audience.  Acting as if Judaism has faced widespread persecution whereever it has gone.  China accepted many Jewish refugees (Seriously, and the founding father of modern China, Sun Yat Sen, likened Jewish persecution with the humiliation of China by the West) and you see little persecution of Jews in areas outside of Western Christian/Islamic influence, possibly because these long grained stereotypes and scapegoating doesn't exist in large quantities there.", "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "HistoryMemes", "date_year_month": "2019-05", "created_utc_converted": "2019-05-15 11:47:09", "score_overall": 11, "words": "jewish jewish jewish jewish conspiracy greed conspiracy greed holocaust jewish jewish", "shared_words": "jewish conspiracy greed holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}
{"author": "nidarus", "body": "&gt;If he was not a Nazi then he'd be persecuted like everyone else. Ethnic Jews that fought with Germany during the WWI were granted immunity as were Jews who fought with the Nazis.\n\nSimply not true. According to the [Nuremberg Laws](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Nurembergracechart.jpg), Judaism only extended to the grandparents. Someone with merely a Jewish great-grandfather wouldn't even be considered a Mischling (mixed Jew-Aryans, who were allowed to serve in the Nazi army), but a full Aryan. Again, even freaking Hitler thought this guy's heritage was sufficiently Aryan. But I guess not you.\n\n&gt;I think you don't understand the difference between ethnicity and nationality. There were (and still are) many ethnic Germans in Poland with a Polish name (ski, cki,etc) Due to centuries of mixes marriages a lot of surnames were passed on through generations. But calling them Polish is like calling a German with a Jewish sounding surname Jewish.\n\nI mean... you literally just called someone with a single Jewish great-grandfather \"Jewish\". Someone who's neither ethnically, religious nor nationally \"Jewish\", nor had a Jewish last name. I'd say considering actual ethnic Poles as part of the \"ethnic Poles\" (your qualification, not mine) who supposedly served in far lesser numbers in the SS than Jews, is more than justified.\n\n&gt;And like you said. The Poles working in Camps were forced into it. The Jews working in ghettos were being paid and they gladly handed over the names and addresses of other Jews (as well as Poles.)\n\nYeah, I'd really like to see evidence of that. As far as I know, there were both collaborators, and forced workers on both sides.\n\nI'm still waiting for the evidence for how \"fare more Jews serving in the SS than ethnic Poles\".\n\n&gt;And the last part is just denial. Even your Prime Minister defended Hitler and said that not the Germans but the Arabs wanted to kill all the Jews. In my book that's Holocaust denial.\n\nIt's thoroughly documented, mainstream history. You're more than free to look it up in Wikipedia - if you don't considered a tainted Jew-source of course.\n\nAs for Netanyahu, what he said is fucked up, but it's not that \"the Germans didn't want to kill the Jews\". He was repeating a fringe theory that the Mufti of Jerusalem, an avid fan and participant of the holocaust, was the one who brought up the idea of killing the Jews, back when Hitler was merely considering the Madagascar \"solution\". And he was lambasted by the entire Israeli society, including Yad Vashem. But I'm not sure how it's even remotely related to anything I said.\n\nEither way, I do find it particularly amusing to see someone who tries to prove the Jews fully collaborated with holocaust, participated in SS in great numbers, and did so out of greed, complaining about \"holocaust denial\".", "score": 14, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "worldnews", "date_year_month": "2019-05", "created_utc_converted": "2019-05-15 17:17:27", "score_overall": 14, "words": "jewish jew jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish holocaust jew holocaust holocaust greed holocaust", "shared_words": "jewish jew holocaust greed", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "skykingdarel", "body": "Sorry started writing and got carried away\n\nWell they went after him on Twitter, so it wouldnt suprise me if it wasn't on the news. Twitter journalists flaming a celebrity isnt really a headline story. This is the first I heard of it. \n\nBesides that if I was one of those big players I wouldn't go out of the way to blast him, I'd just keep my mouth shut. Straight up trying to use media control to smear Elon as an antisemite would be a little ham fisted for this kind of thing, especially because he didn't specifically mention the Jewish faith. These people are smarter than that. Better to ignore him and let the little journalists do what they do best.\n\nThe keys to a controlled media are silence, distraction, and repetition. With the whole question of why every media company is owned by Jews, for a start they simply never mention it or anything even remotely close to the topic. When you and a few buddies control 90% of the media production in the country, you can erase entire outlooks from the country simply by never airing them. \n\nWhat they do repetitively show to their audience is the jew as a victim, and often as the most helpless sort. The holocaust is used as a cugel to label \"antisemites\" as the most vile form of racists, the absolute worst of humanity. If an antisemitic crime is committed somewhere in the country, it is given a glowing spotlight. Sometimes they drag out stories about gathering neo-Nazis just to drive it home that the Jews are innocent victims and utterly unthreatening to anyone. That way when people hear anything that even hints to something seriously weird about the Jews in power, they will immediately shut themselves off and label that person as one of those evil antisemites on the news. If someone were to mention something like that despite making up 1.4% of Americans, thirty of the one hundred richest people in this country are Jewish, most people will react angrily, sometimes even violently. All because of programming repeated for our entire life and drilled deep into the mind. \n\nThey do a similar thing for conspiracy theorists in general. The term was coined by the FBI, who created the trope of the crazy gross conspiracy theorist in the first place. This has been perpetuated by the media and is now most peoples default image for the conspiracy theorist. That way when someone starts telling you that monolithic media corporations are programming your behavioral patterns, morals, and loyalty through the media and that you should seriously be concerned, there is already a modeled response. Its kind of like a vaccine. They hear these things, identify them as \"conspiracy talk\" and file it away with the flat earth theory as some weirdos delusion just like the news said to. Ten years ago how would people have reacted if you insisted that the government collects and stores every phone call, text and email in the country? You'd be called a loony. But you would have been right.\n\nOccasionally someone important will slip up and say something questioning the Jews, and on these occasions we are reminded the punishment for not responding to the priming. Usually the loss of jobs, friends, family, as well as harassment from strangers,  and just a general wave of hatred and social rejection. Anyone who questions these things is treated like a monster and compared to the cartoonish nazis the media has prepared as basically the embodiment of pure evil. This is for all intents and purposes a pointed warning to anyone who starts questioning the programming. Don't say a word, or there will be serious social consequences. When people do begin to notice things about the Jews, they know they need to say nothing unless with someone who is trusted completely. \n\nThese people are very, very good at this stuff.  A lot of work has been done in the field of mass psychology in the last fifty years. From early psychological experiments to the rise of mass data collection services, the people in power have amassed a wealth of data and a system of tools which allow the subtle control of the masses. How many of your values or opinions have been taken from movies, tv, or the internet? Try to identify the ones that seem forced or just odd. Some of these might not be your own. You will find the conditioning is buried deep, but even just awareness of it is an important step. The goal of these organizations is to shape your thoughts, but to do it in a manner that makes you believe they are your own. For example, a choice between two political parties which are functionally similar but depicted as hated opposites which let you decide such key issues as what bathroom people should use or whether we should smoking weed is chill. Meanwhile the real players hash out issues we couldn't understand well enough to vote on in the first place, ones that actually matter.\n\nEh what started as a comment grew into as essay but whatever. The point is those who control the media control how we perceive the world outside our home. This is a power that they very deliberately use, and have gotten very good at with. And yes, the owners of the six major media conglomerates in America are all Jewish. There is a similar trend in the banking industry though that is a slightly different topic.

{"author": "thinkcontrol", "body": "&gt;Why is this Anti-semitic belief shared by so many on the far-right?\n\nNot all forms of antisemitism are equal. You may hate Jews, because of how they treated you, or behaved towards your kind, but the extent to which you do varies. A far-right European man and an Islamic Arab man would have separate reasons, as you can see from the host of crimes or actions the manifesto mentions. \n\n&gt;Why is that?\n\nThis is an apt scenario for many casual observers to analyze. Both manifestos reacts to Jewry. Brenton is reacting to Islamic invasion of the West. Earnests is reacting to a wider picture of Jewry. How is the anti-Islamic sentiment associated with Jewry? If you dig into a bit of history, between the Abrahamic faiths and its peoples, a Muslim conquest would be afforded by Jewish aid. Muslim invaders would leave control of a region or city to Jews, Moors, etc. while Christians died defending. Jewish encyclopedia states \"It remains a fact that the Jews either directly or through their co-religionists in Africa, encouraged the Mohammedans to conquer Spain.\" In other words, Jews and Muslims work in tandem to sever the ties of a nation from its Christianhood.\n\n&gt;As far as I could tell its some \"white genocide conspiracy theory\" but who are these jews in power carrying this out?\n\nI'm not entirely sure where they base the theory from, but I've recollected the Kalergi plan and Hootan plan as possible foundations, as well as the book You Gentiles. The Talmud could be one of the inspirations, as much as an atheist would refer the Bible, its nitpicked quotes for example, as one of their reasons to oppose Christianity. Oddly enough, my pathway to atheism came from a Jewish author who argued against Christianity. \n\nI think some time ago, when Communists, widely regarded as Jewish revolutionaries in letters and correspondence, from Soviet Russia, came to America as spies, politicians, etc. their economics was not welcome with open arms. They had to pressure, buy, kill, whatever means necessary to take hold of U.S. politics. AIPAC, an unregistered foreign agent of Israel, is on par with the influence of the Military Industrial Complex. These Communists infiltrated both major parties and subverted them to meet one goal: serve Israeli interests. Communists on the right shifted into Neocons, Communists on the left had very few changes to mold into Democrats of today. They only had to dial up the Liberalism every decade or so. Because the left holds Individualism with high regard, it is simple for strangers, foreigners, immigrants, LGBT, minorities, etc. to ease into that ideology and way of life. \n\nDemocracy is determined by demographics. If you invite and flood en masse immigrants of every walk of life, you can undermine the traditions and culture of America very quickly with a new population. The emphasis on minorities and LGBT was not as strong until women could vote. Hence the cries of patriarchy and clarion calls for social justice. Egalitarianism is considered 'common sense' in this day and age, because of how slowly politics transformed from within by foreign actors of influence. The far right believes that this creeping common sense interpretations works on the average Conservative because it evokes their sense of equality despite its insidious effects on the nation. On a related note, Earnest could have mentioned that the Hart-Cellar Act was pushed by a Russian Jew. \n\nBut who are these Jews? Before I understood social identity theories, Jews, to me, were nothing but a religious group. I noticed, even when I wasn't trying to notice, that people, of MSM and entertainment positions, many would consider White or Anglo, were in fact Jews. I thought why is there an emphasis on skin. There is a better form of categorization, which is agenda. Lots of leftist talking points had a clear agenda, as you might yourself be aware. But it took me some time to notice how right wingers and religionists were subverted by Jews. The only form of ethnostate or nationalism afforded by the right were Zionist in nature. White nationalism was quickly snuffed out, even more so on the right. However, opposition to Islamic culture or Muslim peoples was just fine. Then pieces started to fall in place. The strength of the American military and MIC would be able to defend Israel. American interests were co-opted by Israeli interests. Muslim nations were destabilized at the expense of American blood and money with Jewish leadership. If you look at the Neocons who push the Iraq war, you might see the aims of foreign policy. \n\nThe far right is anti semitic for their own perceived reasons if they prioritize their own nation, blood, soil, culture, over foreign actors, allies, etc. As far as I can tell, accusations of antisemitism is a means to prevent their return to tradition, by extension retake control. There is a recoil to being labeled an antisemite, they way liberals act choked should bigotry from their past surfaces. It is not a coincidence either. ADL is a Jewish organization that has power over social media networks and have the capacity to censor and most importantly define wrongthink. \n\nBut what about non-Jewish, Christian, atheist politicians? I fear it's the same scenario in social sciences. To prevent any visible Jewish influence from showing, they give outward facing positions to gentiles. This helps to cover their tracks should the science community divert from a disinterested pursuit to a political one. I'm not giving the explanation any justice here, so I have to point you to The Culture of Critique by Macdonald. If you can follow this train of thought, Ilhan Omar serves a purpose with her antisemitism, so that right wingers as a whole naturally rebel not just against Muslims, but antisemites. You cannot be a politician, at least a successful one, without towing the line of Jewish interests, even if it means play dead or decoy. \n\n&gt;So islamists and extreme right-wingers (whatever you wanna call John Earnest idk what label to give him) share the same hate and contempt for jews?\n\nThey hate Jewish behavior for different reasons the way someone tackles a perceived problem from different angles. \n\n&gt;And is it jews as in the ethnicity, the people of Israel? Or is it just jews, believers of judaism?\n\nEarnests implies both. Tarrant implies Jews who misbehave. Earnests has some insight that Jews with power will destroy gentile structure. Tarrant believes Israel is acting on its own interests the way America should act on its own interests. In any case, they both seem to recognize the fact that Jews as a whole act as a unit, as if to say there is a Semitic agenda, and that there is a gentile agenda. \n\n&gt;Why are jews considered a bigger threat than islamists?\n\nWell, the Abrahamic faiths have lots in common. Diaspora is not exclusive to Jewish people. Islam also functions as a diaspora and can use this form and status as a means of attack and conquest. If Muslims cannot go ideologically, they spread racially, and where they cannot go as a race, they go as ideas. Islam cycles between being a race, religion, philosophy, body politic, culture, and means of law. Adopting as many traits as it can, at any given moment, in whatever combination will most enable it fly beneath the radar. In Earnests point of view, Jews have done the same within U.S. politics, as an ally and an oppressed minority. It's quite possible that Earnests believes that Russia is a bastion of Christianity, and this modern opposition to Russia, using America as a political war machine, is a form of Jewry that is more dangerous than Islamists overseas. White Americans have died serving for Israeli interests, according to Earnests; in fact, I believe he would recall that the Talmud refers goyim, or non-Jews, to be slaves.", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "AskTrumpSupporters", "date_year_month": "2019-05", "created_utc_converted": "2019-05-17 22:44:20", "score_overall": 14, "words": "jewish jewish conspiracy jewish jewish jew jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish goyim", "shared_words": "jewish conspiracy jew goyim", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "mrhouse1101", "body": "I think that, in the long run, we will have to have a one state solution. If you look at israeli policy thus far, they are using the settlements as a way of increasing their power and influence over the region and expanding the territorial control. The difference between pro-Israel and pro-palestine is really the moral interpretation of these actions. pro-Israel says that israel is doing this to preserve itself (defensive) pro-palistine is saying that they are doing this to expand their power and influence (offensive). But, in the end, the result is the same. The expulsion of the Palestinian people from the area.\n\nI think that the long term (meaning several decades) goal of the international community will be trying to find a way to integrate arabs into israel and convert israel from a jewish state into a secular cosmopolitan democracy. Like the US. But Zionists dont want this because this would mean that israel would no longer be a jewish majority state. Arabs would have significant impact on the elections results. I think future generation will be more open to this idea as society becomes more secular and multiculturalism becomes the norm. The rise in a nationalism accross the world is simply a \"last hurrah\" of a bygone era where people were divided into ethnic or religious identities. But in the words of Heath Ledger's joke *\"These mob fools [aka nationalists] want you [other identites] gone so they can go back to the way things were. But I know the truth. There is no going back. You've changed things. Forever.\"*\n\nLiberalism and globalism are a Pandora's box. We've opened this can of worms and now there is no going back. The only way is forward. We should be trying to find ways of improving the economic conditions of Palestine, giving them aid, improving their education. Once they are economically viable for mass global trade, more countries, including Israel, will start viewing them as a potential ally rather than an enemy or a burden. \n\nRemember, in a globalist capitalist system, the only forces more powerful than hate and fear are greed and lust. By integrating the palestinians into the world economy, we will be able to bring them peace and prosperity in the long run. \n\nAlso, poverty makes people more desperate and leads to increased radicalism. Just look at 1930s Germany. Their economic crisis paved the way for fascism. Helping people economically will do the opposite. Lowering inequality and increasing prosperity will inevitably help stabilize the region. Otherwise, people who have nothing to loose will resort to violence and will rely on religiouse zealots to empower their anti-imperialist revolutions. That's why I support BDS. Because it gives palestinians an option B. Rather than resorting to violence, they can resort to boycotts and occasional riots/prostests. It channels their anger in the right direction (as in, away from guns and artilary shells). Like this movement or not, silencing it will only result in more palestinians viewing option A as more viable.\n\nI also think palestine would greatly benefit from more international students coming to learn there. It will cause their economy to boom. I think having an program where israeli student and palestinian students visit both nations are good. On one hand, its risky because this can he leveraged by terrorist organizations who can use this as an opportunity to kidnap Israeli students. But this is also why it can be so effective. Because it will show the world who the true enemies of Israel and Palestine are (the ethnic nationalists, zealots and terrorists). Also, it's a lot harder to keep a territory closed off and occupied when people from your country want to trade freely with that territory. This will inevitably result in more people in israel and in the west becoming sympathetic to palestine and will also result in economic prosperity and growth.\n\nIt will also deter more terrorist attacks because war and terrorism are bad for business. And as I've stated before, in our global economic and geopolitical system, love for money trumps hate for other people. That's why in the United states, so many companies are going liberal/left.

I grew up very secular, only to go down a dark path in my teenage years, getting involved with real satanism.  I'm not talking about the white middle class teenage rebel badass atheism satanism to annoy our parents but the actual occult, animal sacrifice, cover ourselves in blood, seance, conjurings, low to mid level crime satanism.  After some drama that I'm not going to get in to, I came to explore my Jewish roots as I was exposed to a lot of kaballah as a result of my past so the curiosity and search for clarity and truth was there.  Now, about a decade later, I'm a frum, hassidic woman living in Jerusalem.  I do consider myself a feminist but not in the modern political man hating sense but the classic equal opportunity sense.\n\n&gt;Unlike Christianity, Judaism has never had a serous reform movement that has appealed to all Jews.\n\nYou realize the Reformation also didn't appeal to all Christians?  That's why there are Catholics AND Protestants.  They went to a terribly bloody war with each other over it.  What makes reformation \"real\" if some people change and reform while some remain in the classic tradition?\n\n&gt;Instead, we've fractured into distinct sects--Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform--which seldom even recognize one another as \"Jewish\" (everybody recognizes Orthodox Jews as Jewish, but Orthodox Jews seldom recognize Reform Jews as Jews). \n\nRealize, before the haskala, there were only Jews.  Afterwards, the Reform Jews labeled themselves \"Reform\", as that's what they claimed to do.  They labeled the frum Jews \"Orthodox\" since they clung to the traditional roots of the religion.

You use really harsh language but you've already demonstrated your lack of Jewish history and your lack of understanding Jewish law, so why should we accept your view regarding a messianic goal?\n\n&gt;Reform Judaism has undoubtedly done much to promote women's rights and gender equality. \n\nAt what expense?\n\n&gt;You can argue that it might not have done enough or that there's more that Reform and Conservative Judaism could do to promote gender equality\n\nSuch as what?  They (reform) already allow women to do any role a male rabbi can do. They allow same sex marriage, intermarriage, bar/bat mitzvah for non jews, bark mitzvah for dogs, and probably more I'm unaware of.  The conservative at least keeps some decorum and don't completely turn Judaism into a money making scheme for themselves.\n \n&gt;but there's really no denying that Reform Judaism at least is ahead of the game when it comes to women's rights .I'm not Reform (I'm an atheist), but I think Reform, and even Conservative, is deserving of some praise for their recognition of women as intrinsically human and as being deserving of the same rights as men.\n\nIs it actually praiseworthy when an organization uses women to push a political agenda with the intention of being contrary?  Aren't they more like an object when people go \"look at that woman!  She's a rabbi and she's doing that politically liberal (leftist) thing we really like!\"  Women are used as objects to sell things like cars and food.  Why not use them to sell something sexy like a \"progressive\" religion that appeals to your political leanings?\n\n&gt;Compare this, however, with Orthodox Judaism. For example, in all Orthodox synagogues men pray separately from women, and in many women are relegated to an upstairs gallery.\n\nYes, we pray separately.  No, not necessarily upstairs.  It all depends on the architecture of the building.  Most places I've entered are side by side, sometimes men in front of the women, but rarely are they the balcony style.  That isn't to say those don't exist, they certainly do.  But there are many layouts so you should be more honest about that.\n\nBut you also need to explain why men and women praying separately is a bad thing.\n\n&gt;Gender hierarchies are entrenched in ~~Jewish~~ thought:\n\nFTFY.  Hierarchies are everywhere pal.\n\n&gt;a blessing Orthodox Jewish men are required to say everyday thanks a God \"who has not made me a woman\".\n\nThat is correct.  Why do the men say such a blessing?  What does it actually mean?  Surely you have an answer since you're so passionate about this topic.  I imagine you did your research.\n\nBTW, whether or not in the context of a bracha, if I say, \"I'm glad I'm not a man,\" is that a mysandric statement?\n\n&gt;This contempt of women was perhaps made most glaring early last year when the Israeli Orthodox Mishpacha magazine published an article on the Holocaust, only to have digitally blurred any images containing women\n\nContext matters here.  There are many views on modesty in Judaism, many leniencies and stringencies.  Unfortunately, you can't please all the people all the time no matter what you do.  My guess is that the magazine assumed that, when it comes to their audience, this was the wise decision.  I imagine a secular person like you has no interest in subscribing to the magazine, so they won't consider your feelings on the matter.  A more liberal, orthodox Jew may be a subscriber and not like the decision, but they would at least be understanding and sympathetic to the editors decision since they live the lifestyle.  To feign anger at this is silly.  It's like if I got mad at a similar editorial choice in a Christian or Islamic publication.  I'm not their audience so while I can have feelings about their editorial choices, I'm not their target audience.\n\n&gt;So where is the #MeToo of Jewish women?\n\n#metoo has a specific context and I don't agree with using it outside of the sexual abuse context or else it'll render it meaningless.\n\n&gt;Why is there nothing but deafening silence about this systematic silencing and even erasure of Jewish women in the Orthodox world?\n\nI mean, this is patently false.  There is much in the orthodox world of powerful, influential women.  While I'm not personally a fan, Women of the Wall plays a role in bringing women closer to Torah Judaism, learning sources, praying, and having a love of Torah.  It's unfortunate that some of what they do draws such ire, but that's going to happen with any group pushing the boundaries like that.\n\n&gt;Because you cannot say anything if you don't have a mouth and Orthodox Jewish women don't have the right to speak out about this oppression.\n\nThere are those that do speak of the oppression.  You can find numerous op-eds on most Jewish blogs or newspapers out there.\n\n&gt;And for those of us who are not Orthodox, we know we're not supposed to speak about these issues because if we paint the Orthodox badly, we're guilty of treason, of bringing the nation of Judaism into shame.\n\nYou're not the first nor the last to do this.  Stop acting like such a martyr.  It's silly.\n\n&gt;So in the end, we're as guilty of perpetuating this abuse of women as the Orthodox themselves are.\n\nSo stop abusing women.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nThere are a number of fascinating Orthodox Jewish women you clearly aren't aware of.  Rebbizen Heller was a dear mentor of mine once upon a time.  The late wife of Rabbi Machlis ran the most giving home in Jerusalem, hosting over 100 people, Jewish, non Jewish, etc - every shabbat for countless years.  Penina Taylor who works on anti missionary programs.  Rebbizen Brodt who still caters to her late husbands following of us Chibakuk-niks.  I'm sure there are many other women I'm unaware of as I can only network so far by myself.  Plus, there are plenty of male rabbeium who are infleuntial and matter to women, but I guess they only matter if you care what women think.\n\nAdditionally, https://www.facebook.com/ravaaron/posts/10157467053776995 \n\nRabbi Aaron Lebowitz who is an influential figure in the Jerusalem community has come out in favor of giving women smicha.  While he is doing something progressive that'll rustle a lot of feathers of more traditional people, I support what he's doing for various reasons.  So your claims against the orthodox world lose and merit they may have had once they're put in context.  \n\nNote: not all my uses of \"you/your\" are aimed directly at you.

{"author": "pussy_seizure", "body": "By James Angelos\nMay 21, 2019\n\nOne of Wenzel Michalski\u2019s early recollections of growing up in southern Germany in the 1970s was of his father, Franz, giving him some advice: \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone that you\u2019re Jewish.\u201d Franz and his mother and his little brother had survived the Holocaust by traveling across swaths of Eastern and Central Europe to hide from the Gestapo, and after the war, his experiences back in Germany suggested that, though the Nazis had been defeated, the anti-Semitism that was intrinsic to their ideology had not. This became clear to Franz when his teachers in Berlin cast stealthily malicious glances at him when Jewish characters \u2014 such as Shylock in \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d \u2014 came up in literature. \u201cEh, Michalski, this exactly pertains to you,\u201d he recalls one teacher telling him through a clenched smile. Many years later, when he worked as an animal-feed trader in Hamburg, he didn\u2019t tell friends that he was Jewish and held his tongue when he heard them make anti-Semitic comments. And so Franz told his son Wenzel that things would go easier for him if he remained quiet about being Jewish. \u201cThe moment you say it, things will become very awkward.\u201d\n\nAs a teenager, Wenzel defied his father\u2019s advice and told a close friend. That friend quickly told his mother, and the next time Wenzel saw her, she reacted quite strongly, hugging him and kissing his face: \u201cWenzel! Oh, my Wenzel!\u201d Now a stocky, bearded 56-year-old, Wenzel recalled the moment to me on a recent Saturday afternoon. He raised the pitch of his voice as he continued to mimic her: \u201cYou people! You are the most intelligent! The most sensitive! You are the best pianists in the world! And the best poets!\u201d In his normal voice again, he added, \u201cThen I understood what my father meant.\u201d\n\nWenzel Michalski is now the director of Human Rights Watch for Germany. He and his wife, Gemma, an outgoing British expat, live in a cavernous apartment building in the west of Berlin. In their kitchen, Gemma told me that after arriving in Germany in 1989, she often got a strangely defensive reaction when she told people she was Jewish; they would tell her they didn\u2019t feel responsible for the Holocaust or would defend their grandparents as not having perpetrated it. And so, to avoid conversations like these, she, too, stayed quiet about being Jewish.\n\nRecently, the Michalskis\u2019 youngest son became the third generation of the family to learn that telling people he is Jewish could cause problems. The boy \u2014 whose parents asked that he be called by one of his middle names, Solomon, to protect his privacy \u2014 had attended a Jewish primary school in Berlin. But he didn\u2019t want to stay in such a homogeneous school for good, so just before he turned 14, he transferred to a public school that was representative of Germany\u2019s new diversity \u2014 a place, as Gemma described it, where he \u201ccould have friends with names like Hassan and Ahmed.\u201d\n\nThe first few days there seemed to go well. Solomon, an affable kid with an easy smile, bonded with one classmate over their common affection for rap music. That classmate introduced him to a German-Turkish rapper who would rap about \u201cAllah and stuff,\u201d Solomon told me. In return, he introduced the classmate to American and British rap. Solomon had a feeling they would end up being best friends. On the fourth day, when Solomon was in ethics class, the teachers asked the students what houses of worship they had been to. One student mentioned a mosque. Another mentioned a church. Solomon raised his hand and said he\u2019d been to a synagogue. There was a strange silence, Solomon later recalled. One teacher asked how he had encountered a synagogue.\n\n\u201cEveryone was shocked, especially the teachers,\u201d Solomon later told me about this moment. After class, a teacher told Solomon that he was \u201cvery brave.\u201d Solomon was perplexed. As Gemma explained: \u201cHe didn\u2019t know that you\u2019re not meant to tell anyone.\u201d\n\nThe following day, Solomon brought brownies to school for his birthday. He was giving them out during lunch when the boy he had hoped would be his best friend informed him that there were a lot of Muslim students at the school who used the word \u201cJew\u201d as an insult. Solomon wondered whether his friend included himself in this category, and so after school, he asked for clarification. The boy put his arm around Solomon\u2019s shoulders and told him that, though he was a \u201creal babo\u201d \u2014 Kurdish slang for \u201cboss\u201d \u2014 they couldn\u2019t be friends, because Jews and Muslims could not be friends. The classmate then rattled off a series of anti-Semitic comments, according to Solomon: that Jews were murderers, only interested in money.\n\nOver the next few months, Solomon was bullied in an increasingly aggressive fashion. One day, he returned home with a large bruise from a punch on the back. On another occasion, Solomon was walking home and stopped into a bakery. When he emerged, he found one of his tormentors pointing what looked like a handgun at him. Solomon\u2019s heart raced. The boy pulled the trigger. Click. The gun turned out to be a fake. But it gave Solomon the scare of his life.\n\nWhen Solomon first told his parents about the bullying, they resolved to turn it into a teaching moment. They arranged to have Wenzel\u2019s father visit the school to share his story about escaping the Gestapo. But the bullying worsened, Gemma told me, and they felt the school did not do nearly enough to confront the problem. The Michalskis went public with their story in 2017, sharing it with media outlets in order to spark what they viewed as a much-needed discussion about anti-Semitism in German schools. Since then, dozens of cases of anti-Semitic bullying in schools have come to light, including one case last year at the German-American school where my own son attends first grade, in which, according to local news reports, students tormented a ninth grader, for months, chanting things like \u201cOff to Auschwitz in a freight train.\u201d Under criticism for its handling of the case, the administration released a statement saying it regretted the school\u2019s initial response but was taking action and having \u201cintensive talks\u201d with the educational staff.\n\nThe principal of Solomon\u2019s school, in an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt, also said his school had made a concerted effort to resolve the problem. When the reporter asked him if the bullying illustrated the \u201cunreflective behavior of pubescent youths\u201d or \u201crooted anti-Semitism,\u201d the principal paused to say this was a \u201cvery dangerous\u201d question but then answered: \u201cIt\u2019s very possible that anti-Semitism is the motive. But we can\u2019t look inside the heads of these students.\u201d (When asked for comment, a representative for the Berlin Senate Department for Education, Youth and Families, which oversees Berlin\u2019s public schools, said it had put into place anti-discrimination measures such as training courses and workshops for students and faculty.)\n\nFor the Michalskis, all this was evidence that German society never truly reckoned with anti-Semitism after the war. Germany had restored synagogues and built memorials to the victims of the Holocaust, Wenzel said: \u201cSo for a lot of mainstream, middle-class people, that means: \u2018We\u2019ve done it. We dealt with anti-Semitism.\u2019 But nobody really dealt with it within the families. The big, the hard, the painful questions were never asked.\u201d In Wenzel\u2019s view, the Muslim students who tormented his child were acting in an environment that was already suffused with native anti-Semitism. \u201cA lot of conservative politicians now say, \u2018Oh, the Muslims are importing their anti-Semitism to our wonderful, anti-anti-Semitic culture,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s bull. They\u2019re trying to politicize this.\u201d\n\nJewish life in Germany was never fully extinguished. After the Nazi genocide of six million Jews, some 20,000 Jewish displaced persons from Eastern Europe ended up settling permanently in West Germany, joining an unknown number of the roughly 15,000 surviving German Jews who still remained in the country after the war. The new German political class rejected, in speeches and in the law, the rabid anti-Semitism that had been foundational to Nazism \u2014 measures considered not only to be morally imperative but necessary to re-establish German legitimacy on the international stage. This change, however, did not necessarily reflect an immediate conversion in longstanding anti-Semitic attitudes on the ground. In the decades that followed, a desire among many Germans to deflect or repress guilt for the Holocaust led to a new form of antipathy toward Jews \u2014 a phenomenon that came to be known as \u201csecondary anti-Semitism,\u201d in which Germans resent Jews for reminding them of their guilt, reversing the victim and perpetrator roles. \u201cIt seems the Germans will never forgive us Auschwitz,\u201d Hilde Walter, a German-Jewish journalist, was quoted as saying in 1968.", "score": 7, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "TrueReddit", "date_year_month": "2019-05", "created_utc_converted": "2019-05-21 15:27:20", "score_overall": 17, "words": "jewish holocaust jewish merchant jewish jewish jewish holocaust jewish jewish jewish jew holocaust jewish jewish holocaust jewish", "shared_words": "jewish holocaust merchant jew", "socre_distint": 4}
{"author": "melechshelyat", "body": "&gt; We can see that in the ties modern politicians / groups / movements have to well documented anti-semitic views. The most recent examples are the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, VA where protestors chanted \"Jews Will Not Replace Us\", Rep.

Two other Democratic Congresspeople were at the same dinner.\n\n&gt; Left wing movements have often been criticized for their critiques of Israeli policy, most notably in regards to Israeli policy towards Palestine. The majority of these claims against the left come from the Labour Party (UK) mishandling a situation that was seen as some as being anti-semitic\n\nIt's not mishandling \"a situation\". It's a long, serious pattern of antisemitism, not something \"seen as some as being antisemitic\".\n\nPlenty of Labour members have outright left the party over antisemitism. [51% of Brits](https://news.sky.com/story/more-than-half-of-britons-think-labour-has-serious-antisemitism-problem-poll-reveals-11696752) think Labour has a \"serious antisemitism problem\" (I bet it's higher if \"serious\" was left out). Only 18% disagreed. Painting it as \"some\" is disingenuous at best.\n\nMore than [85% of British Jews](https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/more-than-85-per-cent-of-british-jews-think-jeremy-corbyn-is-antisemitic-1.469654), the people paying the most attention, think the head of Labour is antisemitic.\n\nAmong the things Labour has done or failed to do, and Corbyn personally has done:\n\n* Praised Raed Salah as an \"honourable citizen\", after Salah was convicted for hate speech for claiming Jews steal Christian babies and use their blood for Passover matzoh. That includes praise *after Salah was convicted again on appeal in UK courts*.\n\n* Said a mural depicting antisemitic themes (Rothschilds running the world alongside other wealthy figures) shouldn't be taken down.\n\n* Was part of multiple Facebook groups with regular antisemitic content posted.\n\n* Labour's antisemitism training is being [run by a Labour activist](https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/labour-activist-behind-antisemitic-rant-is-to-deliver-training-on-jew-hate-to-party-members-1.484235) who claimed Jews were making up claims of antisemitism, called Jewish leaders \"part of the problem\" for allegedly making this up, and based on false statements that a Jewish group had allied with an extremist far-right group, said \"What on earth are Jews doing in the gutter with these rats?\", as though one Jewish group (even if it had allied with the group, which it hadn't) represents all Jews.\n\n* Went to meetings for and praised Deir Yassin Remembered (as well as donated to it), even after the leader of the group was revealed to be a Holocaust denier.\n\n* Claimed that Stephen Sizer, who has posited numerous conspiracy theories and antisemitic claims, including 9/11 trutherism, was being criticized for being anti-Israel, despite his blatant and open antisemitism (they're not the same thing, obviously).\n\n* Laid a wreath for the planners of the Munich Massacre where 12 Israeli Olympians were killed at the Munich Olympics in 1972, then denied he was at that particular ceremony (claiming it was for different dead Palestinians), then photos and evidence confirmed he was in front of it, then he said he was there but \"didn't think he was involved\" in laying the wreath for those antisemitic terrorists, then filed a complaint with the British regulator for media accuracy claiming it was all a smear, then withdrew the complaint quietly when no one was looking.\n\nI could go on, and on, and on. It's not one small thing. There are reports of tens of thousands of instances of antisemitism all throughout the Labour party, all being ignored. Seriously, a [15,000 page report](https://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-group-releases-report-with-15000-instances-of-labour-party-anti-semitism/) was recently released by the Labour Against Antisemitism group, showing hundreds of members and officials making antisemitic comments and posts online.\n\n&gt; statements made by Ilhan Omar which many believe taken out of context\n\n\"Many\". Look, she apologized herself for at least two of them, which pretty much everyone said were antisemitic because they *were*.\n\n&gt; Many on the right have also tried to paint the BDS movement as anti-semetic (it's not)\n\nThe BDS movement has its goal as the destruction of Israel, according to its leaders. You can disagree with Israeli policies, you can criticize it, but calling to destroy Israel is antisemitic. That's not just my opinion, that's the opinion of the EU, US, and even the [head of the UN](https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/UN-Chief-Guterres-UN-will-treat-Israel-with-impartiality-503600).\n\nCalling to destroy Israel, as the BDS movement calls to do, is a call to deny Jews the internationally guaranteed right of self-determination. Denying Jews a right is antisemitism, plain and simple.\n\n&gt; If you were to try to make an argument as to who is more anti-semitic, its undoubtedly the right wing in the context of contemporary western politics.\n\nI don't think there's a way to reliably measure or compare the two. Both have strong antisemitic tendencies right now.\n\n&gt; However, I don't think its particularly productive to assert that Israel can't be criticized at all and anyone who is critical is automatically anti-semitic.\n\nNo one even said this here and it's completely disjointed from everything else we're discussing. This is just you trying to plant some kind of weird argument that no one is talking about.\n\nThere is a long history of antisemitism on the left. Heck, look at Ford himself. He was happy to hire black workers and was a staunch supporter of President Wilson (Democrat). But he was a virulent antisemite, as you've noted.\n\nOn university campuses today, the most left-wing students are happy to espouse [antisemitic views](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/brother-where-art-thou-a-call-to-join-the-defense-of-israels-right-to-exist/). The author there writes about how he went to a campus to talk about Israel and provide a counterpoint to the anti-Israel views there, and found students:\n\n&gt; But before I could get a response out of my mouth, the student would answer their own question with a blunt yet shocking answer, and it would always begin with, \u201cA a Jew, I hope you don\u2019t get offended but\u2026\u201d And that\u2019s when the Protocols of the Elders of Zion would come rushing out of the gates: the Jews control the media; the Jews control politics; the Jews own all the money; and the Jews band together for complete world domination.\n\n&gt; This did not happen once, twice or three times, but occurred on five separate occasions.\n\nThere are plenty of examples of other universities with the same problem. Remember Rachel Beyda, the Jewish student who [said a Jewish student couldn't be unbiased](https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/10/opinions/kosmin-anti-semitism-campus/index.html) (dual loyalty accusations have a long history of use against Jews, and no other student was asked a similar question ever for another background). There's plenty of university professors who say similarly antisemitic things, though sometimes they substitute \"Israel\" for \"Jews\". One Columbia professor [said Israel is responsible for most of the world's problems](https://www.timesofisrael.com/columbia-u-alums-call-for-professor-to-be-suspended-over-anti-zionist-posts/), and calls \"Zionists\" a \"Fifth column\" (sound familiar? Nazi rhetoric, replacing \"Jews\" with \"Israel\" and \"Zionists\").\n\nOver at Williams College just now, [students](https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/284998/separate-and-unequal-on-campus) on the left tried to hold pro-Israel student groups to a separate standard. That's not antisemitic in and of itself, but then they hid the video of the student government meeting, and tried to keep the transcript private. A reporter got ahold of it, and among the things said were:\n\n&gt; The student who made the assertions about World War II assured the council, \u201cI have a lot of Jewish friends.\u201d Another dismissed anti-Semitism as a possible motive, since \u201cthe Arabs are actually Semites, so the term anti-Semitic is not very accurate to describe whatever people use it to describe.\u201d In a revealing admission, however, the council\u2019s note taker excluded \u201cclearly anti-Semitic things\u201d from his minutes of the April 23 council meeting.\n\nSo not only did they *exclude clearly anti-Semitic things* from being written down, they *still left in* common antisemitic tropes. This is how they described the Holocaust:\n\n&gt; Unlike the seemingly unending Israeli occupation of the West Bank, \u201cthe purpose of these [World War II] ghettos were basically to control, segregate, and separate the Jewish people for short periods of time.\u201d\n\nIf you're talking about right-wing and left-wing, they take different forms and hide in different ways, and different segments of society follow each.

This is echoing antisemitic propaganda like the Protocols of Zion which are the basis of a ton of conspiracy theories, namely that the Jews control world politics.

A conspiracy of this magnitude - capable of rewriting history and manipulating school curriculums on a global scale - would require an unrealistic amount of cohesion and secrecy with no room for leaks throughout a scope of centuries, not to mention resources. I had a sinking feeling this would be about Jews the very moment you mentioned \"ethnicity\".\n\nBut don't you find it strange, then, that this ominous threat that has control over *all* the media (you know, the world is a bit bigger than just the US) and the way we write our history did not manage to erase the most obvious weak spot -- proof of their mere existence? Yet it is this allegedly manipulated history that, apart from the cherrypicked pieces you consider falsified, is at the same time your evidence for the wickedness of this ethnicity, whose evil ways are apparently passed on as a matter of blood, completely contradicting everything we know about human social dynamics.\n\nLikewise, don't you consider it strangely fruitous that this global genetic conspiracy did not manage to take control of the internet itself? The technical means to keep track of everything a person does on the web already exist, yet random people on the world wide web can apparently freely converse about this grand terrible secret. It *should* be easy to put a stop to such rumors and remove those dangerous activists who threaten to expose the conspiracy, no?\n\nTo say nothing of the internal inconsistencies of this theory, such as an inherently religious culture allegedly promoting atheism (or is the Jewish faith also just part of some cover?), or feminism being a Jewish plot (pretty sure some ultraorthodox Jew got a heart attack just about now purely because of the thought being mentioned). You also seem to be unaware that homosexuality was a thing that existed in other cultures before they even had contact with a European civilization, such as the concept of wakashudo among samurai, unless you'd assume that this, too, was just made up by Jews who would have full control over xenophobic Japan as well.

Your perception seems to be based on the idea that it is simply impossible for people to come up with ideals of equality and tolerance by themselves; everything is connected to terrorism, there is no room for human beings simply trying to create a better world. I suppose this must mean that I, too, am a terrorist in your eyes, and I now find myself a bit creeped out by what might happen to me if things would go your way. You talk calmly and polite now, yet you justify wars of aggression (WW2), violent oppression of political opponents (COINTELPRO) and even leave open the question of whether the holocaust has actually happened, not even being able to admit that much of history may be true.\n\nYou actually go as far back as the Revolt of Judea, citing it as \"Zionists getting kicked out of a country\" and apparently missing the little detail that it was *their own homeland* that had been under Roman military occupation, and declare anti-taxation protests a \"political and ideological agenda\", seemingly missing out on the similarity to the US' own history in terms of gaining independence from the British Empire. I guess this part of history might just be not true for you as well, but then why would you link it as proof for your argument?\n\nIf *you* have read this far, my respect. I can only assume it must be frustrating to be presented with what must almost sound like a rant, and you probably believe me to be indoctrinated and another victim of this global conspiracy (which didn't even manage to prevent the fall of the USSR in spite of having all that power).\n\nI'm afraid if we can't even agree on basic history, and independent media as a reliable source of information, we really don't have much of a basis for a debate.\n\nThis may not mean much to you, but I hope that at some point you'll reconsider your perspective and begin to see people as individuals, rather than pre-programmed representatives of some stereotype, and the world to be far more diverse and complicated than this simple distinction into Good vs Evil, with many complex questions requiring complex answers, rather than a boogeyman whose destruction promises deliverance from everything that is bad.

{"author": "ValuableJackfruit", "body": "All minority groups advocate for multiculturalism, open borders etc, this is not specific to Jews. If you are an immigrant or a descendent of immigrants in a country you are way more likely to approve of further immigration etc based on emotional reasons, group interest etc. The difference is that Jews have a high social status while most other immigrant groups do not, so Jews have more power to actively influence politics, etc. Of course whites also do this, it's not specifically a Jewish thing but the liberal US Jews are very prominent in this sort of thing. It's also an economic issue, the multiculturalism/open borders/'strong empowered women must have careers' etc all of these things are essentially just propaganda by neoliberal capitalists  to get more workers, more cheap labour. It's all about money. And Jews are prominent in the field of 'money'. This is why Jews have always been disliked, they have high social status, influence over society, and work toward anti-nationalist goals. Other groups don't get the same hate because they simply never had the same amount of power. Add to this the fact that all of the Frankfurt School were Jewish, communism was invented by a Jew, communism in the Soviet Union was very Jewish dominated.\n\n Basically Jews have always had a large influence in all aspects of society in whatever country they lived in, and the objectives of these ruling classes are very often not in line with what the native population of these countries wanted which is why they have been thrown out of or exterminated in every country they have ever lived in. This is just an objective fact. Where people take it too far with the Jewish thing is the conspiracy thing IMO, the belief that Jews are intentionally working together to destroy whites etc like it is a deliberate strategy, like they are an organized group. This is obviously not true, the whole thing arises organically, as I said capitalists want cheap slave labour (whether they are Jewish or not), minorities will always want more immigration because it prevents racism against themselves, all ethnic groups prefer their own (hence the nepotism among Jews) and this is how you always end up with anti-Semitism - high powered ethnic minority ruling class ruling over another ethnic group and working towards goals that the native ethnic group doesn't like. And of course part of the reason why Jews are overrepresented in all these fields is simply because of their IQ / culture - they have always put education and money first, not all cultures have a tradition of this, which is why for example blacks and other groups are where they are today. But Jews are also very clannish and nepotism is rampant which contributes to why Harvard is like 30% Jewish etc, again this isn't a specifically Jewish thing, the same could be said about rich whites. People who have connections and are born into money are always way overrepresented in powerful positions than others, and Jews happen to be a group who are born into money and have connections.

The violence was an inexcusable act of mob justice that should not have occurred and claimed the lives of far more innocents than anyone who was guilty of anything (I'm speculating in favor of the victims here). That being said, I would not say '6000000' lives were threatened nor would I say that the Jews were being exterminated wholesale (while terrible, 14 and ~2000 deaths does not hold a candle to the entire population).

We've established a line, difficult to trace or not, which has allowed for an abundance of leaks. [And leaks there have been!](https://theevilofzionismexposedbyjews.weebly.com/index.html) Otherwise we wouldn't be talking about this at all. Jews aren't a hivemind, and I never said they were. We're talking about a very specific group of people, many of which, if you watched the video I linked in my 3/3 post, think that non-Jews are worthy of only being slaves. For a group that 'needs a lot of coordination', that thought seems to get through pretty clearly. \n\nOn the context of resources, we're talking about a conspiracy where the culprits have come into control of the media and banking industries. We've proven that they proliferate there.

Pushes for control are never instantaneous. Just like the Rothschilds built up their incredible banking empire over an extremely long period of time, so must Zionists adhere to the restraints involved in influencing politicians and vote outcomes to support authoritarian control over new forms of technology.

Do you really trust that this censorship and implementation of filters for what users are able to upload stops at copyright laws? Do you really trust that the installation of AI-enforced filters won't lend itself to this idea of a globalist conspiracy?\n\n&gt; I had a sinking feeling this would be about Jews the very moment you mentioned \"ethnicity\".\n\nI'd like to be clear here: [we're talking about Zionists, which do not represent all Jews.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUppu2OHVTY)&amp;&amp; This is much in the same way as ISIS does not represent all members of the muslim faith and the KKK does not represent all non-blacks.

Historians are of a free mind and record things as they interpret them. There's no one singular curator that all history must go through in order to be presented to the public, and that is why we have so many alternative history books and teachings varying on the country, whether they are truthful or not.\n\n&gt; such as an inherently religious culture allegedly promoting atheism (or is the Jewish faith also just part of some cover?)\n\nPrimarily, Jews hate Christianity because Christians claimed their religion and advocated that the Jewish messiah had finally come- to their distate, that messiah also revoked the Jews' title as the chosen people in favor of gentiles. As being a 'true' Jew is arguably a lineage issue, they don't really care what others believe, as long as it furthers Zionism. Non-Jews (goyim) are stupid slaves or cattle, remember?\n\n&gt; or feminism being a Jewish plot\n\nYou may have noticed \"giving women 'liberation'\" (quote marks included, hinting that it's unneeded) was part of The Protocols. The current waves of feminism do not advocate equality, but preferential treatment over men.\n\n&gt; You also seem to be unaware that homosexuality was a thing that existed in other cultures before they even had contact with a European civilization\n\nDo I? All I ever said was that it came alongside the 'new ideas' of the terrorists. Nowhere could you claim that I implied they invented the concept of homosexuality, nor do I think there's a little Jewish homosexuality fairy that convinces small children to not be straight even before they've been exposed to pop culture- that's just absurd. I think you're really misrepresenting my argument here.\n\n&gt; And let's not even get started about the alleged link between Jews and communists, in spite of\n\nI assume this is continued in the next paragraph?

Like I said, look for overwhelming commonalities to determine an infection. Parts can exist exclusive of said infection.\n\n&gt; You talk calmly and polite now...\n\nDo you assume I foam at the mouth in anger when I mention genuine and citable efforts of peace and mediation made by Germany before WW2?

What matters is how dangerous these subpopulations are relative to each other so the government can allocate resources to prevent the greatest number of murders possible. Thus, enforcing immigration law more harshly is an ineffective way to punish a population that is less likely to murder or commit crimes than native-born Americans. Illegal immigrants, non-citizens, and legal immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated, convicted, or arrested for crimes than native-born Americans are. \n\nThe Washington Post compiled statistical charts that indicate the Trump administration is lying when they claim illegal immigration is a crisis.

{"author": "Account235", "body": "Yes, yes, we all know by now that everyone who opposes the imperial war machine in any way is both a Russian agent and an antisemite. Jeremy Corbyn knows it, Ilhan Omar knows it, we all know it.\n\nThis one\u2019s been around a while, ever since headlines blared in 2011 that Assange had complained of a \u201cJewish conspiracy\u201d against him after an account of a conversation by Private Eye editor Ian Hislop. Assange responded to this claim as follows:\n\n    \u201cHislop has distorted, invented or misremembered almost every significant claim and phrase. In particular, \u2018Jewish conspiracy\u2019 is completely false, in spirit and in word. It is serious and upsetting. Rather than correct a smear, Mr. Hislop has attempted, perhaps not surprisingly, to justify one smear with another in the same direction. That he has a reputation for this, and is famed to have received more libel suits in the UK than any other journalist as a result, does not mean that it is right. WikiLeaks promotes the ideal of \u2018scientific journalism\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200awhere the underlaying evidence of all articles is available to the reader precisely in order to avoid these type of distortions. We treasure our strong Jewish support and staff, just as we treasure the support from pan-Arab democracy activists and others who share our hope for a just world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe treasure our strong Jewish support and staff.\u201d Man, what a Nazi.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t what cemented this smear into public consciousness. Two related events punched that ticket, and bear with me here:\n\nThe first event was the WikiLeaks account tweeting and then quickly deleting the following in July 2016: \u201cTribalist symbol for establishment climbers? Most of our critics have 3 (((brackets around their names))) &amp; have black-rim glasses. Bizarre.\u201d The triple brackets are what\u2019s known as echoes, which are a symbol that antisemites often put around words and names to hatefully indicate Jewishness in online discourse. In 2016 some Jewish people began putting the triple brackets around their own names on social media as a way of pushing back against this behavior, so if you really want to it\u2019s possible for you to interpret the tweet as saying \u2018All our critics are Jewish. Bizarre.\u2019\n\nBut does that make sense? Does it make sense for the guy who announced \u201cWe treasure our strong Jewish support and staff\u201d to then go making openly antisemitic comments? And if he really did suddenly decide to let the world know that he believes there\u2019s a Jewish conspiracy against WikiLeaks, why would he delete it? What\u2019s the theory there? That he was like \u201cOh, I just wanted to let everyone know about my Jewish conspiracy theory, but it turns out people get offended when an account with millions of followers says things like that\u201d? That makes no sense.\n\nIf you look at the account\u2019s other tweets at the time, it becomes clear that its operator was actually just trying to communicate an obscure, subtle point that was completely unsuitable for a massive international audience and 140 characters. When a user responded to the tweet before it was deleted explaining that some Jewish people now put triple brackets around their names to push back against antisemitism, the account responded, \u201cYes, but it seems to have been repurposed for something else entirely\u200a\u2014\u200aa wanna be establishment in-group designator.\u201d When accused of antisemitism by another account, WikiLeaks responded, \u201cThe opposite. We criticised the misappropriation of anti-Nazi critiques by social climbers. Like Ice Bucket Challenge &amp; ALS.\u201dIt looks clear to me that whoever was running the WikiLeaks Twitter account that day was clumsily trying to communicate an overly complicated idea about \u201csocial climbers\u201d and establishment loyalism, then deleted the tweet when they realized they\u2019d screwed up and stumbled into a social media land mine.\n\nNow, I say \u201cwhoever was running the WikiLeaks Twitter account that day\u201d because it\u2019s been public knowledge for years that @WikiLeaks is a staff account shared by multiple people. Here\u2019s a tweet of the account saying \u201cthis is a staff account, not Assange.\u201d Here\u2019s a tweet of the account saying \u201c@WikiLeaks is a shared staff account.\u201d This became self-evidently true for all to see when Assange\u2019s internet access was cut off by the Ecuadorian embassy for the first time in October 2016, but the WikiLeaks Twitter account kept making posts during that time without interruption. This takes us to the second event which helped cement the antisemitism smear.\n\nThe second event occurred in February 2018 when The Intercept\u2019s Micah Lee, who has had a personal beef with WikiLeaks and Assange for years, published a ghastly article which made the following assertion:\n\n    \u201cThroughout this article, The Intercept assumes that the WikiLeaks account is controlled by Julian Assange himself, as is widely understood, and that he is the author of the messages, referring to himself in the third person majestic plural, as he often does.\u201d\n\nThere is absolutely no reason for Lee to have made this assumption, and the fact that this remains uncorrected in his original article is journalistic malpractice.\n\nThe article reveals Twitter DMs from a group chat of which the WikiLeaks account was a member. One of the other accounts in the group chat shared a tweet by journalist Raphael Satter, who was posting a smear piece he\u2019d written about WikiLeaks. The WikiLeaks account responded as follows:\n\n    \u201cHe\u2019s always ben [sic] a rat.\u201d\n\n    \u201cBut he\u2019s jewish and engaged with the ((())) issue.\u201d\n\nWhen I first read about this exchange as written down by Micah Lee, I read it as \u201cHe\u2019s always been a rat, but then, he is Jewish, and engaged with the ((())) issue.\u201d Which would of course be gross. Calling someone a rat because they\u2019re Jewish would obviously be antisemitic. But if you read the DMs, whoever was running the account didn\u2019t do that; they said \u201cHe\u2019s always ben a rat,\u201d followed by a full stop, then beginning a new thought.\n\nNow if you look at the date on that exchange and compare it to the date on the deleted ((())) tweet, you\u2019ll see that this was one month after the infamous ((())) tweet that had caused such a tizzy. It appears likely to me that the operator of the account (who again could have been any of the WikiLeaks staff who had access to it) was saying that Satter was mad about \u201cthe ((())) issue\u201d, meaning the tweet so many people were so recently enraged about and were still discussing, hence his attacking them with a smear piece.\n\nThere are also claims about an association between Assange and the controversial Israel Shamir, which WikiLeaks denies unequivocally, saying in a statement:\n\n    Israel Shamir has never worked or volunteered for WikiLeaks, in any manner, whatsoever. He has never written for WikiLeaks or any associated organization, under any name and we have no plan that he do so. He is not an \u2018agent\u2019 of WikiLeaks. He has never been an employee of WikiLeaks and has never received monies from WikiLeaks or given monies to WikiLeaks or any related organization or individual. However, he has worked for the BBC, Haaretz, and many other reputable organizations.\n\n    It is false that Shamir is \u2018an Assange intimate\u2019. He interviewed Assange (on behalf of Russian media), as have many journalists. He took a photo at that time and has only met with WikiLeaks staff (including Asssange) twice. It is false that \u2018he was trusted with selecting the 250,000 US State Department cables for the Russian media\u2019 or that he has had access to such at any time.\n\n    Shamir was able to search through a limited portion of the cables with a view to writing articles for a range of Russian media. The media that subsequently employed him did so of their own accord and with no intervention or instruction by WikiLeaks.\n\nNow, we\u2019re on Smear #16. There\u2019s still a ways to go. If you\u2019ve been reading this article straight through it should be obvious to you by now that there\u2019s a campaign to paint Assange as literally the worst person in the world by calling him all the worst things you can possibly call someone. Is it possible that he\u2019s some kind of secret Jew hater? Sure, theoretically, but there\u2019s certainly no good argument to be made for that based on the facts at hand, and given the extent the narrative shapers are going to to paint him in a negative light, it\u2019s a mighty big stretch in my opinion.", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "france", "date_year_month": "2019-05", "created_utc_converted": "2019-05-24 14:01:33", "score_overall": 19, "words": "jewish conspiracy jewish conspiracy libel jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish conspiracy jewish conspiracy jewish jewish jewish jewish jew", "shared_words": "jewish conspiracy libel jew", "socre_distint": 4}

The atrocities of the Allies were more brutal, painful, mortal and numerous than the most extreme allegations made against the Germans.

Or for that matter, their alliance with the Palestinian Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al-Husseini, as proof of them being the original Palestinian nationalists.\n\nThe Nazis just wanted the Jews out of the country at that point, to break the Jewish boycott, and get the money from the Jews that fled the country. The Zionists wanted, and indeed succeeded in, saving thousands of Jewish lives. There was never any support for Zionism as a movement, support for the idea of an actual Jewish state, let alone support for it as a legitimate final solution to the \"Jewish question\".\n\nThere's a whole [thread debunking this myth in AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4h45ia/the_ken_livingstone_what_was_hitlers_relation_to/).

Marsden\" that I presume explains they're a forgery.\n\nBut Amazon has \"Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion Paperback \u2013 February, 2011\"  (dunno how to strip out the link crap that probably identifies me to some degree) that looks like it plays it straight: \n\n&gt;Freemasons and Zionist Jews everywhere screamed and complained that these 24 Protocols are a hoax, a forgery, even a blood taint against the Jews. But then came the brutal and barbaric Communist Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and its captive republics, led by covert Masonic Jews\u2014Lenin, Trotsky, Kaganovich, and others. The cruel and sinister crimes of the crypto Jew revolutionaries seemed to have jumped off the pages of the Protocols. [...]\n\n\n.\n\n\n&gt;**Note from Amazon**\n\n&gt;Amazon does not endorse The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. This book is one of the most infamous, and tragically influential, examples of racist propaganda ever written. It may be useful to some as a tool in the teaching of the history of anti-Semitism, but it's unquestionably propaganda.\n\n&gt;Does Amazon sell this book? We do, along with millions of other titles. The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion is classified under \"controversial knowledge\" in our store, along with books about UFOs, demonic possession, and all manner of conspiracy theories. You can also find books in other sections of Amazon's online bookstore that analyze The Protocols' fraudulent origins and its tragic historical role in promoting anti-Semitism and Jewish persecution, including A Lie and a Libel: The History of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. As a bookseller, Amazon strongly believes that providing open access to written speech, no matter how hateful or ugly, is one of the most important things we do. And because we think the best remedy for offensive speech is more speech, we also make available to readers the ability to make their own voices heard and express their views about this and all our titles in reviews and ratings.\n\nMan, you go down a friggin' weird rabbit hole in the related books...\n\nBack to \"Culture of Critique\", that looks to me (from the reviews of A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy) like the sort of thing I'd expect out of this Subreddit: a bloodless academic look at a hot-button culture war topic that's going to scare a lot of people and maybe embolden &amp; encourage some nasty people, but potentially true and interesting taken on its own. \n\n[looks for takes on it in SSC-sphere]\n\nHmm, generally pretty negative, people saying he's anti-semitic.\n\nScott himself in a links post:\n\n&gt;Nathan Cofnas [debunks Kevin MacDonald\u2019s anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-018-9310-x) Interesting not so much because I expect many people to believe Kevin MacDonald\u2019s anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, but because an attempt to disprove anti-Semitism on the merits got published in a journal and was generally-well-received, and because it shows the way that careful and intelligent study of group differences can be used to fight racism (the argument is basically \u201cJews\u2019 success in various fields is as we would predict from their IQs, so there\u2019s no need to posit any conspiracy theory\u201d). I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a good way to debunk these kinds of conspiracy theories without citing this research, which is one reason I become so concerned when people try to suppress it.\n\nOn looking a bit more, it looks like that third book (Culture of Critique) is the objectionable one. \n\nEpistemic Status: very limited knowledge of the factual claims made in these books, let alone their accuracy, also limited knowledge of how the alt-right is using them, also unsure about ethics of this discussion.\n\nKind of gets at the heart of this sub actually.

{"author": "millenialprincess", "body": "Being Jewish isnt a separate race, we are part of the human race just like you. We are a religion and are made up of slightly different but extremely different closely related ethnic groups. Genetically, Ashkenazim score somewhere between Sicilians (a southern european population that is heavily genetically levantine) and Cypriots (basically levantines). Other Jews score mostly as levantine and mixed with their host population (Iraqi Jews mixed with Mesopotamian populations, Libyan jews mixed with berbers to some extent, etc). There is a lot of overlap with all of our groups, genetically. Are Ashkenazi Jews a european group? Hell no. Not related to their host country. Im basically a Polish Jew yet most people ask me if Im Lebanese or Sephardi (Jews from Spain or Portugal) or even Persian Jewish, which shows that we can still pass as middle eastern even though we have slightly elevated levels of northern european and eastern european than other Jews have (see Jeff Goldblum or Oded Fehr). Mainland Greeks are still more closely related to eastern europeans than Ashkenazi Jews are, just to put things into perspective. \n\nTo sum up the beef white people have against us, we have feelings and wants just like everyone else and we have the ambition and drive to get what we want. Some of us are extremely brilliant, which scares white people. There\u2019s no zionist conspiracy to control the media. Yes, Jews are in the media, since non Jews didnt let immigrant Jewish workers take off on sabbath, Jews had to find a new outlet of work. This became hollywood and movie studios (ex: Warner Bros). \n\nJews got into banking because (at least in europe) Jews couldnt own land and christians couldnt charge interest on loans for each other but Jews have no prohibition against charging interest on loans to non Jews. Jews had to basically join the merchant class of people. Jews in the middle east and north africa also became merchants and bankers. It basically became our trade. Some banks are owned by Jews like Goldman Sachs or Safra bank but I have no personal ownership haha (I wish). \n\nJews dont eat non jewish babies\u2019 blood.
