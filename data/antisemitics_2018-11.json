Rumors of Jews killing Christian children and drinking their blood are known as blood libel myths and took off in medieval times. Basically Jews were shunned and forced into their own tightly knit communities and formed distinctive cultures separate from gentiles. This made a lot of ignorant peasants upset as they thought those Jews were up to no good and their otherness was seen as a threat, leading to pogroms. In more modern times, starting in the 19th century, race theorists proclaimed Jews an inferior race, eventually leading to Hitler, Nazism, and the Holocaust. \n\nCauses\n\nAntisemitism has been explained in terms of\u00a0racism,\u00a0xenophobia,\u00a0projected guilt, displaced aggression, and the search for a\u00a0scapegoat. Some explanations assign partial blame to the perception of Jewish people as unsociable. Such a perception may have arisen by many Jews having strictly kept to their own communities, with their own practices and laws.\n\nIt has also been suggested that parts of antisemitism arose from a perception of Jewish people as greedy (as often used in\u00a0stereotypes of Jews), and this perception has probably evolved in Europe during Medieval times where a large portion of\u00a0money lending\u00a0was operated by Jews.

{"archived": false, "author": "rewboss", "body": "Short answer: Propaganda and history.\n\nIn history, Jews formed a distinct ethnic group. They didn't generally look different, but they had different lifestyles, different traditions, and a different religion.\n\nJews were historically always treated with suspicion: after all, \"Jews\" had caused Jesus to be crucified, and hadn't accepted Jesus as the Messiah. In mediaeval times, they were often kept apart from the Christian population by being made to live in ghettos -- there are some cities (Hanau in Germany, the birthplace of the Brothers Grimm, is an example) where you can still see parts of the ghetto wall.\n\nIn gets worse. In those days, it was common for there to be a ban on Christians charging interest, meaning that Christians couldn't be moneylenders or bankers (without going bankrupt very quickly). That was left to the Jews, who were then seen as unfairly enriching themselves at the expense of their Christian \"superiors\". (If you've ever wondered why so many financiers have Jewish surnames, that's why.) You can see this in Shakespeare's play *The Merchant of Venice*, when Antonio has to go to the Jew Shylock to get a loan -- but Antonio is an antisemite, a fact that Shylock finds supremely ironic (\"You call me a misbeliever, cut-throat dog, / And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine, / And all for use of that which is mine own. / Well then, it now appears you need my help...\").\n\nSo, it's mistrust on religious grounds, plus resentment at how they're able to make money.\n\nAll of this made them a common scapegoat whenever things went wrong. They were frequently blamed for the Black Death, for example: in Strasbourg, 2,000 Jews were burned alive in a single day, for example. In Frankfurt, the Fettmilch Uprising was originally a protest against economic mismanagement by the patricians of the city, but spilled over into an all-out attack on the Jewish ghetto.\n\nBasically, antisemitism has a very, very long history.\n\nThe Nazi persecutions were just the most famous recent manifestions of this basic resentment. Hitler had a deep-seated and basically irrational hatred of Jews, and this formed the basis of many of his political views.\n\nAt the time, things were really rough in Germany. There was the humiliation of the loss of WW1, the economic turmoil caused by war reparations and the Great Depression, and political instability (with governments collapsing at frequent intervals, sometimes more than once in a year).\n\nHitler did what people had done generations ago, and used the Jews as a convenient scapegoat: he accused them of causing Germany to lose the war in a bit of propaganda known as [the Stab-in-the-Back legend](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Stab-in-the-back_postcard.jpg).", "score": 17, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "date_year_month": "2018-11", "created_utc_converted": "2018-11-04 14:52:30", "score_overall": 7, "words": "jewish merchant jew jewish scapegoat jewish scapegoat", "shared_words": "jewish merchant jew scapegoat", "socre_distint": 4}

{"archived": false, "author": "RussiaWillFail", "body": "You're asking a very difficult question that most likely goes back about 2300 years and getting to the heart of the answer basically requires looking at Judaism and Christianity the same way we look at Roman and Egyptian religions.\n\nThe long and the short of it is that Judaism most likely emerged during the period of civil wars in Canaan, prior to the Roman occupation of Judea. One of the Kingdoms inside Canaan took the Babylonian lesser God of War Yahweh as their patron deity and declared him as the one true God. That Kingdom then went on to win the most civil wars in the region, solidifying their religious doctrine as being dominant in the region. Out of this history emerged Judaism.\n\nThe history of antisemitism is most likely a combination of antipathy toward the ruling monotheistic Jews in Canaan from the subjugated pagan polytheists and general xenophobia in Rome once they conquered Judea, where most in Judea and Canaan were seen as disobedient barbarians due to multiple military rebellions against the Roman conquest and occupation. Rome saw this antipathy as offensive from what they considered a lower society and persecuted Jews in retribution, targeting their religion as the Jewish populations were too spread out to target effectively militarily.\n\nThis general xenophobia, antipathy and superiority complex in Rome spread with the Roman Empire and was communicated to virtually all Roman principalities where Jewish members of the Empire emigrated to.\n\nNow, modern conspiracy theories toward Jews can be traced back to the revolutions in Europe in the 18th 19th centuries, particularly in America, France and Russia. It really is hard to communicate to people in the modern era how terrifying the late 1700s were for Europeans. They watched as the most powerful military forces in the world were repelled by guerrillas in America and their own proletariat executing the aristocracy in France. This led to a period of great instability in the following decades and fear that the entire world order of European dominance through religion and aristocracy was on the verge of collapse. Combine this with the explosion of the printing press and an uptick in literacy and voila, you have the perfect conditions for some good old fashioned conspiracy theories to spread.\n\nThere were countless conspiracies spread across Europe about what caused the American and French Revolutions. Everything from secret societies (it's around this time that the original Illuminati conspiracy was invented, but that's a whole other story) to the Jews were blamed for the turgid conditions that Europeans were living in. The Enlightenment movement in Europe had also begun to spread to other countries such as Bavaria, Poland, and Germania leading to massive new movements demanding parliamentary representation of the people. More conspiracies were fueled.\n\nWe now get to the point of Russian relevance. Following Catherine the Great's lifting of Russia out from European irrelevance (yet another major force of destabilization in the late 1700s), into a force of nature in European politics, the Russian aristocracy suffered a number of rulers that sent the country rubber-banding between liberal and conservative reforms that crippled Russian influence globally and made the establishment of parliamentary representation almost impossible due to aristocratic hand-wringing and slavish devotion to an autocrat paralyzing the Russian state and making modernization impossible in the 18th century. This paralysis created mass paranoia among the Russian aristocracy and is one of the chief influences in Russia failing to act quickly enough with its European allies to avert World War I. But the main bit we want to focus on is the turmoil inside Russia that led to the Bolshevik Revolution.\n\nPrior to Russia's devastation in World War I, the Russian economy had been left stagnating by the failure to modernize. The proletariat of Russia was deeply unhappy and rebellions had been fomenting for decades, particularly in response to the failure of the Russian state to implement parliamentary representation for the people. The Russian Aristocracy, deeply embedded with the Russian Orthodox Church at this point in history, needed something to distract the proletariat- something to take the blame. So the Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian Secret Police organized together and wrote a book called \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\". It is a book plagiarized from popular French conspiracy thrillers from the early 19th century combined with every single Jewish conspiracy theory that had been floating around Europe for the previous 2000 years, all collected into one loose, nonsensical conspiracy about Jews running the world for nefarious purposes. It was released with the intention to scapegoat Russian Jews into being blamed for the problems of the Russian State.\n\nObviously, we know this didn't work and following World War I the Bolshevik Revolution led to the assassination of Nicholas II and the end of the rule of the Russian aristocracy under Lenin's Communist Party. However, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion spread out of Russia and across Europe, becoming a bestseller and influencing a young Bavarian soldier by the name of Adolf Hitler, whom was introduced to the book by a number of German Nationalists that were cultivating him to be their public voice. He would go on to use that book to inform Mein Kampf, referencing the book directly by name. As Hitler rose in power, so did his spread of the Protocols into German society, fueling the spread of the book worldwide, leading to the book becoming a bestseller in both Europe *and America*.\n\nThis crystalized the modern form of antisemitism about Jews controlling the banks and the media that we all know today.", "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "politics", "date_year_month": "2018-11", "created_utc_converted": "2018-11-05 16:45:26", "score_overall": 11, "words": "jewish jewish conspiracy conspiracy illuminati conspiracy conspiracy jewish conspiracy conspiracy scapegoat", "shared_words": "jewish conspiracy illuminati scapegoat", "socre_distint": 4}

They know that pointing the finger directly at Jews isn\u2019t politically palatable, so they dog whistle in a way that can speak directly to their supporters and attract new ones.\n\nThis is the antisemitism of the alt-right, the antisemitism is the shooter, the antisemitism of Trump, the antisemitism of Hitler, and increasingly of mainstream Republicans\n\nThe shooter attacked the synagogue because he believed it was an instrument of George Soros and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Service to bring in the Honduran caravan to weaken white people amd advance the position of \u201cglobalists\u201d (or what Nazis call \u2018the internal Jew\u2019), a conspiracy theory that Trump shares\n\nTrump\u2019s antisemitism however present differently Han the shooters because Trump has no underlying values except self preservation and self promotion. So when Trump goes to the Republican Jewish Committee and tells them (as he did in 2016) \u2018you people are just like me, you love money) he is showing his belief in this conspiracy theory but devoid of the extermination component the Nazis has because he sees certain Jews as a tool he can use for himself.

Communists were always the actual geopolitical enemy, Jew's were just an obvious scapegoat that could be wrapped up into the whole global conspiracy against Germany.  \n\n\n\" Communist revolutions and movements were spreading all over Europe, destroying churches, authority, killing the rich and the nobility, involved in terrible crimes and a massive civil war that killed millions in Russia, before setting up the USSR that went on to kill millions more in often arbitrary violence and mass starvation, ect. Not many people know this, but there was a communist revolution in Bavaria and a short lived Bavarian People's Republic. Bavaria would later go on to vote heavily for the Nazi Party. The country was literally being torn apart between anarchists, communists, socialist, liberals, conservatives, monarchists, fascists, ect. Then along comes Hitler and co. who literally fight communists in the streets, form a party, and promise to save the country (and all of Europe) from global Communism. It also helps that's many prominant communists like Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, ect. were Jews. It is a hallmark of fascist to have an ambiguous and ill defined enemy that is at the same time weak and strong, which became a global Jewish-Communist-Capitalist conspiracy that controlled the world and wanted to keep the German race weak and down. (See the \"Q anon\" movement in the USA for a recent example of how this garbage works). I am also going to note here that although Jews suffered horribly under the Nazi's and their experiance deserves the upmost respect, they were not the only people to go through the camps. An even greater number (although far less proportionally to total population) of communists, physically and mentally handicapped, socialists, gypsies, feminists, homosexuals, ect. were killed in the Holocaust.

A lot of countries have conscription, but in recent history pretty much only the japs and the nazis did it to the nations they occupied. Especially on such a scale.\n\n&gt;korea was annexed not occupied\n\nThat's the same thing though because koreans were coerced into it. The korean monarch even refused to sign it. You can't say it was legal when it was based on that 1905 treaty that was signed following the withdrawal of the russian influence in the region while the korean palace was occupied by the imperial japanese soldiers and there were japanese troops stationed in key locations throughout korea.

This does seem questionable actually as Oxytetracycline was patented only in 1950. Doesn't mean anything though. Arsphenamine is a syphilis treatment drug that along with antibiotics was used to contain the spread of venerical diseases from the japanese soldiers.

A common start of an antisemitic riot or porgrom was the idea of blood libel where after somebody(usually a child) had gone missing or been murdered that local Jews had killed the child to harvest their blood to make matzo with. \n\nThere was always also an economic incentive to anti-Jewish violence in that property could be looted, but Jews also held a distinct place in European society in regards to finance in that charging interest on loans for forbidden for Christians because it was the sin of usury.

This just reeks of desperation on your part.\n\nFirstly of all, the Koch brothers aren't Jewish. Secondly, there are no wild conspiracy about how the Koch's stand behind everything the left doesn't like. The things that usually are criticized are things that are proven facts. For example the Koch's financing right wing shill Dave Rubin. Or how they spent millions to boost the Tea party movement. Those are proven facts.\n\nIf people say things about Soros that are true, there is no problem, for example Soros gives moneys to \"black lives matter\" that's not a conspiracy theory. But they don't just say that, they make up crazy conspiracy theories about Soros being behind the caravan or Soros paying all the women to protest on the women's march. Those are conspiracy theories, not facts, there's a difference, you don't seem to understand it.\n\nAnd when the left rails against money in politics, like the Koch's money, they're also against Soros' money in politics. The Young Turks for example have stated that countless times.\n\n&gt;American citizens have been killed by illegal immigrants, that is a fact. I know that some of you are willing to turn a blind eye to these crimes for your perceived 'greater good' but a lot of us aren't.\n\nAnd American citizens have been killed by native born citizens. Illegal immigrants are more law abiding than native born citizens, so this crime panic doesn't make any sense. Also the caravan wasn't a real danger at all by any sane measurement.\n\nThis was an insane rhetoric by the right and it most likely had an impact on this Pittsburgh shooter.\n\nIt's also a misnomer to talk about \"illegal immigrants\" here, since these people wanted to come in legally.\n\n&gt;The most heinous part is that you are talking as though Trump was talking about Soros' 'jewishness'.\n\nNo, the most heinous part is that you think it's not antisemitic if people have crazy conspiracy theories about how Soros, a rich Jew, is financing a \"allegedly\" extremely dangerous migrant caravan; a *\"foreign invasion\" \"an illegal alien mob,\u201d \u201can attack on America\u201d,* and George Soros, a Jew, is allegedly behind it. The fact that you're not capable to detect the antisemitism here does speak poorly of you.\n\n&gt;This is typical left wing bullshit where you get to just call something out as a dog whistle and expect everyone else to follow your lead.\n\nSo funny, since it's literally the right who constantly calls the left antisemitic when they criticize Israel. Constantly.\n\nBen Shaprio, one of the rights leading \"intellectuals\" for example has a definition of antisemitism that includes pretty much every person on the left and even most Jews, since 70% of them vote left. He called them \"Jews in Name Only\". He called Obama an \"antisemitic son of a bitch\", \"second Holocaust incentivizing\", his administration a \"Jew hating administration\", his chief of staff a \"Kapo\".\n\nHe called the liberal Jewish advocacy group \"J-Street\" antisemitic!\n\nSo please; spare me ...\n\nAnd you know what's the difference?  Antisemitism researcher would absolutely agree with me and the NYT that the conspiracy theories around Soros are to a large degree antisemitic. However, they would never agree with Shapiro's definition according to which Obama is antisemitic because of the Iran-Deal, or people who support the Iran Deal. Or that Obama is antisemitic at all.\n\n&gt;If you don't have any solid evidence to say that Trump was criticising Soros as a jew then shut the fuck up about it.\n\nI said he gave rise to the conspiracy theory, it's completely irrelevant whether he's antisemitic himself. He's giving support to antisemitic conspiracy theories. You're straight up nuts if you think you're somehow excused if you're not antisemitic yourself, which I don't know whether he is.\n\n&gt;You're just adding more conspiracies to the mix. Trump's son in law is jewish as is his daughter and grandchildren.\n\nAnd he also used antisemitic stereotypes when he spoke in front of Jewish Republicans. Again I didn't say he's antisemitic, I don't know whether he is, but the conspiracy theory is antisemitic and he gave weight to it, gave support. It's completely irrelevant whether he's antisemitic himself. And just to be clear; some of the greatest antisemites in history had Jewish people that they loved. Even Hitler had a \"noble Jew\", that's how he called him, Doctor Bloch, whom he spared from the Holocaust.\n\n&gt;Tell me, who do you think has done more good for the jews. Obama or Trump?\n\nObama gave them the Iron Dome, that gave enormous protection for Jews living in Israel, plus enormous financial aid, more than any previous presidents. The Iran deal I considered to be a good thing, and the annulment a bad thing by Trump. Also, he was respectful of minorities and a society like that is much more safe for Jews. That's why when Trump was elected hate crime in general and antisemitic hate crimes spiked.\n\nSo therefore, without any question; Obama. But this is not the topic here, and I'm not going to debate this with you.\n\n&gt;*She wouldn't have done damage by nominating liberal judges, nor by restricting gun rights.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Changing the very foundations and principles of the United States is causing damage.

His fictional and his non-fictional works repeated antisemitic stereotypes of Jewish greed, usury, capitalism, bolshevism, cowardice, disloyalty and secrecy (each of these stereotypes are\u00a0examined in detail in my recent book, [*Chesterton\u2019s Jews*](https://simonmayers.com/chestertons-jews/)).\n\nHere's a direct quotes from Chesterton about Jewish people\n\n&gt;He suggested that a comparison may be made between \u201cGipsey pilfering\u201d \\[[9](https://simonmayers.com/2013/12/09/g-k-chesterton-and-the-stereotype-of-the-greedy-jew/#CSGJ1)\\] and \u201cJewish usury.\u201d Both \u201craces,\u201d he observed, \u201care in different ways landless, and therefore in different ways lawless.\u201d\n\nFor some reason you seem to think that his conflation of Judaism with Hitlerism was not related to his already existing anti-semitism. \n\nI mean, given that you previously accused me of making associations that weren't there I'm not sure what you think you're actually doing at this point.", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "JordanPeterson", "date_year_month": "2018-11", "created_utc_converted": "2018-11-08 19:28:25", "score_overall": 9, "words": "jewish jewish jewish jewish greed cowardice jewish jew jewish", "shared_words": "jewish greed cowardice jew", "socre_distint": 4}

But it's very unlikely that this crime would have happened without the extreme rhetoric and conspiracy theories coming from the mainstream right, like Fox News and Republican politicians.\n\nIf you can't provide a direct connection then your hypothesizing means nothing.\n\n&gt; It's not an opinion piece, it's a \"news analysis\", it says so on the top of the article.\n\nIts editorialized drivel. Give the facts, not your opinion.\n\n&gt; No, it's not rich of me. This just reeks of desperation on your part.\n\nFirstly of all, the Koch brothers aren't Jewish. Secondly, there are no wild conspiracy about how the Koch's stand behind everything the left doesn't like. The things that usually are criticized are things that are proven facts. For example the Koch's financing right wing shill Dave Rubin. Or how they spent millions to boost the Tea party movement. Those are proven facts.\n\nIf people say things about Soros that are true, there is no problem, for example Soros gives moneys to \"black lives matter\" that's not a conspiracy theory. But they don't just say that, they make up crazy conspiracy theories about Soros being behind the caravan or Soros paying all the women to protest on the women's march. Those are conspiracy theories, not facts, there's a difference, you don't seem to understand it.\n\nAnd when the left rails against money in politics, like the Koch's money, they're also against Soros' money in politics. The Young Turks for example have stated that countless times.\n\n&gt;Its about talking as though they are destroying America. Do you not think that the left has vilified the koch brothers, really? \n\nYou want to look at conspiracy theories? I just typed 'koch brothers racism' in to google and these were some of the top results.\n\n&gt; https://www.theroot.com/millions-of-students-are-quietly-being-taught-the-koch-1823742091\n\n&gt; https://www.thenation.com/article/how-charles-koch-is-helping-neo-confederates-teach-college-students/\n\nYou portray them as evil puppeteers orchestrating the downfall of America.\n\n&gt; And American citizens have been killed by native born citizens. Illegal immigrants are more law abiding than native born citizens, so this crime panic doesn't make any sense. Also the caravan wasn't a real danger at all by any sane measurement.\n\nOh so its okay for illegals to kill Americans because other Americans are already doing that. Great logic you have there. Why stop potential murderers if there are already murderers.\n\n&gt; No, the most heinous part is that you think it's not antisemitic if people have crazy conspiracy theories about how Soros, a rich Jew, is financing a \"allegedly\" extremely dangerous migrant caravan; a \"foreign invasion\" \"an illegal alien mob,\u201d \u201can attack on America\u201d, and George Soros, a Jew, is allegedly behind it. The fact that you're not capable to detect the antisemitism here does speak poorly of you.\n\nShow me exactly where Trump mentioned his 'jewishness'. If you can't then you are a proven liar.\n\n&gt; So funny, since it's literally the right who constantly calls the left antisemitic when they criticize Israel. Constantly.\n\n&gt; Ben Shaprio, one of the rights leading \"intellectuals\" for example has a definition of antisemitism that includes pretty much every person on the left and even most Jews, since 70% of them vote left. He called them \"Jews in Name Only\". He called Obama an \"antisemitic son of a bitch\", \"second Holocaust incentivizing\", his administration a \"Jew hating administration\", his chief of staff a \"Kapo\".\n\n&gt; He called the liberal Jewish advocacy group \"J-Street\" antisemitic!\n\n&gt; So please; spare me ...\n\n&gt; And you know what's the difference? Antisemitism researcher would absolutely agree with me and the NYT that the conspiracy theories around Soros are to a large degree antisemitic. However, they would never agree with Shapiro's definition according to which Obama is antisemitic because of the Iran-Deal, or people who support the Iran Deal. Or that Obama is antisemitic at all.\n\nIts the amount you call out Israel relative to every other country in the region. If you want to boycott Israel but think that we should be trading with Iran then you are an anti-semite. Making deals with a regime that has made it abundantly clear that they want to wipe Israel off the face of the map is the clearest sign one can have of anti-semitism. Coming up with every excuse under the sun as to why Hamas shoots rockets at Israel and the PLO pays the families of terrorists is anti-semitism. When you align yourself with people who make it clear that they don't even think Israel should have the right to exist you show your anti-semitism. Also, who cares if 70% of american jews vote left? How many of those 70% are jewish in any sense other than ancestry? If you don't go to synagogue or wear a yarmulke the risk of violence against you is tiny.\n\n&gt; I said he gave rise to the conspiracy theory, it's completely irrelevant whether he's antisemitic himself. He's giving support to antisemitic conspiracy theories. You're straight up nuts if you think you're somehow excused if you're not antisemitic yourself, which I don't know whether he is.\n\nYet you have no actual evidence for this other than your perceived dog whistle. Who has benefited the jewish people more? \n\n&gt; Obama gave them the Iron Dome, that gave enormous protection for Jews living in Israel, plus enormous financial aid, more than any previous presidents.\n\nNo, he simply gave approval. It doesn't mean much when he ensured that the Israelis will have to be shooting that thing in perpetuity because Obamaallied himself with the very people who encourage terrorist attacks to be carried out on Israel i.e. Abbas.\n\n&gt; The Iran deal I considered to be a good thing, and the annulment a bad thing by Trump.\n\nOf course you do. And you will completely ignore the deal's role in Yemen as well. Who cares about shiite terrorism, right. Just blame the saudis for everything.\n\n&gt; Also, he was respectful of minorities and a society like that is much more safe for Jews. \n\nWhat a load of crap. Muslims LOOOOOVVVVVEEEE the jews don't they. The black Obama staffers that wrote \"death to jews\" on the synangogue walls the other week obviously love the jews. Most minorities don't even consider jews a minority simply because their skin colour is white.\n\n&gt; That's why when Trump was elected hate crime in general and antisemitic hate crimes spiked.\n\nYet it has been disproven that that hate crime is all coming from the right. Brooklyn specifically has had a huge rise in anti-semitic crimes that were confirmed to not be of right wing origin.\n\n&gt; You don't turn people into criminals if you say you can't buy or have this weapon anymore. It's an absurd statement. People can have other fire arms.\n\nIf you ban semi-automatics and the owner of that weapon refuses to give it up you make them a criminal.

For my entire childhood I looked upon them as fellow white people (and I'm not saying they *aren't* white people, it's just that, well, it was only earlier this year that I learned that \"Are Jews white\" is something that's been debated for a long time with white gentiles and Jews alike on both sides of the debate, rather than just some whitesuprem propaganda).

I don't see a difference between the liberal hatred of the Russians vs. neo-Nazi hatred of the Jews, except that the former seems to be infinitely more powerful right now.

Christians, religious right who \"care\" about Jews in the sense they want Israel to be in their hands. Thats the extent of it. Of course when their messiah comes and the rapture occurs, all these Jews will be left on the earthen hellscape to rot and those who die will be burning in hell for eternity, but hey, they consider themselves \"friends\" of the Jewish people. Newsflash: They are not friends of the Jewish people, and most Jews understand this. \n\n2. The non-religious right, the alt-right, etc. Almost all \"red pilling\" in these groups point to jews as being the ultimate evil. They want Jews dead, exterminated, eradicated. The MAGAbomber was antisemitic, and the synagogue shooter as well. Both also believed in Qanon. Qanon is virulently antisemitic (jews control the planet, globalism, etc) and we see countless images of Trump supporters at the hate rallies holding Qanon signs, wearing the shirts, chanting WWG1WGA. If you press any these lunatics, you will find they hate Jews. Because they are conspiracy theorists and the road all these right-wing conspiracies take is the same. They are no different than Sayoc. Remember the Unite the Right rally? Same thing, same caliber of people. Alt-right lunatics, incels, racists. All of them hate Jews. Not the \"we think Israel should relax its policies\" hatred, but instead the \"Israel should be nuked and jews should be exterminated\" type of hatred. By the way, all of this is supported by the Trump administration. Eric Jr goes on TV and says critics of Trump are earning their shekels, they hire antisemites throughout all levels of the administration, GOP representatives invite holocaust deniers (Matt Gaetz, Steve King, etc) to major events, they retweet white supremacists and racists constantly. On and on this goes. \n\n...\n\nThe right, both religious and non-religious, completely monopolize the groups that harbor REAL antisemitism. Most American Jews understand this and vote democrat for this reason. The right can go fuck itself.

{"archived": false, "author": "jericha", "body": "I am by no means an expert on genocide in general, but I\u2019ll do my best to answer your question, based on my (admittedly limited) understanding these issues. \n\nFirstly, I\u2019m American, and I\u2019m looking at this topic from that perspective, so to me the idea of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d is inextricably linked to white supremacists and Neo Nazis. In the US, factions of the far right legitimately believe, or at least claim to believe, that the political, economical and social dominance (or supremacy) of white people in our society, which has existed unchallenged since this country was founded, is being challenged and subverted by... honestly, I don\u2019t know. Black people, for sure, Jews who control the media and the so called \u201cdeep state\u201d and/or some sort of global cabal that is secretly running the world behind the scenes (George Soros, the Illuminati, which according to the conspiracy theory, was founded  by the Rothschild family in the 18th or 19th century, I\u2019m sure the list goes on), Hispanic immigrants, Muslims, you know, non-Caucasian/Aryan (in Nazi parlance) people. \n\nIn my mind, this movement, although certainly not a new phenomenon by any means, found allies in the people who started sounding the alarm about a supposed \u201cwar on Christianity\u201d during Obama\u2019s presidency (because apparently Obama is really a Muslim and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, hell bent on imposing sharia law in the US, which obviously didn\u2019t happen, so... see also: birtherism), which to me was nothing more than a racist dog whistle. While not all people who have bought into the \u201cwar on Christianity\u201d hysteria are neo Nazis or outspoken racists and bigots, \u201cwhite\u201d supremacy in the US really means \u201cwhite Christian\u201d supremacy. \n\nWhile American Jews (I can\u2019t speak to Jewish populations elsewhere) have largely assimilated and become more secular/less religious in their day to day lives (which may account for the confusion in your original comment), making them outwardly indistinguishable from the overall Caucasian population here, those who believe in and advocate for the supremacy of the white race do not view Jews as white/Caucasian, but as a separate ethnic group, due to the fact (I believe but am not 100% sure) that Jewish identity is passed down via bloodline from mothers to their children. While modern day white supremacy largely stems from the ideology of the Third Reich, anti-semitism has well documented history that began looooong before Hitler rose to power, by which point Jewish people had become a reliable scapegoat and target for those who wanted easy answers to their society\u2019s problems or their personal struggles (remember, Hitler rose to power in the decades after WWI, the aftermath of which had left Germany in chaos and decimated the region, to put it very simply). \n\nWhile there has always been a strong undercurrent of racism and bigotry in America, in the decades since the civil rights movement, white supremacists and their ilk have been slowly shunned and forced underground as our society became more diverse and previously repressed minorities started to exercise their rights and make their voices heard, culminating in the election of our first black president. Then Trump came along and stoked the ever simmering racial tension in the US for political gain, thus legitimizing white supremacists, giving them a voice and a platform, and empowering them to come out of the shadows, although the groundwork for this resurgence was laid prior to Trump announcing his candidacy. So if you\u2019ve been seeing the idea that a \u201cwhite genocide\u201d is occurring mentioned more frequently, that\u2019s probably why, imo. Also, to be clear, this is not unique to the US. Europe is also seeing a resurgence of \u201cnationalism\u201d in response to the arrival in recent years of migrants and refugees from the Middle East and Africa. \n\nAs far as genocide in general, from a global and historical perspective, to be honest, I\u2019m not sure I know enough to speak to that in any real depth. That being said, \u201cgenocide\u201d generally refers to one ethnic/racial/national/religious group claiming superiority and dominance over another and systematically attempting to wipe out the opposing, \u201cinferior\u201d group (in contrast to a dictator like Stalin, who was pretty indiscriminate about who he threw in the gulag and was more focused on wiping out the political opposition).  Can the two groups on opposing sides of genocide both be of the same race, from a purely genetic standpoint? Yes. But it often goes deeper than mere race, in that the side committing the genocide will find some trait or context that they use to define their enemies as \u201cother\u201d and, therefore, justify the genocide. \n\nFor example (to provide some very basic facts), in Bosnia, which I believe is what you were referring to when you mentioned Eastern Europe, Bosnian Serbs waged a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Bosnian Muslims, although I don\u2019t know enough about the ethnic and racial makeup of those two groups to speak to that point specifically. A better example might be the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, in which the Hutus slaughtered the Tutsi population and an estimated 500,000-1,000,000 Rwandans were killed, the majority of them Tutsis. From a western perspective, both groups may appear to be of the same race and ethnic background, but based on the history of both the region and the two groups, and according to those involved in perpetrating the genocide, the Hutus and Tutsis were, in fact, distinct racial groups. \n\nSo, to answer your question, genocide is not always white people vs ethnic or racial minorities,  but it\u2019s usually significantly more complicated than one race vs another, and the origins of a genocide are highly dependent on and influenced by the history of the region and the populations that live there. \n\nI hope that cleared some of this up for you.

The most prominent financier and mentor of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), which seized the government in 1908, was a Jewish banker of Italian origin from Salonica, Emmanuel Carasso.\n\nThe Turkish newspaper references the [\"Ottoman balfour declaration\"](http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/analysis/the-ottoman-balfour-declaration/2017/12/21/), signed by Talaat in 1918\n\n&gt;When Greeks, who had held a privileged status up until then, fell into disfavor after the Constantinople massacre of 1821 targetting Greeks, Jews were hoping for a second chance.\n\n&gt;However, with their art facilities scattered around Anatolia, Armenians came in first thanks to their capital surplus. As a result of the Jewish lobby's recommendations, the Young Turks government removed Armenians from Anatolia in 1915. Hence, the economy of the country was left in the hands of Jewish capital. **Carasso, who was a part of the committee that informed Abd\u00fclhamid II of his dethronement, was the closest confidant of Talat Pasha, the figure responsible for the deportation law. In fact, when Talat Pasha escaped abroad in 1918, he entrusted his entire estate to Carasso.** To take an active role in the foundation of the Ankara government, Carasso returned to his homeland before his death.\n\n\nWhats fascinating is that the Turkish piece seems to imply as if some nonexistent \"jewish conspiracy\" existed to genocide the armenians, rather than singling out the specific people involved.\n\nI don't think anyone needs to form some generalized bigotry against people of Jewish descent for the actions of a few people, and yet this idea is pushed by MSM too.\n\nTime of Israel did an article that strangely avoided any mention at all of Emmanual Carasso, bankers involved, and instead tries to scapegoat random Ottoman Jews as the perpetrators like this:\n\n\n[\"Before the Holocaust, Ottoman Jews supported the Armenian genocide\u2019s \u2018architect\u2019\"](https://www.timesofisrael.com/before-the-holocaust-ottoman-jews-supported-the-armenian-genocides-architect/)\n\n&gt;Before the Holocaust, Ottoman Jews supported the Armenian genocide\u2019s \u2018architect\u2019\n\n&gt;Author Hans-Lukas Kieser says a desperate Zionist press praised the empire even during the slaughter of its minority population, a murder which Israel continues to gloss over today\n\nWhile Emmanual Carasso could be considered a \"zionist sympathizer\" at most, most zionist groups had nothing to do with him.

He also championed a brand of anti-semitism that could only be thought up by a mind completely cut off from reality.\"[186] \n\n&gt;From the 1980s on, Fischer's comments about Jews were a major theme in his public and private remarks.[443] He openly denied the Holocaust, and called the United States \"a farce controlled by dirty, hook-nosed, circumcised Jew bastards\".[444] Between 1999 and 2006, Fischer's primary means of communicating with the public was radio interviews.

Fischer stated that he was happy that the airliner attacks had happened, while expressing his view on United States and Israeli foreign policy, saying \"I applaud the act. Look, nobody gets ... that the US and Israel have been slaughtering the Palestinians ... for years.\"[462][463][464][465] He also said \"The horrible behavior that the US is committing all over the world ... This just shows you, that what goes around, comes around even for the United States.\"[462][463] Fischer also referenced the movie Seven Days in May and said he hoped for a military coup d'\u00e9tat in the US, \"[I hope] the country will be taken over by the military\u2014they'll close down all the synagogues, arrest all the Jews, execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders.\"[466][467] In response to Fischer's statements about 9/11, the US Chess Federation passed a motion to cancel his right to membership in the organization.[468] Fischer's right to become a member was reinstated in 2007.[469]", "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "news", "date_year_month": "2018-11", "created_utc_converted": "2018-11-23 17:06:48", "score_overall": 8, "words": "holocaust jew jewish conspiracy jewish jew jewish jewish", "shared_words": "holocaust jew jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

I don't think you would have had a Trump without a lot of people being angry about seeing other anti-establishment candidates being smacked down or destroyed in the past. There's also the rules change in 2012 that ironically ended up helping Donald Trump in 2016 at the Republican National Convention, since they were such radically different kinds of candidates (in terms of electoral strategy).\n\nRand Paul hasn't been completely sycophantic, but I think that he's been a strong ally to the president on a lot of important issues, such as foreign policy with Russia. You have other strong libertarians in the House now such as Amash and Massie. So, I'm pretty satisfied. Ron Paul doesn't have to have had a strong legislative record to have made an impact in other ways, such as changing the culture (or the conservative movement).\n\nI don't particularly agree that Pat Buchanan is an anti-Semite or a racist. I think that the kinds of people who say that have the blood of tens of thousands of brown people on their hands, as well as thousands of young American patriots, and are responsible for taking away or limiting many of our constitutional rights, so it's hard for me to care about their opinions. \"I helped commit a genocide, but at least I'm not a *racist!*\" Buchanan has lots of Jewish colleagues that I'm aware of, such as Ron Unz or [Paul Gottfried](https://www.lewrockwell.com/1970/01/paul-gottfried/churchill-buchanan-and-the-neocons/), so he can't possibly be some kind of a vapid Jew-hater. Maybe those are just \"bad Jews\", but in that case, who's the real anti-Semites here?\n\nI don't think that Pat Buchanan or other paleocons like him are the equivalent of a man [who compares Jews to termites](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/techwatch/corinne-weaver/2018/10/17/farrakhan-calling-jewish-people-termites-not-twitter), but even pretending I accepted that were true, so what? I think it's still a valid question to ask why the Farrakhans of the right seem to be far more targeted and persecuted than the Farrakhans of the left. You cited earlier being worried about \"leftists thinking we are bigots\", but that is a good joke, as if there is anything you can do for leftists to stop calling us bigots. If the Jewish lobby and our alliance with Israel are really in the interests of the United States, then it is confusing why so-called \"anti-Semites\" of the right, who at least represent the traditional culture of the United States and the West and style themselves as America First, are far more persecuted and marginalized than the anti-Semites of the left, who hate the United States and everything she stands for, hates freedom, and does not even believe Israel has a right to exist because it's an apartheid state. It confuses people why the conservative, Christian white gentile, who have done such an admirable job of supporting and protecting Israel for the last 70 years, is treated as the greatest enemy *of the right* by our self-proclaimed allies, and this makes people feel taken advantage of. And why wouldn't it? That's basically being pissed on and told you should be thankful.\n\nWhen people on the right ask \"Why is our current relationship with Israel beneficial to America?\", they should be entitled to a facts-based, respectful response, not being targeted and smeared and attacked, fired from their jobs or expelled from schools, censored from social media, and called an anti-Semite or a Nazi who likes to see synagogue shootings. This isn't anti-Semitism or hatred of Jews for being Jews. These are valid, thoughtful questions, and if the relationship between conservative Jews and conservative gentiles was a healthy one, then we should be able to discuss it openly, not in the shadows. Who cares what you're afraid the left would call us. What seems unfair to a lot of people on the right is being told that we essentially have to put the interests of a foreign nation and a small minority above our own, at a time when the hatred, bigotry, and in some cases, *overt persecution* of white gentiles is [more normalized and mainstream](https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-public-college-offering-course-called-abolition-of-whiteness) than it ever has been in our memories. I could go into the weeds and demonstrate this at length, but it'd be easier if you just concede that anti-whiteness does exist and is a real phenomenon, since we're both conservatives. I understand that some mainstream Jewish conservatives do a decent job of shining a spotlight on this and arguing against it, such as Ben Shapiro, but on the other hand, when someone like Bill Kristol, the architect of the Iraq War, tweets that he's [extremely disappointed with his \"fellow white\" men over 55](https://twitchy.com/jacobb-38/2018/08/05/guys-its-officially-over-bill-kristol-is-not-happy-with-his-fellow-white-men-over-55/), I shouldn't have to feel like a bad person for noticing that he's a Jewish racist against white people. He should be considered the bad person for being a racist. Do you understand where I'm coming from here? You're so concerned about people like Ron Paul and Pat Buchanan being \"anti-Semites\" and \"insane conspiracy theorists\", or whatever, when in my opinion, there's a lot more nuance here surrounding these issues, and Jews need to be more willing to tolerate discussion about these issues or else there's going to be more problems. Do you think that there's any similarities between modern anti-whiteness and anti-Semitism, or is it heinous and anti-Semitic of me to even consider such comparisons?\n\nTo be clear, I'm not any kind of an Israel-hater or an anti-Semite. I think that that Israel is the greatest state in the Middle East, and I grew up with Jews on Long Island. I consider myself extraordinarily thoughtful about these issues and try to see both sides of any story. The list of things I *don't* know about Jewish power, Israeli-US relations, etc. is far greater than the list of things I do know, and I don't like to jump to conclusions and assume things that I don't have evidence for. I think I had a very philosemitic upbringing for a young white gentile in modern-day America; basically, I just considered them fellow whites with another religion than me and got along as well with them as I did with anyone of any other race and background. \n\nHowever, I feel a profound sense of betrayal when I see [the fellow white crowd](https://i.imgur.com/xsOUjpl.jpg) on Twitter, academics and Hollywood celebrities and the like who bash on *my* people all day and happen to be disproportionately. Not all Jewish people are like that and I know this for a fact; some of the most passionate advocates of the kind of views that I support have been *proud, Zionistic Jews themselves*. It's not like cooperation can't exist. However, when people tell me about how beneficial our alliance with Israel is, I wonder why Netanyahu or whatever influence networks he might have access to aren't doing more to tone down the parts of their diaspora doing and saying shit like this. It makes me feel like we're not getting enough out of our alliance in return for what we put in. I don't understand why essentially being compelled to support a foreign country or else be called a \"Nazi anti-Semite\" is evidence that we actually have a mutually beneficial relationship, rather than an abusive or a parasitic one. Look at the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's [\"working definition\"](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/working-definition-antisemitism) of anti-Semitism, which has been signed into [US law](https://www.breakingisraelnews.com/110752/s-carolina-sign-anti-semitism-proviso/) in some states (such as under Nikki Haley or her Republican successor) and which Corbyn was famously [pressured](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/05/jeremy-corbyn-labour-and-the-ihra-definition-of-antisemitism) to adopt *unconditionally, without qualifications* as Labour Party policy over this summer (Theresa May had already done so of her own initiative).\n\nCan you imagine if the Russians acted like that? Imagine if businesses which receive government contracts and universities weren't allowed support sanctions on Russia or platform anyone who did. Imagine if Russia tried to make it *literally illegal to criticize them* under European hate speech laws, which (obviously) isn't even a standard that the countries of Europe even hold *themselves* to. Allies who try to enforce loyalty at gunpoint don't sound like very good allies to me, that sounds more like conquerors.\n\n", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Conservative", "date_year_month": "2018-11", "created_utc_converted": "2018-11-24 19:50:54", "score_overall": 10, "words": "jewish jew jewish jewish jewish jewish conspiracy jewish jewish holocaust", "shared_words": "jewish jew conspiracy holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}

{"archived": false, "author": "GhostofCircleKnight", "body": "A lot can be garnered from sources on Wikipedia in the references section. Essentially, in the mid 19th century, Armenians and other minorities sought to reform the Ottoman legal system since they were second class citizens who did not possess the same legal rights, security protections, economic privileges, and also obligations of Muslims. Some Ottoman officials agreed that adhering to the Islamic system of believers and 2nd class dhimmis was the reason for the Empire's decline in competitiveness when compared to Europe. Upon lobbying by said groups, efforts began to institute the Tanzimat reform of modernizing the Ottoman Empire and moving it away from its Islamic legal system, though it also shirked nationalism and sought to redefine Ottomanism, integrating minorities and being socially liberal (decriminalizing homosexuality, women's rights, etc). This was the golden age of freedom and liberty in the Ottoman empire and minorities were given a voice and a place in parliament. \n\nThe Ottoman authorities sought to redefine the policy called Ottomanism, now meant to unite all the different peoples living in Ottoman territories, \"Muslim and non-Muslim, Turkish and Greek, Armenian and Jewish, Kurd and Arab\". The policy officially began with the Edict of G\u00fclhane of 1839, declaring equality before the law for both Muslim and non-Muslim Ottomans.\n\nHowever, this policy was not beloved by most Ottoman Turks. Many still adhered to the Islamic system and didn't want the already economically successful minorities of the Empire to be given greater rights. One such person was Abdul Hamid 2nd who deposed his brother Murad and became a tyrant who absolved the Ottoman constitution and parliament. He was beloved by Islamic conservatives, yet his anti-democratic policies only led to rebellions in the Balkans once Tanzimat fell. After a loss of territory, he decided that massacres would be the best way to prevent future rebellions and to punish those he scapegoated as responsible for the the Tanzimat reforms in the first place, most especially the Armenians. \n\nThis led to him ordering the Hamidian massacres and adding greater fuel to the fire in the Eastern provinces where unpunished Kurdish raids of Armenian villages was already commonplace. The massacres of up to 200k Armenians led these Armenian villagers to lose faith in their government, and a small % (1 to 5) began to take up arms to defend their villages from further Kurdish or Ottoman military attacks. Hamid wasn't seeking to exterminate the Armenians, however, because he still saw a place for them in his system, albeit one of utmost servitude. \n\nThe problem with Turkish denial is also it is denial of the terrible state minorities faced within the empire. It's also one of pride and greed. \n\nWhen Abdul Hamid 2 redefined Ottomanism as Islamic Orthodoxy, this also provoked reactions from more 'moderate' figures, who seeking to regain power lost when parliament was absolved, eventually overthrew Hamid. This is the group, the Committee of Union and Progress, which was heralded by Armenians and others as the saviors who would bring about a new parliament and a potential new Tanzimat. But the reality is these guys were one (but not the only) group of Turkish nationalists who sought to modernize the country in such a way that Tanzimat is not reinstated and Ottoman from so forth becomes associated with Turkishness and solely Turkishness, not necessarily Islam (which they saw as a tool to control the masses. It is also why the head shiek of the OE opposed the genocide to little avail). \n\nArmenian political leaders (pre-April 24) tried to make deals with the new authorities to reinstitute the freedoms Tanzimat once gave them, but the CUP was unwilling to make those concessions, fearing giving power to minorities would lead to an eventual breakup of their empire (not realizing the loss of the Balkans was Abdul Hamid's fault, not Tanzimat's). However, the CUP didn't know how to deal with the Armenian question... and following losses in winter of 1914, early 1915 where Eastern Armenians recruited into Russia's army helped play a role in Russian victories, the CUP decided to scapegoat all Ottoman Armenians, alongside Ottoman Assyrians and Anatolian Greeks, and begin a system of massacre, property confiscation, and deportation. Once Talaat decided that a few Ottoman governors (Aleppo) had been too easy on the Armenian deportee/prisoners, a change in administrative leadership was authorized. It became okay to kill all the women and children in the concentration camps via death marches, and at that point it became a genocide because there was no hope for return of the survivors whereas before it was very slim.   \n\nFor the Holocaust, Germany adopted the deportation train, minorities in labor camp where they'd be shot upon completion, and concentration camp model, except making it more mechanical and efficient, harder to escape from. Though the end result was the same, with over half of Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians dying in one, and Jews and Romani in the other.\n\nPre-1915 is important, because the CUP were well aware of how to expand what was done during the Hamidian massacres. \n", "score": 8, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "armenia", "date_year_month": "2018-11", "created_utc_converted": "2018-11-28 06:06:39", "score_overall": 4, "words": "jewish greed scapegoat holocaust", "shared_words": "jewish greed scapegoat holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}

The problem with most modern Judaism is that most Jewish people just don't understand this. Goyim is a horrible concept that conflicts with biblical Judaism. \n\n", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "freeworldnews", "date_year_month": "2018-11", "created_utc_converted": "2018-11-30 01:21:10", "score_overall": 11, "words": "holocaust holocaust jewish jewish jewish jew jew jew goyim jewish goyim", "shared_words": "holocaust jewish jew goyim", "socre_distint": 4}

Yes to much of what you state but gee, the fantasy part is just crazy stuff.\n\n\ni dont see why you just said all that? what did i mix? i never made the claim that zionism predated the talmud. i said the jews today wont tell you about the talmud today because of zionism today. \n\n&gt;Pretty sure it is but you don't show any proof for what you say.\n\nthe reason why israel is a state is because of the following:\n\n1- where are the borders of israel? there are none. even israel cant tell you where they are. nobody can because it would destroy decades of bullshit zionist reasoning and undo all of their propaganda. the borders of israel are effectively wherever the idf murders palestinian children. idf goes into some area, kills everybody, says it was because thy got too close to the new border they just made up 10 minutes ago, and then they build a settlement there. this is the greatest cause of tension between the united states and israel for the past 40 years.\n\n2- what is israel? is it a democracy? then what about the arabs? if most of the arabs arent israeli, then where are the borders of palestine? why do jews who have never been there being given the right of return while refugees who were expelled by zionists cant return to the homes their families had for over a thousand years? is israel an ethnostate? if it is then was the forced expulsion of palestinians from their homes ethnic cleansing? is israel a theocracy? then why cant all jewish converts be counted as jews? \n\nisrael cannot be a state because israel is a shape-shifting propaganda operation that cant get its story straight. israel will be a state when ALL major world powers  and its neighbors recognize it. iran, syria, lebanon, iraq, turkey, and pakistan see israel as a terrorist piracy operation. man they really fucked up with turkey they had that one in the bag.\n\n&gt;It all depends on who you consider a Jewish person. Ethnic Jewish? Jewish convert? What is Judaism? I can ask ten different people about what is Judaism and get ten different answers. You're being very general here and not paying attention to detail. My opinion is that a person can be an ethnic Jew such as Soros and Karl Marx and not be a believer in biblical Judaism.What is Judaism? Does the Talmud represent biblical Judaism? It certainly represents modern Orthodox Judaism. Ultra Orthodox I guess so. Reformist Jew? Conservative Jew?\n\ni am being very consistent. here is what i believe about judaism and if you watch this and reread what i wrote youlll see i dont contradict myself unless im mixing in some zionist language for the sake of context or because i just made an error. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcjO2nNz09k\n\n\n\n&gt;And that's all I need to know.

The problem with most modern Judaism is that most Jewish people just don't understand this. Goyim is a horrible concept that conflicts with biblical Judaism.\n\nzionism and israel is anti semitic and anti-abrahamic and it needs to commit crimes against humanity in the name of jews and judaism so we attack the wrong people in retaliation, and the best way to do that is to convince jews that the talmud tells them to do blood rituals on goyim babies. that way jews play along.", "score": 0, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "freeworldnews", "date_year_month": "2018-11", "created_utc_converted": "2018-11-30 11:17:28", "score_overall": 11, "words": "holocaust jewish jewish jewish jewish jew jew jew jewish goyim goyim", "shared_words": "holocaust jewish jew goyim", "socre_distint": 4}
