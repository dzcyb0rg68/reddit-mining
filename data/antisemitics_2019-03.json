They even have a political party in Israel called Jewish Home (Bayit Hayehdui). In Religious Zionism, providence explains how Israel won against the Arab world in the 48, 67, and 73 wars, and surviving still while outnumbered 200:1.\n\nIsrael won because of tactical and military advantages. In particular stupid military decisions by the Arabs and incompetence in war. If their victories were divinely inspired, their military wouldn't have suffered such a humiliating defeat against Hezbollah, who don't have even 1/10th of the military power of Israel. And they're also consistently repelled by Hamas when fighting on the ground, Israel is effective at raining terrorism from the sky against a starved concentration camp. There is also the other thing of genocide, as I said. If it is the belief of Zionists or some Zionists that Israel can be divinely inspired in spite of their genocide and ethnic cleansing, I think that says more about their faith than the state of Israel and/or Zionism.\n&gt; Ultimately the secular Israeli state, blessed by G-d, will lead to a Messianic Age, the olam habaah where Israel becomes something like a superpower, and Jerusalem, the holiest city to Jews, the capital of the world. 10% is not a huge number, but not small either. \n\nDare I point out the elephant in the room, that kind of close minded apocalyptic mindset was the same thing that brought the downfall of the Crusaders and ISIS.

Also notable is that in many cases, Muslims have become the target of violence.\n\nFor example last year three men from Illinois who were charged for planning to bomb a mosque. One of the men drafted a border wall plan for Trump.[6] I'll include this small excerpt from an article by USA Today, I implore everyone to read how far right terrorism is rapidly accelerating in America.

First he tweeted it[8] followed by him saying this as a statement during a speech later in the day.[9] Moreover, former Trump Campaign Chairman Cory Lewandowski went on national television and dehumanized a child with Down Syndrome who had been separated from their family.[10] President Trump has peddled anti-semetic conspiracies including the conspiracy that a prominent Jew is behind the migrant caravans[11] that he claims are \"invading\" the country.[12] And Fox News has repeated extremely dangerous xenophobic rhetoric that these migrants are bringing diseases with them, they're not.[13] Holocaust experts have compared the President's statements to Nazi propaganda.[14]\n\nThese xenophobic conspiracy theories are incredibly dangerous.

{"author": "Jijcf", "body": "\nWe reject the existence of normalized relations with the Zionist entity by any nation of this earth and call for Zionist organizations to be annihilated in total and collectively because of their status as one of the greatest dangers facing the planet and an international conspiracy that can only be fully beaten through a global struggle: armed struggle in some places, and boycott activity in others.\n\n \n\nWhile Modern Zionism is a \"secular\" concept, it cannot be seen as such in the conventional sense, because it espouses an exclusive state for the Jews.  This can no more be seen as secular than one could see the Vatican, ruled by the leader of the Catholic Church, as a secular state, even if it performs secular functions that a state must perform.  Secularism, in practice, has come to mean something far more enlightened than this.\n\n \n\nEven those who call for Arab-Jewish co-existence are simply using such sophistry as a Jewish colonialist bargaining chip.  After all, if these Jews like assimilating with their neighbors so much, why didn't they do that in Russia, Canada, Argentina, or whatever nations to which they each individually belong?  This is neither genuinely secular nor progressive.  The only thing genuinely progressive in the Zionist entity, involving Jews, is a bus bombing in Tel Aviv, with the number dead Jews reflecting the degree of progressiveness of that action.\n\n \n\nWe militantly reject the Eurocentric racism and opportunism of those who are totally aware of the Jewish threat and the social role that Jews play against all nations to which they belong, and yet who choose the path of dumping the Jews off in the land of Palestine, as if this were some sort of \"solution\".  The arrogance of this thought and behavior is boundless!  Purely one's own racism is at work, if rather than having to deal with their weak stomach for the Jewish question, one instead decides to cooperate with Jews and Zionists and move them out of the country, and which then accurses and punishes the Arab people who have done more than any other people in modern times to fight Jewish Supremacy and Zionism.\n\n \n\nAs consistent nationalists, must we not insist that the problems of Moscow, Berlin, or anywhere be solved by the national unit alone without making its problems an international drama?  Besides, as a matter of fact, the Jewish danger and Zionism must be fought even if with the firm recognition of the role of the national unit, ultimately on a global scale, in order to win a decisive political/military victory over the enemies of all humanity.\n\n \n\nWe stand with the Arabs and Muslims resisting the Zionist enemy, just as we stand with all people resisting imperialism and neo-colonialism, opposing all forms of scab behavior in this keynote struggle, and this regardless of how western leftists or international Jewry feel about the matter!\n\n \n\nOn the \"anti-Semitism\" misnomer and why our open disdain for Jews and Judaism is neither \"anti-Semitic\" nor chauvinistic.\n\n \n\nWhenever anyone attacks anything about Jews and Zionists, even if such attack clearly is objective and accurate, containing not a shred of racism whatsoever, it is almost always labeled \"anti-Semitism\ufffd and its author becomes a \"racist anti-Semite\".  The basis of this concept is that all Jews are Semites, and that they are being attacked because they are allegedly Semites.\n\n \n\nBy Semites, again we refer here to a macrocosm of nationalities encompassing one language group, one that makes this paradigm particularly comical as the Arabic language is Semitic, and therefore all Arabs are by definition Semites.  It is an attempt to give the impression that the Jews collectively constitute a nation, and that this nation is a legitimate state.  Well, not all Jews are \"Semitic\", as the Jew comes from a number of racial stocks and belongs to an even greater number of nationalities and speaks not a single common tongue\n\n \n\nThere exists a whole series of things which are unacceptable to the Jews and Zionists, and unfortunately today's Jewish-controlled western leftists, as well.  These range from the fact that Jews aren't a nationality and the bulk of them don't have even a shred of ancestral connection to the land of 1948 Palestine, to the Khazar origins of the Ashkenazi Jews, to the history of the Jews in the transatlantic slave trade which resulted in millions and millions of dead Africans, to the fact that revisionist historians have clearly shown that the three great tenets of the Jewish 'holocaust' myth are all lies, to approaching the parasitic social role of the Jew, or even the relationship they have been accused of having with Freemasonry.\n\n \n\nHow many Jews do you know who like to talk about the holohoax and its relevance to the Zionist entity?  Yet revisionist historians, many of them facing beatings, slayings, and long prison terms, have revealed that a number several hundred percent smaller than 5-6 million died during the Second World War, that no actual attempt to exterminate the Jews took place, and that the homicidal \"gas chambers\", whether diesel or dual use Zyklon B, never existed.\n\n \n\nWhen Arab resistance forces launch attacks against \"Israel's\" 1948 territories, how many \"anti-Zionist\" Jews actually support these actions?  Virtually none!\n\n \n\nWho gives a damn what the Jews like?!  The fact is that our struggle against Zionism and Jewish Supremacy does not require their approval or for us to \"prove\" anything to Jews.  In fact, within materialist parameters of struggle against Jewish behavior, ideology and social roles, which are not based on predetermined pseudo-racial characteristics of the Jew, but on individual and collective choices the Jew has made or at least chosen not to break with, it\ufffds actually anti-racist and progressive to be \"anti-Jewish\".  In essence, there are anti-Jewish positions which are idealistic and potentially, but not necessarily, chauvinistic, and then there are anti-Jewish positions which are based on materialism and grounded in reality.  Even \"anti-Semitism\", actually anti-Jewish racialism, is far less a problem today than is the very Jewish racialism which gives rise and form and content to its mirror image.  Before and behind the reflection of hating the Jew for racial sectarian reasons, there was the Jew and his racial sectarian behavior, which gives rise to malformed expressions of the goyim popular masses.\n\n \n\nHere again we argue that the world is exponentially a greater victim of the Jews than the Jews of the world!\n\n \n\nII. Beyond Judeophilia: A Vital Look at \"Karl Marx on the Jewish Question\"\n\n \n\nIn 1844, Karl Marx published an essay called \"On the Jewish Question.\"  This essay has often been suppressed or ignored by people calling themselves Marxists, because Judaeophilic tendencies have become dominant in such groups, and what Karl Marx had to say about Jews was certainly not flattering.  The essay is available online at:\n\n \n\nwww.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/jewish-question/index.htm\n\n \n\nIt is worth studying, because what was written about the Jews 162 years ago is true today as well.  Indeed, the Jews are, if anything, guilty of these vices on a far grander scale.  Let's be clear of whom Marx was speaking when he criticized Jews.  He wasn't speaking of bloodline.  Indeed, as many enemies of Marx often point out, that would have been quite a severe self-criticism. He wasn't speaking of religion, for he makes clear in his essay that he is not speaking of the \"Jew of the Sabbath.\"  He was clearly speaking of group identity, which would, of course, include secular people who call themselves Jews, even if they have never in their lives set foot in a synagogue.\n\n \n\nMarx starts off the essay by berating Jews for calling for their special emancipation.  He asks them why the German people should care about their emancipation, when they don't care about Germany.  Isn't it ironic that in certain respects Adolf Hitler came far closer to this position than Ernst Thaelman or Georgi Dimitroff?\n\n \n\n Marx also alluded to the Jewish dominance of finance capital, saying that the Jew in Vienna who is banned from German states still controls the fate of Europe.  He also clearly connected Jews with predatory capitalism.  Marx said, \"What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering.  What is his worldly god?  Money.\"\n\n \n\nMarx concludes by calling for the emancipation of the world from Jews, as the emancipation of the world from huckstering.  Marx was right in 1844, and his words are still true today.  We need to eliminate Jews from the world.\n\n \n\nJewish power over finance capital became power over the entire economy, as Lenin observed in \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism,\" without referring to Jews. Zionism also became a peculiarly Jewish form of colonialism, though Jewish finance capital backed other kinds of colonialism as well.\n\n \n\n", "score": 0, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "DebateCommunism", "date_year_month": "2019-03", "created_utc_converted": "2019-03-08 22:38:23", "score_overall": 34, "words": "conspiracy jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jew jewish jewish holocaust jew jewish jewish jew jew jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jew jew goyim jewish jewish jewish jew jewish jew jew jewish jewish jewish", "shared_words": "conspiracy jewish jew holocaust goyim", "socre_distint": 5}

I mean the fact that the \u201cAndrew Gillum dog whistled racists cause he said monkey\u201d crowd is denying a clear Jewish conspiracy dog whistle is absurd. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t talking about money in politics because she started with a low spending lobby. She wasn\u2019t \u201cjust criticizing Israel\u201d because she dog whistle the grand Jewish conspiracy. This isn\u2019t hard guys. I know cognitive dissonance is hitting you guys really hard, you don\u2019t want to believe that a Democrat could be a bad guy, but she doesn\u2019t like Jews. Get over it.\n\nI\u2019m just going to add that it\u2019s pretty funny to see the \u201cpunch a Nazi\u201d crowd becoming a bunch of socialists who defend anti semitism.

Israel will never stop being a convenient excuse for American and European governments to sell military equipment and services to Israeli-aligned forces in the region. Israel will never stop being a convenient distraction for religious extremists in America and Saudi Arabia, to gain power and support by arguing over who rightfully owns what in Israel.\n\nFrom a historical standpoint, Israel was minority Jew up until the 1920s and shifted only as a result of the Zionist movement, which itself only happened because of rising antisemitism against Ashkenazi Jews in the West - fueled predominantly by a populous that was terrified of a rapidly changing world and ended up blaming the Jews for the destabilization in the world, because in the 1880s, the complex shifting of monarchies to democracies, the chaos in France caused by the fall of Napoleon and the revolution of 1848, the rise of America, the creation of Germany, the decaying of Russia and the advent of Industrialization were extremely difficult to understand individually for the average person, let alone understanding all of this happening at once. The entire old world order was collapsing and people wanted something to blame for it all that was easy to understand: the unfortunately became the Jewish people, a relatively homogeneous culture that was a blend of Orthodox and mystic traditions that had been forced historically into non-desirable fields like money management.\n\nThe collapse of Mercantilism into Capitalism in the Industrial Age all of a sudden saw money managers become much more important and influential members of society. This was made especially true by the new economic systems emerging in America and the United Kingdom that were being copied and borrowed from in the emerging representative democracies across Europe. The Jews had effectively been lifted to prominence by a world that craved equal representation. This led to suspicion and conspiracy theories being thrown around, but were ultimately crystallized into their much more modern and recognizable form in Russia.\n\nAs Russia had faced one disastrous Czarist regime after another, they had seen the Russia that Catherine the Great built crumble into being the sick man of Europe. After attempts to cast the Ottoman Empire as being the source of Russia's failures fell flat, the Czarist regime's secret police under Nicholas II conspired with the Russian Orthodox Church to write *The Protocols of the Elders of Zion*. The Protocols centered around a narrative stolen from a relatively popular French fiction book by Maurice Joly called *Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu (1864)* about a secret society trying to take over the world. This same book inspired many of the Illuminati conspiracy theories that became popular after the original Illuminati group failed in a comically spectacular fashion (seriously, look up the history of the actual Illuminati sometime, its founder was one of the most what we would call today \"cringey\" characters in world history). The secret society of Joly's book was repurposed into a grand Jewish conspiracy that accused the Jewish people of every modern antisemitic prejudice and conspiracy we know today.\n\nThe Protocols would go on to become a bestseller in Europe and America, setting off a mad wave of antisemitism and would eventually find its way to young Bavarian ex-soldier named Adolf Hitler. The Protocols are directly referenced in Mein Kampf as one of the founding sources of Hitler's conspiracies about the Jews and would go on to inform much of the antisemitic propaganda crafted by Goebbels in the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda.\n\nTo this day American Evangelicals, Neo-Nazis, UKIPers, National Fronters, Islamic Extremists, Islamic governments and even Russia to this day still promote these outright lies, fabrications and plagiarized fever dreams as being part of the Jewish conspiracy. Israel provides fodder for them, their hatred and their recruitment of others to their causes.\n\nStopping violence against Jews by any group is impossible in the modern era. They are intricately tied into the false narratives of the establishment of modern society for *hundreds of millions* of people, their families, their churches, their mosques, their religions and their cultures.\n\nIf this problem was solvable, we would have solved it decades ago. The problem with the Israel problem, is that it's caused by a bad strand of RNA in the DNA that makes up the modern world order.", "score": 6, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "date_year_month": "2019-03", "created_utc_converted": "2019-03-10 23:20:16", "score_overall": 13, "words": "jew jewish conspiracy illuminati conspiracy illuminati illuminati jewish conspiracy jewish conspiracy jewish conspiracy", "shared_words": "jew jewish conspiracy illuminati", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "hannahstohelit", "body": "I researched this, because it seemed like a fascinating question and I had no idea of the answer, and I found an interesting book called German Rocketeers in the Heart of Dixie, by Monique Laney, which went into this question as it pertained to the NASA scientists working in Hunstville, Alabama (where Wernher von Braun led the team at Redstone Arsenal). It includes interviews with Jewish residents of Huntsville at the time that the German scientists moved in- not necessarily Jews who were working for NASA (as the book mentions, Jews had been subject to quotas in both college admissions and hiring in the interwar years, and so were underrepresented in engineering and science fields), but Jews who lived with the Germans who were working for NASA. \n\nSome Jews definitely seem to have been discomfited by having new neighbors who were German and/or Nazi-affiliated. One anecdote by a woman from a long-standing, mostly assimilated Jewish family in Huntsville describes how her father, who had been involved in the attempted rescue of Holocaust victims, forbade her from dating the sons of the German scientists who lived in the area. A man discussed how his grandfather, who had been a refugee from Russia in the 1910s and whose family were killed in the Holocaust, used to go to the back of his office when he heard someone in a German accent come in and would have his son deal with those customers- but also says that this was based on the grandfather's personal experience of antisemitism from German POWs who had been kept near Huntsville during the war and with whom he had worked. There was, however, no open hostility directed at the Germans by the Jews- they were very careful to keep up a veneer of politeness. \n\nIt should be noted- there was not necessarily a direct correlation between this veiled anger and any actual Nazi affiliations on the part of the Germans. To a great extent, it was just as much a part at a general feeling of anger at the German nation as a whole on the part of American Jewry, the sense of collective blame for the horrors of the Holocaust. One son of one of the German scientists, who later married a Jew, described his \"radar toward when a Jewish person\u2019s back gets up when they hear that I\u2019m German. . . . it\u2019s sort of a palpable kind of chemistry going on\" (123-124)- and this was in the 21st century! Imagine how much more intense those feelings of discomfort must have been among Jews only a decade removed from the Holocaust, but the anger was directed at Germans in general, not at the rocket scientists in particular. \n\nThis changed when a Huntsville scientist, Arthur Rudolph, was revealed in 1984 to have been in charge of a slave labor camp (most of the inmates of which were not Jewish) which produced V-2 rockets at Mittelbau-Dora. While Wernher von Braun had previously admitted that he'd known that slave labor was being used to produce rockets in Nazi Germany, he had claimed that the rocket scientists had no control over this and that it was entirely in the purview of the SS. It was then revealed that Rudolph had in fact directly chosen to utilize slave labor and supervised slaves in Dora, which led to Rudolph voluntarily giving up his US citizenship (as opposed to having it forcibly stripped from him) and leaving the country. This made it much clearer to the US public that von Braun had not been honest in his appraisal of the situation and that many of the German scientists brought to the US were almost certainly far more implicated in slave labor practices than had been previously assumed. \n\nWhile by and large the German scientist community in Huntsville certainly stood behind Rudolph, a large number of the rest of the (white non-Jewish) population did as well, as they attributed the growth of Huntsville and the US space program in general to these scientists and thought of them as their neighbors. They often felt that the treatment which Rudolph had received was a disgraceful reflection on the US, which had used him for his skills and then discarded him, and that people must be able to be forgiven for their past mistakes, especially in a war. The Jewish population of Huntsville, however, did not doubt that Rudolph was guilty. One woman (the same one mentioned above as being not allowed to date German boys) said that while she'd never really put two and two together about the rocket scientists and the Holocaust, she didn't doubt his guilt Another woman who had personally met Rudolph socially had a hard time reconciling the idea of a user of Holocaust slave labor with the nice man she'd met but also was confident that he was guilty of the crime. Her husband made a striking statement- while many non-Jewish Huntsville residents were saying that the US had used Rudolph and then tossed him out when they were done with him, he said that Rudolph's crime was using prisoners and when he was done with them tossing them in the crematorium. Laney uses this comparison to point out the vast perception gap between Jewish and non-Jewish residents of Huntsville. \n\nSome Jewish residents of Huntsville noted that while they had worked alongside the scientists and therefore pushed many of these thoughts (about potential Nazi collaboration on the part of their coworkers) away at the time (in the 50s and 60s), when the Rudolph story came out these thoughts resurfaced, and one described how since then she has never really stopped having negative thoughts about even the children of the scientists with whom she is now friends (including Rudolph's daughter). Jewish residents also were shocked and angered by antisemitism shown by many of their non-Jewish neighbors, as many of those defending Rudolph soon turned to conspiracy theories about \"the Jews\" being behind the whole setup and manufacturing a case. The case even brought outright Holocaust deniers like David Irving to town. They were also angered at the lack of any remorse expressed by their German neighbors for what had happened under their noses during WWII.

It's a great series and I shared it with a lot of friends. \n\nAnd then I found out this controversy, and I was extremely disappointed by Goose's views and fully support AGDQ's decision. But I don't hate him, and his views do not lessen his previous contribution to Goldeneye and Perfect Dark speedrunning or the speedrunning community as a whole. I sincerely hope his records are not wiped. But I will not share his videos anymore and I will not support any organization that wants to stay affiliated with him.\n\nI once held the views you have expressed throughout this thread, that silencing and ostracizing individuals with these views is counterproductive and only enforces those views. But I have learned through personal experience that is inaccurate. It doesn't matter what you do, because their views will not change from any outside evidence or argument. Debate is counterproductive, it only reinforces their racial views. They have lost the entire concept of objective truth. They can't be reasoned with, and any debate about their views will not be conducted in good faith. The platform granted to them by those that hold the views I once had and that are similar to yours is exploited as a recruiting tool. \n\nI said I learned that personally, and it's because over the past five years I initially took your stance in how to deal with the very concerning views that a few of my childhood friends have developed. It took me way too long to realize I lost them the moment they bought into white-nationalist bullshit.\n\nAny proof or documentation you could provide will be met with 'Jewish lies and propaganda' or equally ridiculous claims of Jewish conspiracy. I tried to understand how they have come to their views. I listened to podcasts, I listened to their unsubstantiated 'proof', and what was most disturbing is how they focus on 'optics' and why.\n\nTheir growth depends and is centered around their ability to phrase and parse their talking points as somehow having an equal footing to that of any opposing view. They actively try to twist objective reality to give merit to ideas such as holocaust denial. They try to frame it as if there is a real academic debate on whether or not events like the holocaust ever occurred. They want an equal footing. They want to weaponize the idea of free speech. It's not as self-aware and insidious of an action as it sounds either, they're aware of the lack of concrete evidence to backup their claims, they however are convinced that is just a consequence of a vast Jewish conspiracy. So instead of providing proof, which can't stand up to any academic scrutiny, they turn it into an argument about free speech and try to 'red pill' and 'wake up' as many people as they can in the process. \n\nMost people are able to see through it, but some don't. And those that fall for it, they don't come back easily. They've actively decided to ignore any and all evidence that doesn't fit into their racial views *because anything counter to their narrative is proof of Jewish 'trickery'*. It's a self reinforcing mindset. It is a societal virus.\n\nGoose's content didn't push an agenda, some of the phrases he used or comments he made made me raise my eyebrows a couple times, but I still shared his content.

{"author": "Red-Droid-Blue-Droid", "body": "I don't know what to tell you besides see a therapist if you can and that I understand you. I was the weird kid for being Jewish, got a lot of \"omg going to hell, why U kill Jesus, money Hollywood waaaa\" shit from Christian kids. Strangely or not, the Muslims and Sikh kids were fine with me. They surely know what it's all like better than some. Older Jews or ring one ones love to tell me how dangerous Muslims are, yet my worst experiences are with white Christians. Sometimes, it's like they lose their minds and go on endless bible spouting sprees. Right now it's them hounding me on Israeli politics and shit I don't know or can't care about. Or some of them act like anti-semitism isn't real, false flags and shit. Even better are the real conspiracy theorist who just amaze me with their bullshit. I'm sure the opposite is true somewhere, but that's just me. To this day, I still struggle with letting people know because I've gotten into the mindset of expecting the worst in every situation. I judge people fast and hard before deciding what they are, and I know it's a problem. My pessimism can be pretty bad. I'm currently seeing a therapist to work on anxiety, depression, and the strong pessimism that feeds the cycle. I may never be comfortable being open about it, it feels like taking off armor, but I'll try. \n\nWhat's sad is I've also experienced a lot of \"no real Jew\" stuff from my fellow Jews. You can never pray enough, never keep kosher or Shabbat to my heavenly standards, and many synagogs across all the major sects have been snobby rich it's like they want the money stereotype to be real. No self awareness, they shun and look down on Jews who aren't upper class. They set the bar so high with lavish Bar/Bat parties, super fancy gear, and like 2 sets rooms to be level 10000 kosher...and sometimes don't even try to hide that it's about money. And sometimes it felt real. Why did god favor them and not listen to me? Why did god make my dad sick? Why did my horrible family members live and \"only the good die young\"? Rabbis didn't help me with questions, they hand waved or shrugged or acted bored. The Chabad nearest me only talks to you for more than 5 min if you donate. Only Hillel people and maybe 1 reform rabbi helped me understand how real life and Judaism work, balance, and so on. I'm still not 100%, but at least I'm not an edgy angry atheist who does what was done to me. \n\nThese \"real Jews\" and anti-Semitic people drove me from Judaism so hard, I become an angry atheist from middle school through high school. I hated god, was suicidal, and more. I wrote off large parts of my own because of years of pain. I used to have ptsd like reactions to the though of going to or near synagogue, the real or imagined or expected judgment and hounding and interrogation was too much. What if a classmate saw me and blew my cover? So many what if's, it should be no shock I'm so anxious. I may never be very observant, I may stay reform or conservative, sometimes religion and I need to ignore each other or keep some space so extreme reactions don't happen. At best I really like Judaism, at worst I can't deal with it. I've got better friends, Jewish and non Jewish, who defy those old experiences. I've realized it's people and their choices, and I need to separate it all. I need to work on my reactions to people and such, try not to generalize. \n\nAnyways, done with my rant.

{"author": "Rough_Ad", "body": "On a Sunday morning at Beth Israel Worship Center in Wayne, N.J., a bearded pastor named Jonathan Cahn stood on an elevated platform, gazing over a full house. Stage lights shifted from blue to white as the backing band played a drifting melody. Two men hoisted curled rams\u2019 horns and let out long blasts.\n\n\u201cSome of you have been saying you want to live in biblical times,\u201d Mr. Cahn said, pacing behind a lectern. Then he spread his hands wide. \u201cWell, you are.\u201d\n\nSitting at the end of a sleepy drive an hour from Manhattan, Beth Israel may look like any common suburban church. But the center has a highly unusual draw. Every weekend, some 1,000 congregants gather for the idiosyncratic teachings of the church\u2019s celebrity pastor, an entrepreneurial doomsday prophet who claims that President Trump\u2019s rise to power was foretold in the Bible.\n\nMr. Cahn is tapping into a belief more popular than may appear.\n\nA recent Fox News poll found one in four Americans believe \u201cGod wanted Donald Trump to become president.\u201d Celebrities like the televangelist Paula White and Franklin Graham have boosted the idea. The president\u2019s own press secretary suggested as much in a January interview. And on the opening day of the Conservative Political Action Conference this month, the millionaire businessman Michael Lindell took to the stage and declared President Trump \u201cchosen by God.\u201d\n\nMr. Cahn was ahead of the curve.\n\nHe has dedicated an entire book to this very thesis, an insight he claims to have received from God. \u201cThe Paradigm: The Ancient Blueprint That Holds the Mystery of Our Times,\u201d in fact, is only the most recent installment of a best-selling series dealing with the supposed mystical meaning behind all manner of current events. In it, Mr. Cahn likens Mr. Trump to the biblical king Jehu, who led the ancient nation of Israel away from idolatry.\n\nWith his growing stature, Mr. Cahn is also a rising figure in some quarters of conservative politics. In an email to congregants, Mr. Cahn shared his latest good news: This weekend he is making his first trip to the president\u2019s vacation retreat, Mar-a-Lago. He is set to address a small gathering of activists and advisers.\n\nAfter worship on a recent Sunday, in a roped-off section flanked by security guards, Mr. Cahn signed piles of his books before a small crowd. At 59, Mr. Cahn cultivates a refined demeanor, rarely appearing without a signature all-black suit and tie. He laid his hands gently on one man\u2019s shoulders and offered quiet counsel. \u201cBe patient,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep praying for breakthrough.\u201d\n\nGail Greenholtz, an elder member, stood near the end of the line. \u201cMany of us consider him a prophet of our time,\u201d she said. \u201cA visionary.\u201d\n\nMichael Cooney, 58, had driven an hour to hear the pastor teach on politics and prophecy. \u201cIt\u2019s all relevant for this moment,\u201d he said. \u201cHe shows us that Trump was actually in the Bible.\u201d\n\nImage\nImage\nCentral to Beth Israel\u2019s story is the unlikely rise of its pastor, a liberal Jew transformed into an end-times evangelist. The tale is also a step into a controversial and burgeoning layer of American religion, where commerce, supernatural belief and patriotism blend freely. Daniel Silliman, a Valparaiso University professor of religion, called Beth Israel and its pastor part of a long tradition of Americans \u201clooking to prophecy as a way to absorb the chaos\u201d of current events. \u201cIt can make someone feel that God is working through human history,\u201d he said, \u201ctransforming anxiety into a sense of fullness.\u201d\n\nThe son of a Holocaust refugee, Mr. Cahn was raised in a nominally Jewish family in the New York suburbs. But from an early age, he was drawn to the more esoteric corners of belief.\n\nHe devoured the writings of Nostradamus, the Virginia psychic Edgar Cayce and far-out conspiracy theories about ancient astronauts. Mr. Cahn soon stumbled on \u201cThe Late Great Planet Earth,\u201d the 1970s best-seller that argued doomsday prophecies of the Bible were playing out with events like the Cold War and Israel\u2019s Six-Day War. Mr. Cahn bought the book thinking it was about UFOs; instead he was given a crash-course in Christian eschatology.\n\n\u201cI was just floored,\u201d Mr. Cahn said. On his 20th birthday, after a near-death experience \u2014 and to the dismay of his Jewish father \u2014 he became a Christian.\n\nBy the 1980s, Mr. Cahn was leading outreach for a hippy-style church in New Jersey. His hair and beard grown shaggy, he led services with a guitar slung around his neck. Mr. Cahn later broke off to lead an independent congregation, Beth Israel, and built his following through a slot on Christian radio, where his messages took on an end-times flavor.\n\nAfter the 2001 terrorist attacks struck Manhattan, Mr. Cahn adopted a sharp, even more apocalyptic focus.\n\nIn sermons, he began comparing the attacks to the ancient warnings of the Bible, drawing largely from the book of Isaiah, where God vows to punish the disobedient nation of Israel.\n\nMr. Cahn said abortion, gay rights and the perceived retreat of religion in the public square were all troubling signs that America, like ancient Israel, had lost its way.\n\nOnce rolling with this comparison, Mr. Cahn began seeing patterns everywhere. As the Israelites turned away from their God, they were attacked by Assyrians; America, in modern times, was also attacked by a foreign army from the East, Al Qaeda terrorists. After the ancient siege, the Israelites vowed to replant a destroyed sycamore grove with new trees; near ground zero, a huge sycamore tree was also destroyed, as the towers fell.\n\nThe supposed connections go on. Tenuous as they may seem, Mr. Cahn saw the links as compelling.

The book climbed up best-seller lists and hovered there for months, alongside blockbusters like \u201cFifty Shades of Grey.\u201d He followed his debut with a companion edition and three other titles, all embellishing on the same theme of  prophecies replaying today.\n\n\u201cNone of us knew it would be so successful,\u201d Mr. Cahn said. \u201cIt was the Lord\u2019s hand, I believe that.\u201d\n\nA charismatic preacher inveighing against imminent devastation is nothing new. America has long been fertile ground for would-be doomsday prophets, stretching back centuries.\n\nMatthew Sutton, a professor of history at Washington State University and the author of \u201cAmerican Apocalypse,\u201d said Mr. Cahn fits a unique American mold. \u201cIn key historical moments, religious figures like this find a way to step in,\u201d Mr. Sutton said. \u201cThey draw from apocalyptic theology and say, \u2018We have this secret knowledge and can explain what\u2019s going on.\u2019 It fosters this sense that God\u2019s judgment is hanging over your head.\u201d\n\nAmong several of Mr. Cahn\u2019s recent predecessors of this ilk would be televangelists like the Christians United for Israel founder John Hagee, whose books include \u201cCan America Survive?\u201d and Jim Bakker, the controversy-prone preacher who now hosts an end-times TV program and sells disaster survival products.\n\nMr. Cahn brings the tradition fully into the social-media age: many of his fans first saw him on Facebook; hundreds of posts and reposts of his sermons are uploaded on YouTube, slipped into the corners of the web where esoteric religion and conspiracy theories overlap.\n\nInto this mix came Mr. Cahn\u2019s latest book, \u201cThe Paradigm,\u201d which could be his most polarizing, tying his prophetic work to the election of Donald Trump.\n\nThe book, published in the months after Trump\u2019s win, again likens America to the ancient nation of Israel \u2014 two peoples, Mr. Cahn says, who have a unique relationship with God. He then argues that all sorts of figures in contemporary politics have biblical counterparts. Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, for example, are the modern-day analogues to wicked Ahab and Jezebel. Trump is the  warrior-king Jehu, who took control of the nation and cast idols out of the capital. \u201cJehu also sought to drain the swamp,\u201d Mr. Cahn said.\n\nTrump, \u201clike his ancient predecessor,\u201d Mr. Cahn writes in his book, was a \u201cflawed vessel\u201d being used by God. \u201cThe unlikely and controversial warrior was destined to become the new ruler of the land,\u201d Mr. Cahn goes on. \u201cThe template would ordain that Donald Trump would become the next president.\u201d\n\nPointing to Trump\u2019s possible rollback of abortion rights, appointment of conservative Supreme Court judges and the move of the American Embassy to Jerusalem, Mr. Cahn casts Trump as a heroic figure. \u201cTrump is offering us a window for revival, a window to return to God,\u201d Mr. Cahn said. \u201cWhat happened in the election was not about Trump but about something much higher, the purposes of God.\u201d\n\n\n", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "politics", "date_year_month": "2019-03", "created_utc_converted": "2019-03-17 20:17:16", "score_overall": 6, "words": "jew holocaust jewish conspiracy jewish conspiracy", "shared_words": "jew holocaust jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "Alexinova", "body": "Islamophobia is oft criticized as a term for it implies that any and all negative perception of Islam is hateful. Opponents of Islamophobia being a legitimized and systematized term say it is a form of censorship and a method of silencing critics. Proponents of it tend to have a better grasp of history and the systematization of anti-Jewish rhetoric turning into racial discrimination which lead into the holocaust. The conundrum with Sam Harris and other critics of Islam are that they do not wish to acknowledge the racial implications their words have, approaching each discussion with such a strict sense of ethnocentrism that they nigh dehumanize the 'other'. Their arguments exist purely in vacuums where religion is but a scapegoat for every suffering, excluding sociopolitical and economical prospects which reduced the Islamic world to ashes. This terribly simplistic argument 'otherizes' the other group quite successfully for it was not invasions or corruptions which created Daesh and Al-Qaeda, it was some vague monster named 'Islam', ergo Islam is intrinsically dangerous  and its followers are enablers which translates into the mind of a nationalist as 'expelling the germ to continue Western progression'.\n\n&gt;There is no stopping them (Jews) .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. German culture has proved itself ineffective and powerless against  this foreign power. This is a fact; a brutal \\[inescapable\\] fact. State,  Church, Catholicism, Protestantism, Creed and Dogma, all are brought low  before the Jewish tribunal, that is, the irreverent daily press \\[which  the Jews control\\]. The Jews were late in their assault on Germany, but once they started there was no stopping them. Gambetta, Simon, and Cr\u00e9mieux were the dictators of France in 1870\u20131871.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Poor, Judaized France! In England, the Semite Disraeli \\[Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli\\], a  German hater\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0, holds in his vest pocket the key to war and peace  in the Orient \\[the East\\].\n\nThe Victory of Judaism over Germandom by Wilhelm Marr. Sounds awfully similar to the rhetoric these critics oft give, does it not? \"The Great Replacement\". The line between religious critique and racism is of the thinnest strand. There is no doubt that Islam is primarily associated with dark skinned individuals due to the perception constructed by prominent figures and it is quite known that Sikhs fall victim to targeted violence for they are thought of as being Muslim. \n\n&gt;After the multiple jihadist terror attacks Western cities have faced to  date, it has been these same far-left and Islamist voices resisting the  call to name the ideology behind these attacks as \u201cIslamism\u201d, and to  distinguish it from the religion of Islam. They have taken the view that  talking about the Islamist ideology unfairly stigmatises all Muslims.  They have preferred to beseech us all to understand the grievances that  fuel the anger of jihadists, and have encouraged instead \u2018hug a Muslim\u2019  campaigns. Yet, after New Zealand, these same voices paradoxically  insist on directly addressing white nationalist ideology; they hounded a  pregnant Chelsea Clinton; they have taken to compiling blacklists of  individuals they do not like; and they are calling for the deplatforming  of \u201cright-wing\u201d pundits and protests against \u201cright-wing\u201d media.  Consistency has been sorely missing. This is dangerous, despicable and  disingenuous. Only the extremist seeks to erase all opposition. \n\nMaajid Nawaaz's understanding of religious discrimination and ideologies is quite simplistic. White nationalism differentiates from Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Christianity in two ways: The foundational principle and the two commandments. The foundational principles of Islam are: There is One God who is merciful and forgiving and His final messenger is Muhammad. The two commandments of every religion are: follow the path to salvation/enlightenment and love thy neighbour, do unto them what you wish is done to you. White nationalism and far-right ideology is found strictly upon the principle of expelling the foreign agent which is interrupting the pure Aryan/Caucasian/Arab/Jewish/Hindu/Muslim's (etc.) progression. Nationalism is divisive and isolationist due to its essence. \n\n&gt;With a fervor for accepting a grotesque self-image of supremacy and for finding scapegoats to be blamed for subverting this greatness, Germany  turned to National Socialism in 1933. By 1936, Germany had become the  \"anti-Semitic country *par excellence*\" (Valentin 1936, 5).  Traditional Christian-based anti-Semitism combined with scientific  racism, economic woes, and political instability to set the stage for  what would eventually culminate in the Holocaust.  \n\n\"Islam is holding back the Middle East therefore it will hold back the West ergo we must expel these Muslims to progress socially and morally.\" It is quite naive to think that any and all critique of Islam, be it strictly alone of the ideology, does not have racial implications, especially when there are imperialistic and ethnocentric undertones within each criticism. Furthermore, it removes the idea of a 'liberal Muslim', creating a perceived 'inherent moral conflict' between every Muslim and the West. The far-right, due to their nationalistic foundational principle, are intrinsically discriminatory. While I do not agree with deplatforming them (there must be a form of equilibrium but it has been disturbed with nationalism on the rise), they must be argued and held accountable for inciting nationalism. The worst flaw in their arguments is that everything in relation to Islam must be absolute. 'Islam calls for this, Islam calls for that'. Islam is inherently terror in their arguments. Reformation will never come with such rhetoric, all it will do is make Muslim children feel they have no place and join Daesh and white children feel as if they are under invasion and join Neo-Nazis.

{"author": "xepa105", "body": "&gt; why do so many people think Jews are behind every bad thing that happens?\n\nIt comes from a very old \"tradition\" that can be traced all the way back to the Early Middle Ages. Basically, Jews were very spread out throughout Europe and the Middle East from Late Antiquity. And especially after the rise of Islam effectively separated the Christian and Muslim worlds, this gave Jews a certain kind of ease of movement between the two, since they had a presence on both sides and were seen as somewhat non-aligned with either side.\n\nThis flexibility was also what fostered anger since the Jew was seen as an 'other' everywhere he went, he had no place to call home, no cities or villages where they were the majority; they were always the minority. As you can guess, whenever shit went bad anywhere - be it floods, or droughts, or pestilence, or any other form of so-thought Divine retribution - the Jews were often used as a scapegoat. You know how immigrants are the go-to bad guys for populists nowadays? That was the Jew back in the past. It didn't help that the 'The Jews killed Jesus' myth was very popular back then.\n\nOftentimes this hatred would spark massive uprisings against the Jews, which led to indiscriminate violence and killings. When the Crusades were called, a lot of cities in France and Germany went crazy against their Jewish population for no other reason than being caught up in the religious fervour of the time. When the Black Death hit, and Jews were seen to be less affected by it (which might actually have been true, but only because Jews lived in isolated Ghettos, and as such could be better protected against disease) they were the ones who were targeted.\n\nThe stereotype of the money-controlling Jew - which is the most common version of the Evil Jew stereotype now - also has its roots in the Middle Ages. Slowly throughout the decades and centuries, Jews were increasingly restricted on what kind of jobs they could do, to the point where the only real profitable job was to be a merchant (dealing with money was seen in the medieval times as unclean and sinful, which meant that it was looked down upon, and therefore allowed for Jews to partake in). And remember how I mentioned there were Jews everywhere in Europe and the Middle East? Well, because of that, it was a lot easier for a Jew to go into Muslim territory, buy products there, and then resell in a Christian territory, and vice versa. This meant that, although Jews were completely disenfranchised in Christian Europe (and largely so in Muslim lands), they had access to wealth. Now imagine you're a church-going, God-fearing, tithe-paying Christian and yet the Jesus-killer Jew has more money than you? That caused a lot of tension and anger back then.\n\nThen there were the loans. Back then, the Catholic Church listed Usury as a very serious sin, meaning that good Christians should not lend money and charge interest, which was all well and good, except they did - most of the most important bankers of all time were and are Christian (the Medici, Fugger, Pazzi, etc.). There were also Jews who went into banking for the same reason, and because they could - again, dealing with money was seen as icky and beneath 'people of means'. The difference, and the reason why Jews became so strong in that sector, was that Christian bankers could - and would - often screw you over on your interest rates and repayment methods, etc. Whereas Jew could not do so, because if they tried, they would have an entire city come down and burn down their operation. So it became a well-know fact after a while that if you wanted a loan where the bank wasn't going to screw you, you went to the Jewish bank. The only drawback was the stigma of doing business with Jewish people. But as that stigma began to become less important in society, and as society became more and more reliant on loans and debt, Jewish families grew their businesses in size and importance to the point where some were some of the richest people in the world.\n\nAnd as the dominant parts of society became more and more bourgeois, bank-dependent, and as Jewish families used this and their money to establish themselves worldwide, the old prejudices and hatred evolved from Jews being the killers of Christ, the eater of babies, and the propagators of pestilence, to the Jews being the controllers of money, the puppet-masters of the world, and the propagators of war and death.\n\nThe modern conspiracies about the Jews are nothing more or less than the Anti-Semitism of the Middle Ages with a modern veneer.", "score": 17, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "worldnews", "date_year_month": "2019-03", "created_utc_converted": "2019-03-22 20:54:28", "score_overall": 14, "words": "jew scapegoat jew jewish jew jew merchant jew jew jew jewish jewish jewish jewish", "shared_words": "jew scapegoat jewish merchant", "socre_distint": 4}
{"author": "louatsi1", "body": "What benefits do you get from being racist? I only see negatives in hating a group of people, like it takes effort and you gotta invest resources into it. I think people dont become racist because its easy and gives them stuff. At least where Im at racists are looked down upon, often face scorn by the society and are outcasts. I mean even in this thread you can tell the general sentiment towards people who express something other than \"because they are scapegoats\"/\"because people are evil they always wanna bully someone\". I am not saying that those people are racist, but the moment you spew something that could me misinterpreted as anti semitic you will get downvoted to hell online and are met with scorn in the real world. You have to go well outta your way to hate someone and stand nothing to gain from it which leads me to believe that there is something else going on with the jew haters.  \n\n\nPerhaps this is the reason why some people are hating jews right now, because they feel that they are a protected class by society, with more privileges than others. Many antisemites view the Jewish people as professional victims, and I've heard people use the following examples to illustrate this:  \n\\-One can bicker and argue about all sorts of horrific historical events and debate the number of victims, yet as we all know this is really not accepted when done about the holocaust for example. In fact it is illegal to express anything else than the 6 million jew figure in relation to the holocaust in many countries, it can get you into serious trouble in German speaking countries. The bigoted type will view this as preferential treatment toward jews and it provides a fertile ground for conspiracy theories.   \n\\-Some of the ultra conservative types I had conversations with will argue that positions of power held by jews are passed on to other jews. They are a tight nit community that will look out for one another and show other jews preferential treatments, this leads to what they call jewish nepotism. Once they have accumulated a few positions of power in a company, organization or industry their successors will usually also be jewish, leaving others feeling disenfranchised and hateful. (The people in question have shown me some evidence to back that claim, but it was too long ago and I dont care enough to do a deep dive to find this, what matters is that to the people holding these hateful views its a reality, substantiated or not)  \n\\-They heavily invest in education. Historically the jewish people have amassed a lot of books and knowledge, these were some of their most prized possessions. Since jewish families and communities place so much emphasis on constant education and intellectual advancement they tend to end up in better paying jobs with better options. This breeds resentment from others. You can take a look at the Nobel Prize laureate list and will find out that jewish people are WAY disproportionately represented here. Envy in this case leads to hate.   \n\n\nThe above points were ones that i havent seen mentioned in here yet, of course theres the whole money lending and not being allowed land dynamic which others mentioned and that historically shaped the hatred of jews. Its not surprising that people dislike paying back their creditors. Additionally, its the same as the bad rap bankers and finance people are getting nowadays people view these professions as predatory and not creating value, the inner eye sees a greedy vulture sapping every penny out of hard working laborers when one thinks of financial institutions. Financial institutions are associated with jewish influence, for historic reasons as well as the disproportionate number of jews in these professions still nowadays.   \n\n\nDont really thinks it matters, but for those of you who want to know what sorta background I come from so you understand my spin on things: German, 25-30, lived, studied and worked in many european countries &amp; upper-middle class background (lawyers, doctors and that sorta crowd of middle class).  \n", "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "date_year_month": "2019-03", "created_utc_converted": "2019-03-22 21:46:46", "score_overall": 12, "words": "jew jewish holocaust jew holocaust conspiracy jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish", "shared_words": "jew jewish holocaust conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

Quite a lot of these involve claims that *teh j00s* are taking over the world via the banking industry for some unspecified revenge against Good Christian Folk, and [quite a lot of these have historically tied in to the original \"baby-eating\" conspiracy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel) in which it was claimed *teh j00s* were, uh, drinking blood and somehow grinding up Christian babies to bake into unleavened bread.  (Yes, pretty much this was the very first version of the \"adrenochrome is made from babies\" thing.  Yes, the Adrenochrome Thing IS pretty much a modern version of the \"blood libel\", and as much as the NAR in particular tends to have a creepy level of quasi-idolatry for practically everything that's culturally Jewish they seem to have missed that QAnonsense is basically pushing a renewed blood libel with a bit of sci-fi added on.)  \n\nIn fact, the \"j00ish banker Xanatos Gambit\" conspiracy theory has had such a long run that both the phrase \"international bankers\" and the very surnames of historically Jewish families that have been involved in banking (like, oh, the Bilderbergs, and, yes, especially the Rothschilds) have in and of *themselves* become dog-whistles for the International j00ish Illuminati Conspiracy (TINIJIC).  Racists, especially when not allowed to drop the K-word outright, would very euphemistically refer to \"international bankers\" or \"the Rothschild conspiracy\" or \"the Bilderberg plot\" whatnot--pretty much everyone knew damn well they were talking about *teh j00s.*  (Again, just like racist asshats on Twitter and elsewhere like to put multiple parentheses around the names of people who are descended from Jewish families.  Nobody said racists weren't entirely lacking in invention in finding new ways to slur folks.)\n\nAnd yes, probably one of the single nastiest knock-down drag-outs I ever had with my NAR-devotee maternal unit was when I explicitly pointed out the anti-Semitic dog whistles in a TV preacher (on community cable TV station) ranting about the Rothschilds and the Bildebergs and the International Bankers...", "score": 5, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "Qult_Headquarters", "date_year_month": "2019-03", "created_utc_converted": "2019-03-23 15:14:31", "score_overall": 13, "words": "conspiracy jewish jewish conspiracy libel jewish libel conspiracy jewish illuminati conspiracy conspiracy jewish", "shared_words": "conspiracy jewish libel illuminati", "socre_distint": 4}
{"author": "The_Bill_Brasky_", "body": "If a Jew is born in America, are they Jewish, American, or Jewish-American?  He is a German Jew.  Neither are necessarily wrong, but it's worth noting that he was born in (then) Prussia to an ethnically Jewish family, rather than a German child to a family that practiced Judaism.\n\nIt's an important distinction because, as you've suggested in your previous replies, it's not something people on the internet would admit to or acknowledge.  This is, I believe, because of his political writings and his Jewish ethnicity's (wrongful) implication that the point of his writings might be contrasted with the principle known as Cultural Marxism: that age-old excuse that every group likes to lean on before murdering or hating Jews.  Cultural Marxism asserts that Jews, given their historically significant role in financial markets in Europe and America (as well as entertainment in more modern times) is actually an effort by the diaspora to pull the strings of world leaders and exact dominance over the globe.  It also partially lends itself to the stereotype that Jews are obsessed with money, get bullied, and seek revenge in cunning or duplicitous ways.\n\nEssentially, people might look at his heritage and assign false value to the Cultural Marxism conspiracy.  And as we all know, that leads to White Supremacy or Fascism taking root in European Country X or Modern American Candidate Y.\n\nDistancing Marx from the Jewish Diaspora religiously and culturally, as he was, paints a more realistic picture of both his political theories and how difficult it may be to scapegoat Marxist lenses altogether as \"Jewish conspiracies\".", "score": 0, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "2007scape", "date_year_month": "2019-03", "created_utc_converted": "2019-03-23 23:34:21", "score_overall": 10, "words": "jew jewish jewish jew jewish jewish conspiracy jewish scapegoat jewish", "shared_words": "jew jewish conspiracy scapegoat", "socre_distint": 4}
{"author": "foot_kisser", "body": "&gt; The problem with that logic is that the only people who are in on the 'joke' and want to do it are people who are actually white supremacists. This means if you see someone doing it, chances are that person is actually a white supremacist.\n\nThat's not true at all.  \n\n&gt; One\n\nThat's a question about IQ and race, not on the \"JQ\".  \n\nThe \"JQ\" is essentially \"Isn't there a sinister Jewish conspiracy?  And how should we solve this problem?\".  \n\nPeterson's answer pisses the white nationalists off.  He says there is no Jewish conspiracy, that instead a subset of Jews have a higher than average IQ, causing them to be disproportionally represented in positions of influence.  They want there to be an international globalist Jewish conspiracy.  He debunks them.  They don't like being debunked.  \n\n&gt; two\n\nThat's the one I remembered.  \n\n&gt; three\n\nHave you taken a look at this guy's youtube channel?  He's not a fan of Peterson.  He is a fan of Hitler and interested in UFOs, from the titles of his videos.  \n\nHe has 4 videos on Peterson, this one, part one and two of a longer version of this one, and one titled \"The Occidental Observer Challenges Jordan Peterson for Selling Out\".  The title of this one includes the word \"confronted\", and has an unflattering thumbnail.  \n\nIn contrast, he has 24 videos on Hitler, most with complimentary titles, the word Jew shows up 11 times, including another time he confronted a different professor with the \"Jewish question\", and the word UFO shows up 32 times.  \n\n&gt; four\n\nIt's interesting that you'd link this one instead of to the Q&amp;A video from his channel.  \n\nThis one has subtitles *mocking Peterson* for disagreeing with the white nationalist position.  \n\nI suspect the motive for asking the question was to make videos like this, so I'm not convinced the question was asked by a fan instead of an opponent, but since it was asked on his Patreon Q&amp;A, I'll go ahead and give you credit for this one too.  \n\nSo that brings up the total number of times he was asked this question by people who could arguably be called his fans to two.  You're ignoring the fact that his answer doesn't make them happy, BTW.  \n\n&gt; It is literally the first link on google when you google his name and the words jewish question.\n\nYou told me it was a section on his website.  There is no section, just one page, thoroughly debunking the JQ.  \n\n&gt; Yet you claim that white supremacists don't like him. So strange.\n\nI don't usually like to link to alt-right stuff, since I don't want to point people in the wrong direction, but since you're almost certainly going to be the only one to look at this, I'll make an exception.  \n\n[Here's one of (if not the) most popular alt-right youtube channels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc3o4YmHJbc) reacting to Peterson getting asked the \"JQ\".  \n\n&gt; the exact sort of thing you don't want to be on the same page as nazis.\n\nHe's not only not on the same page as nazis, he's in complete opposition to them.  He went out of his way to teach his students how to avoid exactly that.  \n\nThe closest thing you have to evidence is that he was asked a question where his answer debunks them totally, and they disliked him as a consequence.  \n\n&gt; You literally waved away a guy giving a nazi salute as 'just a white nationalist'\n\nYou're literally misrepresenting me here.  \n\n&gt; Actually he says plenty of racist stuff (Mostly debunked 'science' on race and IQ),\n\nReally?  You think talking about facts is somehow racist?  \n\nCome on.  \n\nAnd how would you answer the \"JQ\" then?  It's a fact that Jews are and have been overrepresented in various positions of power.  If you take away the IQ explanation, what's left?  Do you have an alternate explanation, one that could persuade people considering becoming white nationalists not to believe in the \"Jewish conspiracy\"?  \n\nIf you just stick your head in the sand and hide from the question, it makes the conspiracy theory look plausible.  \n\n&gt; You either don't know a fairly basic term in political discussions or you're playing dumb.\n\nNo, you weren't being clear.  \"Demographics\" doesn't tell me which demographic you're talking about.

She's Jewish herself and works with other Jewish activists.\n\nCriticising him for visiting Israel is perfectly legitimate. It's wrong to ignore the calls by Palestinians to boycott Apartheid Israel, just as it was wrong to ignore the calls by black South Africans to boycott Apartheid South Africa.\n\nI'm sure he's criticised some aspects of Israeli policy. Doesn't make him not pro-Israel though. His efforts to persuade the NEC to adopt the bullshit IHRA definition prove he is no supporter of a free Palestine.\n\n&gt;Her posts often imply he\u2019s pulling the strings behind Labour\u2019s disciplinary procedures, but he doesn\u2019t oversee them &amp; is one of 30+ members of the NEC. \u2018Labour friends of Lansman\u2019 refers to \u2018Labour friends of Israel\u2019. Doubt she would have said the same about a non-Jewish person\n\nHe doesn't oversee them, but pretending his control over Momentum doesn't give him an enormous amount of influence is dishonest. The right wingers of the NEC are always going to support expelling left wingers, if the head of Momentum supported those left wingers, the right could be outvoted.\n\n&gt;In another example of Walker dangerously conflating Jewish people and Zionism/Israel, she shares an article about \u201cpressure from Jews\u201d rather than pro-Israel activists.\n\nA completely dishonest account of what the attached picture shows.\n\n1) She isn't sharing an article, she's sharing somebody else's comment about that article.\n\n2) The comment explicity says the pressure came mainly from Christian Zionists not from Jews.\n\n3) The article is from Forward, an American mainstream Jewish publication founded in 1897. Implying that Forward is antisemitic is bizare.\n\n&gt;Walker also shared a bizarre post about the controversy over the appalling comments Jared O\u2019Mara made online when he was younger being a Zionist plot, even though Jared admitted these were disgraceful and sincerely apologised. This is a totally unfounded conspiracy theory.\n\nSaying that someone may have searched through O'Mara's old social media to find things to discredit him for political reasons doesn't mean the comments weren't disgraceful.\n\nAnd it has nothing to do with antisemitism. She didn't claim it had anything to do with Jews.\n\n&gt;And, of course, Walked defended Ken Livingstone\u2019s comments about Hitler and Nazis, which if you ask me is enough reason to get the boot \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22\n\nThe Zionist Organisation of Germany made a deal with Hitler.

{"author": "Us3rn4m34lr34dyT4k3n", "body": "First Part:\n\n&gt;Really. Can you just decide to hold a different opinion in the next minute and believe it? No. You can\u2019t force a new perspective on yourself. You must be convinced of it.\n\nYes and as I set the standard for what convinces me, I am the person to decide what opinions I hold, drop, keep or whatever...\n\n&gt;Accuse someone of holding a position they don\u2019t hold and refuse to substantiate the claim when called out. Such integrity and intellectual honesty.\n\nDude with all due respect that thread is getting really long and if you keep responding to the first comment instead of the one where I made a claim it becomes even more annoying to look it up. So if you don't care enough to provide the least bit of context I don't care enough to look it up. Deal with it or change your behavior...\n\n&gt;At this point I think it would be more useful to get you to be specific. Please give me specific examples of speech that you would deem a violation of a \u201cright not to be verbally abused\u201d which is not already illegal. There\u2019s a lot of vague talk about power dynamics, certain contexts in which expressing opinions is authoritarian, opinions you view as facts, etc and I\u2019d like to see specifics.\n\nThe most obvious would be slurs and insults and furthermore the stuff that falls under libel, slander and harassment. The latter should already be illegal and the former might be subsumed under the latter, I'm not a lawyer. But as far as I know the legal definitions for these terms are so strict that they barely apply to anything. Could you give an example that what we defined so far as harassment is actually covered under harassment? Also the vagueness is kind of deliberate, I do not intend to compile a blacklist of words and concepts that are taboo as I don't think that is a good approach. That being said the concept of power dynamics and \"expressions of opinions\" that are authoritarian or opinions being used as facts isn't vague and we've discussed plenty of examples for these so far, so I'm not really getting your point here.\n\nSecond Part:\n\n&gt;Remind me, which side is for small government and which side is for increasing government control?\n\nAnd have you ever asked yourself **why** they are for a \"small government\" and what that actually means? Because if you take a closer look this \"small government\" essentially means that wealthy business people are \"free\" to not give a fuck about the negative [externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality), because they are no longer obligated to get through the democratic process on topics that involve the general public. That's actually an authoritarian move because it shifts power over people from the deluded state of a democracy to the uncontrolled tyranny of a wealthy minority. I never understood why people cheer for giving up **their** control over politics. Seriously unless you get rid of the underlying power dynamic, getting rid of the government only means that a shadow government will emerge over which you have no control at all... Congratulation, you played yourself if you honestly believe in that fairy tale...\n\n&gt;Is this you suggesting that Soviet Russia, Maoist China, and the Khmer Rouge weren\u2019t left wing?\n\nFirst of all, in order to make things clear: Those are just definitions and they aren't my definition, that is apparently how social science and politics, group the left-right spectrum. \nSo the aforementioned dictatorships were at least in rhetoric and projected goals \"left wing\" as their preferred system was one of no social hierarchies (neither politically nor economically) however it should be controversial to see that the actual system they brought about was really nothing like that. The party hierarchy is rather a caste system and so it's rather a right wing government. Whereas some of the stuff that you probably think of as \"right wing\" might actually be left wing in that framework. What makes the conservative worldview right wing is rather it's defense and support for social stratification, leading in it's extremes to social darwinism. Again at the end of the day those are only names the question is not whether you group yourself in the loaded terms of left and right but whether or not you are in support of social hierarchies or not. \n\n&gt;Then check it.\n\nAre you referring to this:\n&gt;And here's a ton of lawyers on this point: https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/is-accusing-someone-of-being-a-racist-defamation-p-1055687.html\n\nThose are 6 answers but you're talking about 55 lawyers, so I'm a little confused...\n\n&gt;How does this rebuff my point at all?\n\nThe fact that there is a difference in being able to broadcast your opinion is relevant to the point that \"nobody can be silenced\". Because you can practically silence people without actually banning their speech. I mean that McDonald's hot coffee incident is a good example where that woman suffered 3rd degree burns and it apparently was legit McD's fault, but where the media representation was that the woman was too stupid to drink her coffee or to realize that coffee is served hot. So effectively her opinion was silenced due to the fact that it didn't got the attention that the opposing opinion got. And while that is not the definition of silencing it has effectively the same effect. And no I'm not proposing legal ways to change that I'm just making sure that you are aware of those shortcomings.\n\n&gt;See first section.\n\nFirst section of what?\n\n&gt;Not only see first section, but really? So that happening in San Francisco is totally cool, but if it happens somewhere in Alabama then it\u2019s a problem?\n\nDon't get me wrong, you're a piece of shit regardless where you say that, but it makes a difference to know that a random stranger is an asshole and that when push comes to shove the people around you will side with the person being harassed over the harasser or whether it's literally the other way around and people will protect the bully over a person offending him by just being themselves not even engaging with him in any way...\n\n&gt;At no point do I argue this.\n\nThen what point did you try to make arguing about \"underlying statistics\"? \n\n&gt;Most people for most of history were dirt poor subsistence farmers.. \n\nAs far as I remember you're claim was that of below average immigration due to lax or missing restricting factors and now you argue that they were mostly average?\n\n&gt;What is?\n\nThe idea that before 1924 immigrants would fall into that category:\n\"any convict, lunatic, idiot, or person unable to take care of him or herself\" \njust because they technically could. \n\n&gt;Jews.. they were prohibited from voting, prejudice in the form of stereotyping Jews as swindlers, blood libelers, part of an international Jewish conspiracy, targeted by the KKK, smeared with responsibility for the emergence of communism during red scares, etc etc.\n\n&gt;Asians.. died working on railroads in dangerous conditions and poor pay, while other workers rioted against them and drove them out of towns, confined to Chinatowns which didn\u2019t get police protection, not granted voting rights, not granted the right to purchase property, forced deportations, internment, etc etc.\n\n&gt;Irish.. religious persecution, died working railroads in brutal conditions, assumed to be violent drunks, forbade from entering establishments \u201cno Irish, no blacks, no dogs\u201d, forbade from being employed \u201cno Irish need apply\u201d, claims of being an inferior race, etc etc.\n\n&gt;Blacks obviously. The list goes on. History is a nasty place.\n\nYes, history is a nasty place but that didn't really answer my questions you made claims about success being connected to culture, which kinda perpetuates inferiority claims. So the question how long that bullshit persistent how rigorous it was applied and when it was finally dropped is kind of important. Also my intent is not to rank oppression in any way shape or form, my point is just that you're making a claim that perpetuates racist stereotypes and I'm not ok with that.\n\n&gt;Making positive progress in terms of income, employment, wealth, etc. to get them to where they are today, despite the discrimination.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_minority#Possible_causes_of_model_minority_status\n\n&gt;Social behavior and norms. A culture that values education, hard work, and rule of law is infinitely more likely to succeed than one that does not value those things.\n\nWhere do you got that bullshit from? I mean education is fairly important as knowledge is power that way or another, but \"hard work\" is a \"subjective\" description. I mean slaves both in the historic and modern context can work really hard without having any benefit from that.\nAlso see the link about model minorities...\n\n&gt;Racists see color and judge. They don\u2019t get into a nuanced discussion of what it means to be in a racial category. So if racism against black people is a widespread issue in the US, then why wouldn\u2019t it act on black immigrants?\n\nDon't oversimplify things here, who can distinguish between \"White\", \"Irish\" and \"Jews\" not must be pretty \"sophisticated\" in his bullshit. That isn't a natural reaction that is trained behavior. And again that can be rooted in vetting procedures letting only high skilled people into the country, as well as structural racism that simply creates worse starting conditions. \n\n&gt;No.. because the people are in the same environment\u2026.. how can the environment be the distinguishing factor when it\u2019s a shared factor? Are you saying black immigrants don\u2019t experience racism in the US?\n\nIt's a shared factor after immigration. Up to that point you have different environments. Or are you talking about 2-3rd generation immigrants? Also do you have a control group to say that they aren't doing worse, than what they could? \n\n&gt;The sentencing isn\u2019t the same.\n\nYeah, but **WHY**? I mean one explanation is that powder cocaine is a drug for the wealthy, whereas crack has a cheap image and that the difference in sentencing is a racist discrimination.", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "date_year_month": "2019-03", "created_utc_converted": "2019-03-28 02:20:07", "score_overall": 4, "words": "libel silencing jewish conspiracy", "shared_words": "libel silencing jewish conspiracy", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "vzenov", "body": "Bullshit.\n\nThe US has not been an ally until around 1967-1973. The shift came in late 70s after oil-producing gulf countries had to be controlled once dollar went off gold in 1971. The attack on USS Liberty was not an act by an ally.   It is after US dollar becomes the only currency for trading oil and the reinvestment of oil profits from the Gulf becomes an issue that having Israel as a chained dog in the region really pays off.\n\nThe influence Jews had in opinion-shaping sectors of the economy like press, publishing, entertainment and academia has played a major role. The reason why there's so much screeching about \"anti-semitism\" and \"conspiracy theories\" is because it is a fact.  Not only it is a fact, there are direct connections between Israeli government and special services (in Israel there's no separation between intelligence and army and government it's a Soviet-style pseudo-democracy) and Jewish organizations in the US and US government (primarily in the Republican party after Reagan) promoting a specific narrative. The ideas of \"new anti-semitism\" begin in America in 1970s but it really takes off after 1982 when Israel invades Lebanon and war crimes happen.\n\nThose people helped to sell the \"religious reasons\"  to dumb Americans as means of making the justification less dependent on objective factors.  Make it about religion and no amount of human rights and international law violations by Israel can change your mind. But they were even more instrumental in silencing criticism from the left by creating a narrative about the holocaust and the creation of state of Israel which is contrary to historical fact.  Critics call it the \"holocaust industry\" - a phrase coined by Jewish scholar Norman Finkelstein.  It was so efficient that only the most hardcore leftists like Finkelstein or Chomsky and the people who listen to them  resisted it.\n\nThe expansion of Israeli arms industry which is funded supported and aided by the US is the result and not the cause of US-Israeli relationship. America doesn't need Israeli weapons because Israel buys US weapons with US aid. America makes Israel dependent so it plays by American rules and then Israel retaliates by using all resources at its disposal to make sure US plays by Israeli rules.\n\nThe result is that US energy companies get their oil, US banking gets their money, US defense industry get their sales and right-wing Zionists get their Greater Israel For Jews Only.

{"author": "RighteousKill66", "body": "Thank you in advance for answering my questions. \n\nBut I must begin by saying that I feel that Jews in general don't receive criticism very well. Any comment that vaguely contains a critique of a Jewish person is often called anti-Semitic without any attention to the validity of the claim. If someone criticises the Catholic Church for their problem of priests molesting children, such a critique is not inherently anti-Catholic. Often in the media, any political or academic figure that even questions Israel is slandered as an anti-semite and has their careers ruined. And laws are often put in place that put people in jail for any criticism of Jews. Many European countries put people in jail for simply doubting the exact number of Jews that died during the Holocaust. \n\nThe detriment that Jews have been to their host society and the unpleasant things that I've heard about them can both be grouped together under rumors, but I'm hoping that you can dispel these rumors.\n\nJews financed and were the intellectual leaders of the Bolshivek Revolution that killed millions of people.\n\nJEWISH RELIGIOUS PRACTICES\n\nFirst, if what I hear about Jewish religious practices are true, then I don't want Jews in any country let alone a Catholic monarchy.\n\nJews giving babies herpes because rabbis put their mouth on the baby's penis after the circumscion.\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2013/04/07/health/new-york-neonatal-herpes/index.html\n\nJewish views on Gentiles:\nThe following is a quote by Rabbi Yitzhak Ginsburgh in Jewish Week. Can you please confirm or deny the theological validity of the following statement:\n\n\" Gentile souls are of a completely different and inferior order. They are totally evil, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. ...If every simple cell in a Jewish body entails divinity, is a part of God, then every strand of DNA is a part of God. Therefore, something is special about Jewish DNA. ...\n\nIf a Jew needs liver, can you take the liver of an innocent non-Jew passing by to save him? The Torah would probably permit that. Jewish life has an infinite value. There is something infinitely more holy and unique about Jewish life than non-Jewish life.\"\n(end quote)\n\nHere is another quote from a Rabbi known as the Great Rebbe, whom I believe is a highly honored religious figure\n\n\"A Jew was not created as a means for some [other] purpose; he himself is the purpose, since the substance of all [Divine] emanations was created only to serve the Jews.\"\n\nAnother rumor that I have heard is that Jews have a burning hatred for Jesus Christ and that some Jews forbid his name from even being uttered. \n\n\"according to the Jewish Talmud, Jesus is perhaps the vilest being who ever lived, condemned to spend eternity in the bottommost pit of Hell, immersed in a boiling vat of excrement. Religious Jews regard the Muslim Quran as just another book, though a totally mistaken one, but the Christian Bible represents purest evil, and if circumstances permit, burning Bibles is a very praiseworthy act. Pious Jews are also enjoined to always spit three times at any cross or church they encounter, and direct a curse at all Christian cemeteries. Indeed, many deeply religious Jews utter a prayer each and every day for the immediate extermination of all Christians.\"\n\nAnother rumor is that Jews believe that it is their duty to dominate and enslave Gentiles for all eternity.\n\nThe following rumors about Jewish religious practices are from a book review of Israel Shahak's books on Jewish history and Jewish Fundamentalism.\n\n \"Religious Jews apparently pray to Satan almost as readily as they pray to God, and depending upon the various rabbinical schools, the particular rituals and sacrifices they practice may be aimed at enlisting the support of the one or the other\"\n\n\"On the most basic level, the religion of most traditional Jews is actually not at all monotheistic, but instead contains a wide variety of different male and female gods, having quite complex relations to each other, with these entities and their properties varying enormously among the numerous different Jewish sub-sects, depending upon which portions of the Talmud and the Kabala they place uppermost. For example, the traditional Jewish religious cry \u201cThe Lord Is One\u201d has always been interpreted by most people to be an monotheistic affirmation, and indeed, many Jews take exactly this same view. But large numbers of other Jews believe this declaration instead refers to achievement of sexual union between the primary male and female divine entities\"\n\n\"many of the traditional rituals are explicitly intended to fool or trick God or His angels or sometimes Satan, much like the mortal heroes of some Greek legend might seek to trick Zeus or Aphrodite. For example, certain prayers must be uttered in Aramaic rather than Hebrew on the grounds that holy angels apparently don\u2019t understand the former language, and their confusion allows those verses to slip by unimpeded and take effect without divine interference\"\n\n\" Indeed, the primary reason for the existence of non-Jews is to serve as the slaves of Jews, with some very high-ranking rabbis occasionally stating this well-known fact. In 2010, Israel\u2019s top Sephardic rabbi\u00a0[used his weekly sermon to declare]\u00a0that the only reason for the existence of non-Jews is to serve Jews and do work for them. The enslavement or extermination of all non-Jews seems an ultimate implied goal of the religion.\n\nJewish lives have infinite value, and non-Jewish ones none at all, which has obvious policy implications. For example, in a published article a prominent Israeli rabbi explained that if a Jew needed a liver, it would be perfectly fine, and indeed obligatory, to kill an innocent Gentile and take his\"\n\n\"according to mainstream Talmudic doctrine, black Africans are traditionally placed somewhere between people and monkeys in their intrinsic nature\"\n\nAnd finally, possibly the most egregious rumor is that of blood libel that was also mentioned in another comment. The idea that medieval Jews would kidnap Christian children and use their blood for rituals. Before you immediately dismiss this claim I would like to point out that extensive research has been done on the topic of blood passovers.\n\nhttp://www.unz.com/ishamir/the-bloody-passovers-of-dr-toaff/\n\n\n\nI apologize for the obscene amount of block quotes but I would appreciate a Jewish perspective on any of the above claims. \n\n \n\n\n\n", "score": 0, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "monarchism", "date_year_month": "2019-03", "created_utc_converted": "2019-03-28 16:46:04", "score_overall": 25, "words": "jewish holocaust jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jew jew jewish jewish jewish jew jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jewish jew libel jewish", "shared_words": "jewish holocaust jew libel", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "fairlyintrigued", "body": "Wow ok. I guess to start, it is clear you are big onto the conspiracy and possibly Neo-Nazi/White nationalist reading lists. But here goes nothing (in order):\n\n1) Metzitzah b'peh: it is not required in Jewish law to actually have a mohel touch his mouth to a baby's penis after circumcision. The overwhelming majorities of mohels use a straw or gauze pad to accomplish the same goal of removing the blood from the cut area. There are a very small number of Hasidic communities that continue to do metzitzah b'peh in the traditional way, but they are certainly not a majority and even those communities are beginning to stop the practice. \n\n2) Rabbi Ginsburgh is a radical who has been disavowed by every major rabbinical organization on the planet, including those of the so-called \"ultra Orthodox.\" Jewish law forbids harming another person to help oneself, and specifically states that there are three sins for which a Jew must commit suicide before he commits: murder, adultery and idolatry. Murder is not limited to the murder of another Jew, it is for all human beings. As such, it would certainly not be allowed to take the liver of a gentile.\n\n3) I don't know who the \"great Rebbe\" is. \"Rebbe\" is an honorific title given to the leader of a specific Hasidic movement, of which there are well over 100. Many of them refer to either their current or past leaders as \"great rebbe.\" The quote referenced is also incredibly vague. Jews have the idea that our purpose is to fulfill the word of God and His plan with the earth. The plan has nothing to do with serving the Jews, contrary, Jews are about serving God. \n\n4) I'm not sure where that quote comes from, but Jesus is not mentioned in the Talmud. There are a few vague references to a man from Nazareth referred to as a false messiah, but regardless he is certainly not considered a vile person. I'm a \"deeply religious Jew\" and I have certainly never heard of a prayer calling for the extermination of any person or group. Judaism is the only religion that states one can ascend to the afterlife without believing in its tenets. Judaism states that gentiles only need to follow the 7 Noahide laws to ascend to the Garden of Eden, and both Christian and Muslim religious practice are fully compliant with those laws. Jews do not hold the New Testament or the Quran as the word of God, but I've never heard anyone refer to them as \"evil.\" There also is no requirement to burn a Bible, spit at a cross or curse cemeteries - no Jewish law directs Jewish action towards any other group, except that respecting the laws of the country in which they reside holds the same level of religious responsibility as the religious laws themselves.\n\n5) Jews have no desire to enslave or dominate Gentiles. The sole goal of the Jewish people is to reestablish God's temple in Jerusalem and live in peace amongst the family of nations in the Land of Israel. That, according to Jewish law, is considered the age of redemption.\n\n6) Jews are forbidden to pray to anyone or anything that is not God Himself. The fundamental tenet of Judaism is the unity of God (\"Hear o Israel, the Lord is God, the Lord is One\"). \"Praying to Satan\" is completely forbidden, as would be praying to \"male\" and \"female\" gods. There is no such thing. \n\n7) The only prayer that is said in Aramaic is the Kaddish, a prayer for mourners. It is traditionally said in Aramaic because that was the language of the common Jew, and it is a hugely important commandment to say the prayer for a family member when it is required, and making it in Aramaic was easier for Jews at the time. Regardless, any prayer can be said in any language and is received the same by God. Prayers are also only said directly to God and never to angels or prophets, so the larger point is irrelevant. \n\n8) Rabbi Ovadia Yosef did say the first part of the quote, and was immediately condemned by rabbis across the world: \"Rabbi Yosef\u2019s remarks \u2014 suggesting outrageously that Jewish scripture asserts non-Jews exist to serve Jews \u2014 are abhorrent and an offense to human dignity and human equality,\u201d said AJC Executive Director David Harris. \"Judaism first taught the world that all individuals are created in the divine image, which helped form the basis of our moral code. A rabbi should be the first, not the last, to reflect that bedrock teaching of our tradition.\" \n\n9) The blood libel is the most heinous charge ever put against the Jews and it is completely false. I have no doubt that certain anti-Semites would try to prove that it is real, but I promise you it is not.

However, what has remained constant (at least since the Babylonian exile when the Torah was written down) is a belief in one god, the Torah\u2019s 613 commandments, the belief in a messiah (who according to the Torah needs to be directly descended from King David and bring peace in his lifetime- which is why to Jews Jesus does no qualify). The reason Jesus was controversial in his lifetime was because while he acknowledged   the sacredness of the Torah, he saw a lot of hypocrisy and preached that ultimately it\u2019s more important to just be a good person instead of worrying about breaking one of the 613 commandments of the Torah. *I don\u2019t care what religion someone is- this is just common sense!

{"author": "wolfie379", "body": "A few more fun tidbits. Before the time of St. Paul, anyone wanting to convert to Christianity first had to convert to Judaism. He made a slight (but ultimately disastrous) simplification in the New Testament. He replaced a term meaning \"specific group within the hierarchy of the clergy\" (any Jew at the time would have understood what the term meant, but outsiders probably wouldn't) in the section describing who wanted to have Jesus executed with \"Jews\". So long as Christianity was a fringe sect within Judaism, it was pretty much harmless. The trouble started when Christians began to outnumber Jews. Also, under the law that existed at the time, only the Roman government could order an execution. Major religious festival with people coming from the surrounding region? That's got the potential for trouble. Clergy rent space on the temple grounds to vendors of supplies for the festival? No problem, they're the ones running the temple. Carpenter's kid starts knocking over the stalls? Gotta get that troublemaker locked up before he starts a riot. He spouts all sorts of religious jumbo-jumbo? Just another nut. He claims to be King of the Jews? Whoa! \"King\" is the guy sitting on a fancy chair telling people what to do, that guy is a threat to Caesar's rule.\n\nIn Communion, the wafer is symbolic of the Body of Christ and the wine is symbolic of the Blood of Christ - if you oversimplify it, you wind up with ritual cannibalism. Ironic that Christians are one of the groups spouting the Blood Libel. It's even worse when Moslems spout it.\n\nBit of background (for people not familiar with the Blood Libel). Purim is a festival celebrating a victory over the Persians, an event that happened before the time of Julius Caesar (well-known, secular figure so unlikely to be any controversy over whether or not he existed, makes a convenient time marker). The Blood Libel is a claim that one ingredient in the cakes made for this festival is the blood of Christian children (Moslems extend it to include the blood of Moslem children). Christians are followers of the teachings of Jesus, Moslems are the followers of the teachings of Allah, as written down by Mohammed. Before Jesus, there could be no Christians. Before Mohammed, there could be no Moslems. Both Jesus and Mohammed lived after the time of Julius Caesar, so at the time of the victory over the Persians (and when the rituals for the celebration of Purim were created), what those who spout the Blood Libel claim to be a key ingredient of the cakes did not exist.\n\nWhy is it worse when Moslems spout the Blood Libel? Their own holy book says that when travelling away from their people, \"You may eat food prepared by Jews\" (a lot of similarity between Kosher and Halal dietary laws - with the exception of alcohol, the only \"one way\" compatibility I know of is when Halal allows something but Kosher doesn't). The Purim cakes are \"food prepared by Jews\" (after all, they're edible, and they're intended for a Jewish religious festival). Note that the Moslem holy book doesn't say \"You may eat food prepared by Jews, except for the Purim cakes, which you must not touch under any circumstances\". Moslems spouting the Blood Libel either know that they're lying, or (if they truly believe it) they're acknowledging that their holy book explicitly allows them to practice cannibalism.", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "entitledparents", "date_year_month": "2019-03", "created_utc_converted": "2019-03-29 22:05:38", "score_overall": 10, "words": "jew libel libel libel libel libel kosher kosher jewish libel", "shared_words": "jew libel kosher jewish", "socre_distint": 4}
{"author": "religiousreader", "body": "&gt;Post an example of a Jewish 'unfounded conspiracy theory' you can disprove.\n\nHolocaust denial is a big one. Considering in the 20th century alone the amount of deaths perpetuated by people's own governments it's no surprise that at the very least several million Jews were killed as a scapegoat by the Nazis. The real enemy was the French and British, for their Versailles Treaty that kept them eternally poor. The concentration camps were modelled after the British camps in South Africa and the Spanish internment camps in Cuba. It wasn't a new idea at the time, and Hitler brought the idea home. Considering the conditions in those camps, it is no surprise so many people died, and it would reflect pretty poorly on the Germans if the whole thing was simply an \"accident\".\n\n&gt;It can be proven very easily that Jews control the vast majority of news media, it can be proven they control almost the entire entertainment industry, it can be proven their lobby controls US foreign policy, a Jewish family are behind the opioid crisis that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and ruined the lives of millions more, they are massively over represented in Ivy League schools when compared to high school high achievers, how?\n\nI think that is all extremely worrying, and maybe it says something about the US' sympathy towards Jewish people that is unfounded. However, we can't ignore the fact that when they get into these high powered positions they generally succeed. Does that not also say something about the Jewish people? There is clearly a culture there of competitiveness and business savvy-ness that is pushed on them at a  young age. Not only that, but it's been well reported that Jewish families tend to stay together and that has a huge effect on if someone succeeds or not. As for the negative effects of the things these corporations do, like the opioid crisis... Maybe it's pure maliciousness, or maybe it's simply stupidity. I know one ethnic Jew in my personal life however she is Christian, and also a bank teller. That's just the role she was comfortable with. But from what I've seen in the media, American Jewish people can be summed up like this:\n\nOptimistic, intelligent, sheltered, competitive.\n\nIf it were my call, I'd say they just suffer from liberalism. They are not actively thinking \"Let's kill these goyim and also make a profit to help fund our genocide.\" Instead, they are thinking, \"With these institutions, we can spread wealth and prosperity to the best of our ability.\" Not realizing that they are causing another host of problems as a result of their supposed compassion. Liberalism is an active denial of reality where no consequences may occur, and since it seems these atheist/Jewish CEOs were probably very sheltered as kids, they have a warped view of how the world really works, and the corruption and messiness of business gets in the way of that original liberal ideal of helping others. See Facebook and their CEO for a solid example of this.\n\n&gt;They make up the majority of major party donours, [in the 2016 election 9/10 top democrat donours were Jewish and 4/10 top republicans](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateFascism/comments/9afxo2/how_do_you_as_a_fascist_respond_to_the/e4vpewq/?context=3).\n\nThis also proves my point that most American Jews suffer from liberalism.\n\n&gt;You can go through and verify these facts for yourself, they aren't secrets.\n\nYep, and while I believe the more objective facts that you've presented I still interpret them differently because of my own perspective. Hopefully you can show me something about Jewish people that doesn't imply they are a monolith.\n\n&gt;I hate our political system, I hate the media, I hate the entertainment business, I hate big pharma, I hate banks, I hate insurance companies etc. All of these are dominated by Jews.\n\n&gt;Everything that is making our people depressed, high time preference, consumeristic, materialistic, less close to nature and spirituality etc are either completely or largely controlled by Jews. You can empirically prove this, there's no unfounded conspiracy theory there are things that are harming our people and they all happen to be run by Jews. If they weren't Jews and it was white people we would still hate those things, just like the 'alt lite' do, it's just that we explicitly point out the fact that these people all mysteriously happen to be Jewish.\n\nThis is the part that gets me worried about your intentions. Do you hate these institutions because they are inherently bad or because they are run by Jewish people? You, me, and many others have benefitted from these institutions one time or another and some were around even before Jewish  people got ahold of them. Insurance companies are very beneficial. So are pharma companies, especially when they are run correctly and not maliciously. Same goes for banks. The only one I can agree to see go away are the media and entertainment companies, because they don't add much social value. However, I think that the people who are attracted that industry are already bad and naive to begin with, Jewish or not.\n\n&gt;Check out 'Culture of Critique for normies' on Youtube, it's less than an hour long and will show you how many academic and social movements that are harmful to society have been run by Jews.\n\nI'm on limited data right now but in a couple days I'll look it up and watch it.", "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "DebateAltRight", "date_year_month": "2019-03", "created_utc_converted": "2019-03-29 14:47:54", "score_overall": 19, "words": "jewish conspiracy holocaust scapegoat jewish jewish jewish jewish jew jewish goyim jewish jewish jewish conspiracy jewish jewish jewish jewish", "shared_words": "jewish conspiracy holocaust scapegoat jew goyim", "socre_distint": 6}

{"author": "Vallerius", "body": "Ford's antisemitism is well documented and there is another AskHistory thread with a decent answer to a similar [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/382xaf/was_henry_ford_an_antisemite_a_nazi_sympathizer/).\n\nI would argue that Ford's antisemitism and notorious belief in conspiracy theories are interrelated and fed each other. As for which came first? I don't think there is an answer for that particular question that I am aware of.\n\nAfter the publishing of some negative stories in the Chicago Tribune in 1919, Ford sued the paper for libel. In that court case he was deposed and his testimony is one the possible origination of his famous quote \"History is bunk.\" while the transcript never puts those words in that order, it does appear that Ford believed that history was less about the facts of the past and more about perceptions and power.\n\nAfter losing the case, he acquired the Dearborn Independent, a struggling newspaper local newspaper to his factories, he placed one of his lieutenants E.G. Liebold in charge of the paper and closely supervised the stories and reporting that it printed. One of the series the paper published was \"The International Jew\" which attempted to prove that a conspiracy theory that a international cabal of Jewish financiers and bankers controlled politics and history.  The publication of this series was influential in the dissemination of antisemitic ideologies throughout its time in print. The series would published the Protocols of Zion, which remain one of the most influential pieces of antisemitic writings, and other stories.\n\nFord was incredibly interested in proving his vision of history and printed many associated stories including some rather strange tales. Ford at one point picked a book called  *The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth* by Finis Bates (1907) which he found fascinating. Bates alleged he had met John Wilkes Booth in Texas long after his official death in 1865 shortly after the assassination of President Lincoln. Bates would eventually become the owner of a mummified corpse which he claimed proved Booth lived for years after the fact and would appear often at sideshows and carnivals around the country. Bates argued that Booth's survival was possible due to the fact that he was in league with Vice President Andrew Johnson who had \"conspired\" to kill Lincoln in order to become president himself and cover up the fact that Booth had survived.\n\nFord was intrigued with the story and believed that the conspiracy to kill Lincoln extended beyond Johnson and was done in part because Lincoln had implemented a monetary policy that had angered Jewish Canadian bankers. So Ford connected the dots. Needless to say, while the Booth conspiracy Bates  laid out, and the many other versions, were never proven or provide any reasonable evidence, Ford ended up printing the story in \"the International Jew\" as another example of how Jewish Bankers dominated history.\n\nThere have been many serious historical studies of antisemitic thought and its origins but in Ford's case, it appears that his antisemitism developed a long side his other conspiratorial ways of thinking. However there is very little about his antisemitism that is unique, Ford simply had the wealth and capabilities to spread his ideas but many others shared them. Other prominent figures shared similar view points. A few years after Ford shut down the Independent and made a public apology about his antisemitic politics a Catholic priest a few miles away in Royal Oak, MI at the National Shrine of the Little Flower began broadcasting a well-known radio show. Father Coughlin would deliver tirades against Jewish bankers throughout the 30s and became a vocal supporter of fascism. So Henry Ford cannot be considered the only figure participating in antisemitic propaganda  and both Ford and Coughlin hint at a larger supportive audience of Americans who shared their antisemitic views.\n\nSources:\n\nMax Wallace. *The American Axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh and the Rise of the Third Reich*.

It literally never meant that. It's simply not a phenomenon that exists, beyond a defense for Arab antisemitism.\n\n&gt;The root word [*Semite*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Semite) gives the [false impression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misnomer) that antisemitism is directed against all [Semitic people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_people), *e.g.*, including [Arabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs) and [Assyrians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_people). The compound word *antisemite* was popularized in Germany in 1879[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBein1990595-7) as a scientific-sounding term for *Judenhass* (\"Jew-hatred\"),[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChanes2004150-8)[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism#cite_note-FOOTNOTERattansi20074%E2%80%935-9)[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism#cite_note-FOOTNOTERoth200330-10)[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJohnston198327-11)[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism#cite_note-laqueur1-12) and this has been its common use since then.[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJohnson1987133-13)[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism#cite_note-JustJews-14)\n\nAnd just FYI, the Syrians aren't just \"criticizing a foreign government\". They're an openly antisemitic regime, who invited David Duke to make an antisemitic speech, and broadcast it on live state TV, teach their kids that \"treason and deception are part of the Jews attributes\" in the state-mandated schoolbooks, and only teach a single Shakespeare play in schools - the Merchant of Venice. And to make it clear, it's because \"the play shamefully reveals the depths of a Jewish usurer, and the greed and avarice he pursues by every possible means\".\n\nI should also note that Syria had a big and ancient Jewish community, but it's currently 100% Jew-free, since all the Jews ran for their lives after a series of pogroms in the 1940's, and a series of measures that forbid Jews from owning property, serving in the government, or even getting a driver's license. All while proudly granting asylum and a state pension to Alois Brunner, Adolf Eichmann's right-hand man, and a key architect of the Holocaust.\n\nSo yeah, the Syrian government is very antisemitic, in the fullest, most traditional sense of the word. And trying to reduce it to \"criticizing a foreign government\" is just excusing antisemitism.", "score": 0, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "nottheonion", "date_year_month": "2019-03", "created_utc_converted": "2019-03-31 21:43:17", "score_overall": 7, "words": "jew merchant jewish greed jewish jew holocaust", "shared_words": "jew merchant jewish greed holocaust", "socre_distint": 5}
