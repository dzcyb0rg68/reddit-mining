From todays perspective we view this as schizophrenic, but back then it really wasn't.\n\nWhy was there a swimming pool (and other nice stuff) in Auschwitz? Well, there could be many reasons.

{"author": "Wrokotamie", "body": "Classes of Left-Wing Anti-Semite (From Personal Observation):\n\n**Self-conscious/overt:** Their beliefs are not dissimilar to those of right-wing anti-Semites, with the primary difference lying in who they believe is being helped and hurt by the \"Jewish conspiracy.\" Unlike right-wing anti-Semites, who believe that whites are being systematically eradicated in a \"great replacement\" in favor of people of color by Jewish hands, they believe that Jews seek to further the oppression of disempowered groups in developed countries and further the economic, militaristic, and political subjugation of the Global South. They may or may not be Islamists or hardcore Palestinian nationalists. Many, however, only sympathize with the Palestinian cause because they see it as anti-Jewish; actual advocacy for Palestine is secondary. There's also some degree of intersection with \"classical\" Christian anti-Jewish bigotry and its motifs. Telltale beliefs include: Jews dominating the Atlantic slave trade; Holocaust denialism; Jews planned the Iraq War, 9/11, and the subsequent War on Terrorism. There are relatively few self-conscious anti-Semites on the left in Western countries, and even fewer who will outright state their hatred for Jews. However, figures like Jackie Walker, George Galloway, or Ken Livingstone (in the UK) or Tamika Mallory (in the US), pretty clearly fall into this category.\n\n**Tacit:** The kind of anti-Semite you are most likely to find on the left. They don't believe Jews are trying to actively destroy the world, but they don't like or are at least suspicious of Jews (except for a few \"progressive\" ones who are kosher). They believe \"real\" anti-Semitism is an exclusively right-wing force. To them, left-wing anti-Semitism is a right-wing fiction, one that's designed to silence forces speaking out against capitalism, corrupt political interests, the US military-industrial complex, and US foreign policy (particularly regarding but not limited to Israel-Palestine). For example, they believe that the supposed anti-Semitism of Corbyn's Labour is a conspiracy cooked up to stop his establishment of a socialist society in Britain, standing up to the US war machine, etc. To the degree that anti-Semitism does exist on the left or arise in criticism of Israel's behavior towards Palestine, they believe that it's insignificant or excusable in the grand scheme of things. They believe anti-Zionism is definitely not anti-Semitism, even if the content is identical. Many are extremely emotionally invested in Israel-Palestine, even if they have no personal connection to the conflict.\n\nThey also tend to assume all Jews are white and affluent, basing their perceptions on the US population, and that anti-Semitism and the Holocaust receive excessive attention because a.) their victims are/were \"white\", in the American sense of race or b.) it deflects/distracts/detracts from the victims of *real* oppression. Generally, they have the notion that Jews complain too much and Jewish concerns take up too much space. There's a belief that those on the left accused of anti-Semitism are the actual victims, and that such accusations are in themselves a deceptive act of violence (see: the insane criticism of Chelsea Clinton as having caused the right-wing Islamophobic Christchurch attack.) They also tend to particularly distrust or focus on Jews in positions of power in institutions they don't like, and believe Jewish overrepresentation in the media, government, or financial industries is negative. For example, they might focus on Henry Kissinger over all other Cold War Secretaries of State.\n\n**Passive:** They do not hold considered anti-Semitic views, and might even fervently express their opposition to anti-Semitism in some cases, but are tolerant of anti-Semitism when it's expressed by people on the left they generally agree with.", "score": 13, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "centerleftpolitics", "date_year_month": "2019-04", "created_utc_converted": "2019-04-02 01:46:18", "score_overall": 11, "words": "jewish conspiracy jewish jewish jewish holocaust kosher conspiracy holocaust jewish jewish", "shared_words": "jewish conspiracy holocaust kosher", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "HaLoGuY007", "body": "Jonathan Freedland is a columnist for the Guardian based in London; Mehdi Hasan is a senior contributor to The Intercept based in Washington DC.\n\n&gt; The two of us have been having the exact same conversation for the past decade. About antisemitism and Islamophobia. One of us a Muslim, the other a Jew, we have conducted it in public and in private, on Twitter and on TV. We\u2019ve agreed; we\u2019ve argued; we\u2019ve even wandered off topic to trade tips on how to get through a fast. Now we\u2019ve come together because of the urgent and common threat that we face. Both of our communities are under violent attack from far-right white supremacists.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Christchurch, New Zealand, last month a white supremacist gunned down 50 Muslims at prayer. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, last October a white supremacist gunned down 11 Jews at prayer. Both killers were clear in their loathing of both Jews and Muslims. Both subscribed to the \u201cgreat replacement theory\u201d, which casts Muslims and other minorities as \u201cinvaders\u201d of western societies and a threat to white, Christian majorities. In this narrative, the supposed invasion is a wicked plot orchestrated by the same hidden hand behind all malign events through world history: the Jews. The point was put concisely in an online remark reposted by the Pittsburgh murderer: \u201cIt\u2019s the filthy EVIL jews Bringing the Filthy EVIL Muslims into the Country!!\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; This is how our haters see us: Jews and Muslims connected in a joint enterprise to effect a \u201cwhite genocide\u201d. It is an unhinged and racist conspiracy theory \u2013 and it has both of our communities in its murderous sights. So there can only be one response: Muslims and Jews must stand and fight it together.\n&gt; \n&gt; We realise this will not be easy. Both of us are deeply rooted in our respective communities, and we know them well enough to recognise that there are plenty of Jews and Muslims who have long seen the other as an opponent, even as an enemy. Given the deep connection that Jews and Muslims feel with Israel/Palestine, that is perhaps unsurprising.\n&gt; \n&gt; We understand how this has come about. Jews and Muslims have spilled each other\u2019s blood, in acts of violence that have left deep scars. Jihadists have targeted Jews across continental Europe, whether it be the killing of children in a school in Toulouse in 2012 or shoppers at a kosher supermarket in Paris in 2015. Muslims share the pain of Palestinians living through more than half a century of brutal Israeli occupation, with regular eruptions of violence that have left civilians, including children, dead. To be clear: we are not playing a game of moral equivalence here; rather, we are recognising the reasons for mutual antagonism.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nor are we denying that there is much prejudice within each community towards the other. Witness the leader of a New Zealand mosque who recently suggested that the massacre in Christchurch was the secret handiwork of Mossad: an age-old, anti-Jewish conspiracy theory in contemporary garb. Or listen to the interfaith activist appalled to discover that a Facebook group of her fellow British Jews was awash with anti-Muslim racism. Across the Muslim-majority world, anti-Jewish tropes and conspiracies have been endorsed and even repopularised. In the US, right-wing Jewish figures have been among the most prominent supporters of the \u201cIslamophobia network\u201d. There is a shared error here: both the Muslim who hates Jews and the Jew who hates Muslims forget that the white supremacist hates them both. But that such people exist is proof that the narrative of white supremacism does not just infect white communities \u2013 it can infect us all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just as we acknowledge that the communities we were born into harbour prejudice, so we are ready to say the same of our chosen political community. We need no lectures on the importance of tackling antisemitism and Islamophobia on the left as well as on the right. Both of us have condemned Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party for its failure to tackle anti-Jewish racism within its ranks, while one of us has discussed the importance of avoiding antisemitic tropes in conversation with the controversial Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who herself has been the victim of liberal Islamophobes. Both of us have condemned anti-Muslim bigotry in liberal-left circles too, whether it be the British scientist Richard Dawkins comparing Islam to cancer less than a fortnight after the Christchurch massacre, or US TV show host Bill Maher referring to Islam as \u201cthe mafia\u201d.\n&gt; \n&gt; But this is no time for whataboutism. Yes, the jihadist threat to Jews has not gone away. Yes, some liberals have an Islamophobia problem, while some on the left are guilty of antisemitism, both of which can cause our communities to feel fearful and isolated. Fascism, however, is back with a vengeance. The growing and lethal threat to life and limb for Muslims and Jews is now coming not from the far left but from an emboldened and violent far right. In the US, in 2018, every single one of the 50 extremist-related murders was linked to the far right, according to the Anti-Defamation League. In the UK, according to the Home Office, between 2017 and 2018 the number of white suspects arrested for terror offences outstripped those of any other ethnic group \u2013 the first time in more than a decade. In Germany, official figures suggest that nine out of 10 antisemitic crimes in 2017 were perpetrated by members of far-right or neo-Nazi groups.\n&gt; \n&gt; Should we be surprised? White supremacists are on the march. They see Islam as incompatible with western life. We reject that claim wholeheartedly. Jews too were long told their faith had no place in western society: they were wrong about Judaism and they are wrong about Islam.\n&gt; \n&gt; That these two hatreds are linked on the right is clear, and not only in the minds of deranged killers. A recent Pew survey of 15 western European countries found that \u201cattitudes toward Jews and Muslims are highly correlated with each other. People who express negative opinions about Muslims are more likely than others to also express negative views of Jews.\u201dIn the US, a Gallup study in 2010found people \u201cwho say they feel \u2018a great deal\u2019 of prejudice\u2026 toward Jews are about 32 times as likely to report feeling \u2018a great deal\u2019 of prejudice toward Muslims\u201d. Put simply, the kind of people who hate one of us are more likely to hate the other too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Such people are animated by a racist ideology that goes wide and deep, amplified by powerful politicians of the right at the highest levels. Take Donald Trump, who says \u201cIslam hates us\u201d, and bans Muslims from five countries \u2013 but also rails against \u201cglobalists\u201d, understood by antisemites as code for Jews, and in particular, the antisemites\u2019 favourite bogeyman, George Soros. Or top Brexiter Nigel Farage, who speaks of a \u201cJewish lobby\u201d and condemns Soros as \u201cthe biggest danger to the entire western world\u201d \u2013 but has also denounced \u201cwholly Muslim\u201d areas of London and gave us the infamous \u201cBreaking Point\u201d poster.\n&gt; \n&gt; In our view, it is no coincidence that the rise of Trump and Brexit has been matched by a rise in hate crimes on both sides of the Atlantic targeting both of our communities. In the US, hate crimes against Jews rose by more than a third and accounted for 58% of all religion-based hate crimes in 2017, with Muslims in second place, while in the UK, more than half of religiously motivated attacks in 2018 were aimed at Muslims, with Jews not far behind.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the climate in which we are both worried about the safety of our children. We share each other\u2019s fears. And we both welcome signs that others are beginning to do the same. It\u2019s heartening that Muslim groups raised more than $200,000 for bereaved families at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, and heartening too that the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh is now raising money for the victims of the New Zealand mosque attacks.\n&gt; \n&gt; They are setting an example for us all.

{"author": "ilikesteel", "body": "So you're opening a bit of a can of worms.  Jews are often disliked because they're historically a very tight nit, sometimes closed community, historically (but not anymore) relegated to just a few professions that allow people to view them as alien/other/scheming.\n\nMost modern Western anti-Semitism has its roots in the Middle Ages in and the Middle East.  Jews were a minority population in both places not allowed to work the land or own it or often to join guilds.  They were relegated to trade, medicine, and moneylending.  That's about it.\n\nThis last thing, moneylending, is super important.  It was a key tenant of Christianity then, and is still a big factor of Islam in several places in the MENA, that moneylending is a sin.  So, in order to extend and receive loans, the nobility of a city or country would allow Jews into a quarter of their city in order to be moneylenders.  Desperate people took out loans from the Jews.  The Jews, in return, were taxed at upwards of 90%.  As a result, Jewish populations were villainized for their high interest rates, when in reality they made next to no money and the nobility made a fortune.  Then, the nobility would borrow from the Jews to fund wars.  If the nobility got into too much debt, they would often expel the Jews and seize their assets or call a progrom and kill/expel them by force.\n\nImagine what effect creating a whole social/ethnic class to be a scapegoat for high interests loans would have.\n\nWhen the Black Death came, Jews were often held responsible.  Villagers and townspeople would kill the Jews to appease God and keep the plague away.\n\nIt was written into the Bible that the Jews, not the Romans, killed and crucified Christ.  There's a long history of calling Jews Christ kilers because of this.  Every year, towns and villages across Europe would hold Passion Plays, designed to foment hatred against Jews for killing Christ.  Easter time would be quite dangerous for the Jews of Europe.\n\nPeople didn't understand the holiday of Passover, and thought that Jews were kidnapping children for their matzo.  This is a particular lie known as the Blood Libel.\n\nIn the 1800's, eugenics became a fad, and several groups of nobles began to see Jews as an impediment to their empires and culture.  The Russian nobility funded a document called the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a book designed to foment hatred towards Jews through false conspiracy theories.\n\nTake that whole history, then add a whole bunch of officially sanctioned conspiracy theories, and things get worse.\n\nLately, there's been a tendency towards hating the Jews for founding the State of Israel.  This is, to say the least, uncomfortable history.  There is an argument over whether Jews forced Palestinians out of their homes to found the country or if they left voluntarily to avoid the wrath of Jordan, Egypt, and Lebanon bearing down on the incoming Jews, fresh from their torture in the Holocaust.  At the time, the vast majority of Jews in Israel were either in Israel already or had recently been expelled from nearby Muslim countries.  The whole conflict was really messed up.  Jews didn't have a home, in great danger, and desperate, but in the process of getting their own home a lot of people were hurt or expelled themselves.\n\nThis has introduced a new form of Jew hatred (only been around for 70 years) where people apply their anti-Semitism to Israel or their hatred of Israel onto Jews.  It's often subtle, but it's there.  There's a lot of room for criticism of Israel.  But to hold Israel to a different standard than other countries, or to demand their destruction/death, is obvious anti-Semitism.  Denying the complexity of Israeli politics to make Jews a monolith is also obvious anti-Semitism.

{"author": "fiztja", "body": "In contemporary usage, the term Cultural Marxism refers to an antisemitic conspiracy theory which claims that the Frankfurt School is part of a continual academic and intellectual effort to undermine and destroy Western culture. According to the conspiracy theory, which emerged in the late 1990s, the Frankfurt School and other Marxist theorists were part of a conspiracy to attack Western society by undermining traditionalist conservatism using the 1960s counterculture, multiculturalism, progressive politics and political correctness.\n\nThis conspiracy theory is associated with American religious paleoconservatives such as William S. Lind, Pat Buchanan, and Paul Weyrich; but also holds currency among the alt-right, white nationalist groups, and the neo-reactionary movement. Weyrich first laid out the conspiracy theory in a 1998 speech to the Civitas Institute's Conservative Leadership Conference, later repeating it in his widely syndicated \"culture war letter\". At Weyrich's request, William S. Lind wrote a short history of his conception of Cultural Marxism for the Free Congress Foundation; in it Lind identifies the presence of openly gay people on television as proof of Cultural Marxist control over the mass media and claims that Herbert Marcuse considered a coalition of \"blacks, students, feminist women, and homosexuals\" as a vanguard of cultural revolution. A year later, Lind began writing Victoria: A Novel of 4th Generation Warfare (published in 2014) about a societal apocalypse in which Cultural Marxism deposed traditionalist conservatism as the culture of the Western world; ultimately, a Christian military victory re-establishes traditionalist socio-economic order using the Victorian morality of Britain in the late 19th century.\n\nThe anti\u2013Marxism of Lind and Weyrich advocates political confrontation and intellectual opposition to Cultural Marxism with \"a vibrant cultural conservatism\" composed of \"retro-culture fashions\", a return to railroads as public transport, and an agrarian culture of self-reliance, modeled after that of the Amish. In the Dialectic of Counter-Enlightenment: The Frankfurt School as Scapegoat of the Lunatic Fringe (2011), the historian Martin Jay said that Lind's documentary of conservative counter-culture, Political Correctness: The Frankfurt School (1999), was effective propaganda, because it:\n\n&gt;... spawned a number of condensed textual versions, which were reproduced on a number of radical, right-wing sites. These, in turn, led to a welter of new videos, now available on YouTube, which feature an odd cast of pseudo-experts regurgitating exactly the same line. The message is numbingly simplistic: \u201cAll the ills of modern American culture, from feminism, affirmative action, sexual liberation and gay rights to the decay of traditional education, and even environmentalism, are ultimately attributable to the insidious [intellectual] influence of the members of the Institute for Social Research who came to America in the 1930s.\u201d\n\nHeidi Beirich likewise holds that the conspiracy theory is used to demonize various conservative \"b\u00eates noires\" including \"feminists, homosexuals, secular humanists, multiculturalists, sex educators, environmentalists, immigrants, and black nationalists\".\n\nAccording to Chip Berlet, who specializes in the study of far-right movements, the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory found a place within the Tea Party movement of 2009, with contributions published in the American Thinker and WorldNetDaily highlighted by some Tea Party websites.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has reported that William S. Lind in 2002 gave a speech at a Holocaust denial conference on the topic of Cultural Marxism. In this speech Lind noted that all the members of The Frankfurt School were \"to a man, Jewish\", but it is reported that Lind claims not to question whether the Holocaust occurred and suggests he was present in an official capacity for the Free Congress Foundation \"to work with a wide variety of groups on an issue-by-issue basis\".\n\nAlthough the theory became more widespread in the late 1990s and through the 2000s, the modern iteration of the theory originated in Michael Minnicino's 1992 essay \"New Dark Age: Frankfurt School and 'Political Correctness'\", published in Fidelio Magazine by the Schiller Institute. The Schiller Institute, a branch of the LaRouche movement, further promoted the idea in 1994. The Minnicino article charges that the Frankfurt School promoted Modernism in the arts as a form of cultural pessimism and shaped the counterculture of the 1960s (such as the British pop band The Beatles) after the Wandervogel movements of the Ascona commune.[65] According to Samuel Moyn, the fear of \"cultural Marxism\u201d is originally \"an American contribution to the phantasmagoria of the alt-right\", while the theory is \"a crude slander, referring to something that does not exist\".\n\nMore recently, the Norwegian terrorist Anders Behring Breivik included the term in his document \"2083: A European Declaration of Independence\", which\u2014along with The Free Congress Foundation's Political Correctness: A Short History of an Ideology\u2014was e-mailed to 1,003 addresses approximately 90 minutes before the 2011 bomb blast in Oslo for which Breivik was responsible. Segments of William S. Lind's writings on Cultural Marxism have been found within Breivik's manifesto.\n\nIn July 2017, Rich Higgins was removed by US National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster from the United States National Security Council following the discovery of a seven-page memorandum he had authored, describing a conspiracy theory concerning a plot to destroy the presidency of Donald Trump by Cultural Marxists, as well as Islamists, globalists, bankers, the media, and members of the Republican and Democratic parties.\n\nIn July 2018, the Twitter account of Ron Paul posted and then deleted a cartoon about Cultural Marxism which depicted racial stereotypes. Paul later claimed that he had not posted it personally.\n\nIn \"The Origins of Political Correctness\" (2000), William S. Lind established the ideologic lineage of Cultural Marxism; that: \"If we look at it analytically, if we look at it historically, we quickly find out exactly what it is. Political Correctness is cultural Marxism. It is Marxism translated from economic into cultural terms. It is an effort that goes back not to the 1960s and the Hippies and the peace movement, but back to World War I [to Kulturbolshewismus]. If we compare the basic tenets of Political Correctness with [the basic tenets of] classical Marxism, the parallels are very obvious.\" Such an historical lineage demonstrated that the ideology of \"The Alt-right\u2019s Favorite Meme is 100 Years Old\" (2018), in which Samuel Moyn reported that fear of Cultural Marxism is \"an American contribution to the phantasmagoria of the alt-right\"; while the conspiracy theory, itself, is \"a crude slander, referring to Judeo-Bolshevism, something that does not exist\".\n\nPhilosopher and political science lecturer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Jamin has stated that \"[n]ext to the global dimension of the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory, there is its innovative and original dimension, which lets its authors avoid racist discourses and pretend to be defenders of democracy\".\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School#Cultural_Marxism_conspiracy_theory", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "conspiracy", "date_year_month": "2019-04", "created_utc_converted": "2019-04-07 00:00:02", "score_overall": 14, "words": "conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy scapegoat conspiracy conspiracy holocaust jewish holocaust conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy", "shared_words": "conspiracy scapegoat holocaust jewish", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "unveiledignorance", "body": "So it\u2019s quite common for historians to categorise hatred of Jews to two main forms: Anti-Judaism and antisemitism. \n\nThe distinction between the two can be somewhat fuzzy, however the broad distinction is that the former justifies hatred based upon religion - i.e. characterising Jews as the killers of Christ- and antisemitism is based upon a sort of pseudoscientific conception of Jews as being a specific racial group - the result of the bastardisation of the biological theory applied to social Darwinism. \n\nFor hundreds of years in European history Jews were persecuted on the basis of their religion. This was often attached to the death of Christ, and to rumours and ideas which portrayed Jews as monsters. For example, a common accusation was of the Blood Libel, the false idea that Jews would murder Christian children as part of the Passover ritual. Further, Jews were frequently scapegoated for disasters, such as the Black Death in the 14th century. \n\nDuring this period, attempts were often made to try and convert Jews to Christianity, and the hatred was often based upon religion. However, towards the end of the Medieval period some began to create a more permanent characterisation of the supposed inherent evilness of Jews. Martin Luther became a vocal antagonist against the Jews, publishing a text called \u2018On the Jews and their lies\u2019 in 1543. In 1517 he wrote a letter which said: \n\n\u201cI have come to the conclusion that the Jews will always curse and blaspheme God and his King Christ, as all the prophets have predicted. He who neither reads nor understands this, as yet knows no theology, in my opinion...If they are trying to stop the Jews blaspheming, they are working to prove the Bible and God liars.\u201d\n\nConcurrently, in some contexts Jews began to face hatred based upon an association with exploitation and finance. This is largely due to the fact that in some areas of central and eastern Europe, Jews often served as tax collectors for local lords and authorities, thereby being viewed negatively by the local peasantry.\n\nHowever, over time the idea of \u2018Jewishness\u2019 as an immutable trait, and the racialised nature of what came to be antisemitism developed. \n\nWith the emergence of nationalism, people began to view the world as being split into distinctly separate races and national groups. Within this context, and the backdrop of historical persecution, Jews along with other groups which did not conform to the national majority within particular areas cane to be seen as , \u2018aliens\u2019 and racial outsiders. \n\nThe agenda of many nationalist groups which then developed was a reaction to this diversity. In the words of historian Donald Bloxam: \u201cEthnic dominance within a bounded territory was the basic, non-negotiable goal of all emerging nationalists\u201d. \n\nWith the transition from a religious to a racial hatred of the Jews, the perceived nature of the \u2018Jewish Question\u2019 went from one in which an individual could avoid persecution by assimilating into the dominant local religion, to one in which the very existence of the individual was viewed as undesirable. \n\nFurther, Jews were often unfairly associated with Bolshevism and revolutionary left-wing politics. Following the seizure of power by Lenin\u2019s Bolsheviks in Russia during 1917, the fear of the spread of Communism influenced the rise of anti-Jewish sentiment as a bi-product of anti-communism, particularly within some conservative circles. \n\nTherein, coupled with the historical context of hatred,conspiracy theories, political antagonism, and racial ideology drove the rise of antisemitic beliefs which reached their apex under the Nazis. Jews were then seen as fundamentally non-German, and incapable of being German. In that situation the Nazis felt that the Jews had to be removed from Germany, and it was in reaction to that goal that the mass murder of the Holocaust came about. \n\nThe growth of antisemitism in a European context was broad, and based upon a large backdrop of historical persecution. However, it was not consistent across all areas. The Dreyfus Affair alone shows that antisemitism was not a uniquely German phenomenon, but rather one that stretched across the entire continent. There was though variation, and the degree to which Jews were accepted as part of the civic, or national, body was dependent upon the specific states involved. Further, the distinction between religious and racial hatred was determined by location. Within Nazi Germany, hatred was based more upon racial ideology, while in some areas such as Catholic Hungary, it was more heavily influenced by religion. \n\nMany of the current stereotypes and tropes which are attributed to Jews today are developed from these contexts. From associations with taxation, and racialised conception of Jews as \u2018racial aliens\u2019 informing such tropes as the association with \u2018globalism\u2019, finance, Marxism, and economic exploitation. All were, and remain to this day, entirely hateful, prejudiced, and unfounded accusations. \n\nSo in short, Jews have been singled out for attack for centuries, for various reasons, based upon religion, nationalism, politics, and conspiracy theories.", "score": 24, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "date_year_month": "2019-04", "created_utc_converted": "2019-04-07 09:08:45", "score_overall": 6, "words": "libel jewish jewish conspiracy holocaust conspiracy", "shared_words": "libel jewish conspiracy holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}

{"author": "BipBopBoopBeDoo", "body": "Religion, especially Christianity, has had to dodge being put on trial.  Voltaire and Newton challenged the idea of a God who intervenes in the world.  Darwin found evidence in the fossil record to confirm those doubts and yet Christianity didn't crumple.  The ideals of the Church had gradually become the creed of respectable historians, scientists and politicians, part of a cheerful Victorian belief in the steady march of progress, and the church still occupied the moral high ground because it still laid claim to one truth - knowing right from wrong.  \n\nYet the Catholic Church felt threatened by academic challenges to the authority of the Bible, and its reaction was just to \nsay no.  Pope Pius X denounced what he saw as a conspiracy to overthrow church teaching and he branded it \nmodernism.  Catholics unfortunate enough to be seen as modernists found themselves treated as enemies of the faith. The \nviciousness of the official campaign against modernism cast a long shadow across much Catholic assessment of New Directions \nin doctrine the Catholic Church felt embattled and the twentieth century gave it plenty more reasons for that, for Pius X had missed the real far more terrifying modernism - the modernism of war.\n\nThe events of the 20th century upstaged the French Revolution and unforeseen horrors unfolded that transformed society, politics, and Christianity itself.  The murder of Archduke Franz Ferdinand dragged the empires of Europe into the first world war.  The experience of the great war began to undercut the one remaining unquestioned truth of Christianity - its claim to moral integrity.  Men who'd been there had seen horrors that their families back home simply couldn't imagine. \nHere is something interesting; A small book title Going to the front : The Soldier's Daily Remembrancer was issued by the Open Air Mission of London to all soldiers.  What it does is to try and associate Christianity and Jesus with the English \ncause.  Consider the following hymn :\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYield not to temptation for yielding is sin\n\nEach victory will help you some other to win \n\nFight manfully onward dark passions subdue \n\nLook ever to Jesus he'll carry you through \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt makes for chilling reading because Christians were urged on to kill other Christians, equally reassured that God was on their side.  Of course it was hardly the first time that God had been used as a divine recruiting officer, but it was the first global slaughter in his name. 37 million dead.  This world war had death on an industrial scale and not just death in the trenches, but many died in hospital slowly from their wounds. \n\nIn a wider sense, colonial troops were brought into a European bloodbath which had no concern for them and for many the moral credibility of Western Christianity was gone forever and in Europe a generation lost its ideals, lost its optimism, but Christianity was now confronted by a terrible challenge which threatened to destroy it entirely.\n\nIt also blinded many Christians to even worse moral temptation when the threat came from another child of the Enlightenment - scientific socialism.  In their Communist Manifesto Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote that freedom was only possible if religion was abolished.  It was in that scientific socialism when the Bolsheviks seized control of the Russian Revolution and bent it to their will.  They came to see the church as the enemy just as the French revolutionaries had once done.   \n\nMany Christians who feared the spread of communism were inclined to look sympathetically on any anti-communist group. \nEuropean Christianity was drawn into a fatal alignment with forces which had little time for the God of love.  First came the papacies deal with Benito Mussolini, finding a place for the church in his fascist Italy.  Then with Spain's General Franco, who could present himself as the champion of the Catholic Church as his Republican enemies burned churches and murdered priests.  However, neither of these links with right-wing power was as damaging as Christianity's entanglement with Adolf Hitler's gospel of hatred his project for an Aryan Future.  National Socialism became the defining evil of the century.  \n\nThe church had been hijacked by the Nazis for their own propaganda purposes.  To begin with Hitler wanted to bringtogether the Protestant state churches, nearly all Lutheran into a single National Church based on Nazi principles.  To get his way, German Christians purged Christianity of its Jewish roots more radically than any other Christian group in history.  They said that Jesus Christ could not have been a Jew.  Few versions of Christianity have openly scorned virtues like compassion or humility, but they did.  They actually called themselves the Stormtroopers of Jesus Christ.  \n\nThere was Christian collaboration with Nazism, but we should not forget there was Christian resistance too. It came from the papacy itself.  A pastoral letter by Pope Pius XI read from thousands of pulpits on Palm Sunday.  It denounced Hitler for betraying his assurances to the church and condemned the idea of a Christianity that tore up its Jewish roots. Yet there was little else done, and it was largely left to individual Christians in Germany to stand up against the Nazi regime.  However, by this point, contentious objection was not possible. \n\n\nWhile the world ripped itself apart, one of the greatest crimes against humanity was being carried out with ruthless  \nefficiency across Europe. It would leave the moral authority of the Christian Church yet further compromised and expose a deep hole in Christianity's historic relationship with the Jews.\n\nThe holocaust was a crime the Christian churches failed to resist.  It was offense against the Christian gospel, and an offense at a more profound Christian level because it offends against the fact that Christianity is a story about a person who is both human and divine, and concentration camps were designed to rob human beings of their personality to make them less than human. \n\n**It is not enough to say that the Nazis were anti-Christian, or non-religious**.  The Nazis were able to do their destructive work because they were so good at playing on  myth.  The myths which lurk in people's minds and this myth was that the Jews were the killers of Christ, the enemies of Christian civilization.  Many may disagree (or find the following conclusion offensive), but in that sense, Christianity is implicated in the murder of the Jews.\n\n\nChurch attendance actually increased in a frightened Europe, but that mood passed. The horrors of the first half of the the century had raised the old question Voltaire had posed in response to the Lisbon earthquake in Auschwitz 'where was  unloving God' Europe was sickened by any system which made absolute claims to truth.  Communism, Fascism, Christianity.  So it was hardly surprising that in the second half of the century an unprecedented almost frivolous mood confronted European \n\nChristianity - religious indifference, apathy, and social changes brought about a more relaxed attitude to sex and marriage.  Movement between social classes and more individual choice in the face of that fewer people chose to spend Sunday in church.  So what sort of Christianity could survive such an ebbing away of Christendom?", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "atheism", "date_year_month": "2019-04", "created_utc_converted": "2019-04-08 02:20:30", "score_overall": 5, "words": "conspiracy jewish jew jewish holocaust", "shared_words": "conspiracy jewish jew holocaust", "socre_distint": 4}

I would agree that they should have tried that, but would it have really been likely to work?\n\n*If you ask me if I would become part of a new secular,*\n\nI'm to understand Israel is about as secular as the Bible belt.\n\n*democratic,* \n\nIsrael's current Prime Minister just won his fifth term, despite the fact that he's currently battling corruption charges. Its politics have been drifting further and further right for a long time. I'm not saying it isn't a democracy, though five-terms-in-a-row is a red flag where that's concerned. I am saying that \"it's a democracy\" is not comforting when that democracy is mostly conservative.\n\n*muslimic state in Germany to save millions of Muslims from extinction*\n\nThe founding of Israel did not save millions of Jews from extinction. A second holocaust was a somewhat reasonable fear at the time, but it was not a certainty by any stretch. As evidence of this, I offer the fact that a second holocaust did not, in fact, happen, or, as far as I know, come close to happening. The founding of Israel also risked triggering such an event in the rest of the middle east, which was given by Jewish activists as an argument against founding Israel at the time.\n\n*Racism is the idea that people with a darker skin color are worse then whites in multiple categories, most importantly intelligence. Therefor racists think that it's OK to treat them like animals, exploit them, hit them, sell them, kill them. If someone kills your slave, they dameged your property. Antisemitism is almost the opposite concept: jews are more intelligent, they are greedy, they are evil, they control everything, they cause wars etc. Therefor they must be completely erased from existence.*\n\nPhilosophical comparisons between different bigotries are irrelevant. My point was that, since the holocaust, and indeed, counting the holocaust, gays and Jews have had it about as badly off as each other **in practice.** Being Jewish is not more dangerous than being gay. There is as much of an argument for Israel as there is for gayostan.\n\n*Antisemitism is the idiot's way of explaining the problems of mankind. There will always be idiots, and they will always come to the conclusion that someone is to blame, some individuals. And history shows that ultimately it always have been the jews who are declared responsible.*\n\nNazis  think Jews are the culprits of destruction, but they think racial minorities and, indeed, gays, are its tools. In practice, this leaves us no less exterminated than it leaves you. Admittedly, anti-Semites in the middle ages didn't link us together, but I'm not sure they believed in the fully formed version of the Jews-run-the-world conspiracy theory at all.\n\n*So when a leftist applys double standarts to israel, calls questionable characters peace activists or doesn't stand up against the comments that are in the Screenshot I originally posted here, he doesn't necessarily hate jews, but him delegitimizating Israel*\n\nIs there any way to argue against the founding of Israel without being a pewdiepie for antisemites?\n\n*and giving uncritical platforms to actual jew-haters puts the jews living there in a dangerous situation*\n\nWhere is there? If it's wherever the antisemite happens to be, I agree. If it's Israel, I don't think we need to worry about the alt-right taking root there. Maybe some far-left rhetoric is pro-Hamas enough to endanger individual Israeli civilians.\n\n*Also, there definitely are people who in fact do hate jews and apply that double Standart because it's a socially accepted way of expressing that hate, while normalizing it.*\n\nCertainly, though if their rhetoric is antisemitic, it will be somehow distinguishable from a reasonable criticism of Israel's behavior or existence (though it seems like you don't think a reasonable criticism of its existence is possible).", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "AntiSemitismInReddit", "date_year_month": "2019-04", "created_utc_converted": "2019-04-12 05:16:31", "score_overall": 8, "words": "holocaust holocaust jewish holocaust holocaust jewish conspiracy jew", "shared_words": "holocaust jewish conspiracy jew", "socre_distint": 4}

There are real counterarguments to many of your claims, but you are also regurgitating garbage nazi-esque talking points, and I fail to see why I can't call you out on that too.\n\n&gt; Hitler said in Mein Kampf\n\nThis is the kinda shit I'm talking about.\n\n&gt; that at first he liked the mainstream newspapers he read in Vienna, but he began to notice some very disturbing patterns in them which sparked him asking some questions too. \"Everything foreign is praised. Everything national and culture-preserving is hated.\" Is this not the world we're living in today?\n\nNo. No it's not, you are just using selective bias. Last I checked nobody wants to destroy american \"culture\" (in itself kinda a stupid concept because no single american culture exists). Unless you count wanting to take down confederate monuments and similar stuff as \"destroying culture\", at which point you need to ask yourself just what culture you are *actually* fighting to protect. \n\n&gt; We have a mainstream American paper heaping praises on foreign governments for committing the most heinous of rights violations against their citizens\n\nAre they? Is even the slightest constraints on speech now \"the most heinous of rights violations\"?

All you're really missing is to put triple parentheses around every use of \"globalist\" and you'd be set.

Not that she praised Hitler.\n\n&gt; the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), and the Zionist Organization of America. I can't make this up.\n\nThe list of people included facebook, google, Lawyer's committe for civil rights under law, Equal justice society, a number of other individuals such as Mohammad Abu-Salha whose family was killed in a hate crime.

You sound like a far right conspiracy theorist because you are just regurgitating far right conspiracy theories and talking points while doing almost no research yourself.\n\n&gt; This is real life, apparently. I feel like I'm going crazy...why is no one talking about this, why is no one concerned?\n\nWhen you feel like that, ask yourself \"if nobody else is concerned, which is more likely; that only I can see the issue, or that everyone else sees what's going on and understands there isn't actually an issue\"\n\n&gt; Unsurprisingly, these Jewish groups said that one of the biggest problems is how sites like Gab and 4chan \"serve as 24/7 White Nationalist\" Ookay....and what do you want the government to do about it, seeing as the government does not have the right to tell private sites what content they can host? \n\nSo you don't deny the accusations then? Because having been to both, I can most certainly confirm the accusations aren't false.\n\n&gt; Why is our Government, our Congress, hosting hearings for the stated purpose of helping social media companies collude to eliminate opinions they don't like?\n\nProbably because that's not what happened. Weird.\n\n&gt; I recently saw a picture of the director of the SPLC, too, in his office, with a chart showing the percentage of \"non-Hispanic white Americans\" by year - shown as 90% in 1920, falling to nearly 60% today, smiling next to it like a CEO tracking his profits as our people are eradicated by foreign interests. And this is the group that claims to be the leading authority on tracking \"hate groups.\"\n\n...oh so now we're bringing in white genocide claims too?\n\n&gt; and somehow people care what this degenerate organization has to say, \n\nThis is not helping your case of not looking like a nazi.\n\n&gt; and banks and Paypal shut off services to any group they identify as a \"hate group.\"\n\nLooking at their list of hate groups (nice quotation marks there), I see groups like the Aryan Brotherhood, Atomwaffen, and many others. Like... y'know, real hate groups. Fancy that.\n\n&gt; At no other time in history has society become so hateful, so intolerant towards anyone who wants to preserve their country,\n\nAh yes, hatred of hate is just as bad as the hate itself. No, AWD doesn't want to \"preserve the country\". In fact, basically no white supremacist group really wants that (although some use it as a cover for real ideals). Instead, they usually want either a white ethnostate, or in some cases genocide against non-whites. That's not something you support I really hope.\n\n&gt; And speaking of \"hate...\" this idea of \"Hate Speech\" is probably THE most evil, sinister, subversive idea that has entered the public discourse in the past two decades. \n\nYep. It's not the idea of \"white genocide\" or \"ZOG\" or anything like that, that pushes people towards extremism. It's hate speech.

{"author": "Poopee1", "body": "&gt; Is there a chance that you have been misled into thinking like this?\n\nOf course.  Deceit is everywhere and this includes history.  The history you've been told and now believe is definitely a bit lacking.\n\n&gt;The Russian Revolution had nothing to do with Jews, though.\n\nYou are factually incorrect here.  More than 90% of the bolsheviks were jews.  The party remained jewish despite their relatively tiny demographic.  Marx was a jew.  The leader of the Red Army was a Jew.  American Jews financed and aided them (as well as nascent communist movements in Germany).\n\n&gt; It was a populist movement fighting against the increasingly unequal society under the Tsar, ultimately to establish an egalitarian communist state that was fairer for the lower class in Russia during its darkest times. Not for Jews, for Russians.\n\nThat's the story.  Look at what happened, though.  Russians were starved and massacred in the tens of millions, a fate much worse than anything the tsars had ever done.  The number of political executions in pre-soviet russia was on the order of a few deaths over the course of a century.  The Russians lost big time in this deal, and Jews profited massively.  As above, communism is literally a jewish movement and the Russian Revolution had more to do with jews and Americans than with Russians themselves.\n\n&gt;In fact the Labour Party in the UK is very much on the left, with lots of sympathy for Communism, yet they're also infamously anti-semitic. That doesn't really play into your narrative at all, it kind of stinks it up.\n\nOh ho ho.  Maybe they are.  I doubt it.  The jews have gotten along quite well with the UK government for quite some time.  Ask yourself: what did the Balfour Declaration have to do with WWI?  What's the connection there?  (Hint: jews promised to get America pulled into WWI if Britain would give them Israel.  This allowed the Brits to decline the peace offered by Germany, turning WWI into a MUCH bloodier conflict, all so Jews could have Israel.)\n\n&gt;Every group has had their hand in world affairs, is that meant to be a bad thing? Because if so, there are a number of other groups who are responsible for far worse acts, carried out with a great deal of deceit. Do you hate Western Europeans for what they did to the Americas? It seems like you place an undue amount of emphasis on what you perceive to be terrible things carried out by the Jews, when actually it's not quite like that at all.\n\nYes.  Terrible things are done all the time in the names of many peoples.  The thing that bothers me so much about the jewish question is how much deceit is involved.  Judaism and islam are inherently deceitful worldviews, and though I won't go into the theology here it is relevant.  Tikkun Olam and all.  I actually suspect that the jews control many of the islamic blocs and encourage consanguineous breeding in order to keep their intelligence low and thus their potential for violence high, but I haven't studied this relationship yet, so it is merely a suspicion.\n\nThe deceitful nature of their ways is the awful part.  They don't use honest politics or wage honest war, they subvert.  You conveniently ignored my factual assertion that our \"news\" media and entertainment are nearly 100% controlled by jews.  This isn't a coincidence.\n\nThere are plenty of traitorous goyim who work along with the jews in the subversion and destruction of the west, so nobody's hands are clean.\n\nMy question to you, then, is: is it possible that you've been mislead?  There are factual inaccuracies in most of what you wrote above, but this is only known to people who dig a bit deeper than high school course or television documentary.  Antony C. Sutton was an academic who began to research these topics and, in return for his curiosity, was stripped of his prestigious appointments.  Really makes one wonder.  Another source of interesting information is the transcript of the Ernst Zundel trial.  He was prosecuted in Canada regarding his statements about the holocaust, and over the course of the trial, Jewish expert witnesses ended up admitting that their stories about the camps were false, that there was actually no physical evidence of \"Death Camps\", and that much of what they had passed off as factual was actually mere fiction.

It seems, if anything, that would put them in more danger, considering the tension between the two groups. That's not to even start on the whole breeding thing, how would that even work? Listen to yourself, life isn't a creepy horror mystery movie, these are a group of regular people trying to get along. Have you even met a Jew?\n\n&gt;our \"news\" media and entertainment are nearly 100% controlled by jews.\n\nIt's not, but even if they are, correlation does not equal causation. Also, these are not state sponsored programmes shoved down our throats. We're the customers, we decide what we like to consume so if something doesn't get enough ratings, it is cancelled. This is because the media are trying to give us what they think we want, because they rely on ad impressions. If we do not like it, their ratings drop and so do their profits because their ad spots become less valuable.

Howard Dickman does so here in his 1976 review of *Wall Street and FDR* in *The Business History Review.*\n\n&gt;*Wall Street and FDR* is a weak specimen of \"conspiracy history\" and one of its sub-genres, \"ruling class theory.\" It is poorly written and edited, digressive, repetitious, disorganized, and unconvincing. A vaguely identified Wall Street fox is the quarry: the hunt begins and ends by barking the magic names, Rockefeller, Morgan, and Du Pont, and the chase amounts to leaping over hedgerows of interlocking directorships to prove that every one is connected in some way to everyone else, and all are controlled by the great Wall Street banking houses.\n\nThe rest of your point here sounds made up.\n\n&gt;He was prosecuted in Canada regarding his statements about the holocaust, and over the course of the trial, Jewish expert witnesses ended up admitting that their stories about the camps were false, that there was actually no physical evidence of \"Death Camps\" \n\nIn his own words he was:\n\n&gt;persecuted but never prosecuted\n\nI tried looking for any evidence of his prosecution but could find absolutely nothing.

Gamarnik.\n\nBela Kun was also a Jew, and after failing his revolution in Hungary he became the head of the secret police in Russia.\n\nSolzhenitsyn writes of these topics in *The Gulag Archipelago* and *200 Years Together*.\n\nFor a quick list: http://heretical.com/miscellx/bolshies.html\n\n\n&gt;This kind of throws a spanner in your Jewish Communism conspiracy theory.\n\nThe existence of antisemitism proves that there is no Jewish conspiracy?  That does not follow.\n\n&gt;Really? Could you point to any of those, explain why I'm wrong and provide a source to support your claim?\n\nI did point them out.  The most glaring error is the idea that the bolshevik revolution was a Russian phenomenon.  The leadership was jewish, the commisars were jewish, the leader of the army was jewish, and so on.  The end result of that revolution was massive famine and suffering for the Russian people, and the creation of a war machine that was utilized by Zionist jews to help crush their enemies.  Russians lost everything and the Jews ended up with their holy land.  Cui bono?\n\n&gt;This man's work was brutally critiqued, not simply for an anti-semitic sentiment or from a discomforting reaction of harsh truths, but for simply being a poor academic.\n\nHe sure climbed pretty high for being a poor academic, no?  I've read a bit of his writing and it isn't terrible.  Everything is sourced in-line and the documents are pretty much all official correspondence that is archived with the respective governments.\n\nEverybody who questions the official narrative of the 20th century is harshly criticized as the current status quo depends upon it.  What else would you expect?\n\n&gt;In his own words he was:\n&gt;&gt;persecuted but never prosecuted\n\nHis point is that there was not actually a legitimate prosecution going on.  He was literally prosecuted, however.  There was a trial.  What's not to understand here?  Regarding the made up claim about the admission of fraudulent claims by jewish figures, I'll find a source for you.  Shouldn't be too hard for you to find if you dig into the trial a bit if you're really itching to learn.\n\n&gt;Also, the gas chambers in Auschwitz are still there. You can literally take a flight and see them. Travel a bit. The evidence for the holocaust is overwhelmingly mountainous\n\nI've studied in Munich, Stuttgart, and Paris.  The stereotype that all who question the official narrative of the 20th century are backwater hicks with no formal education or worldly experience is annoying.  \n\nI really don't see how walking about on a tour of some old buildings is supposed to convince me of anything.  Ditto for giant piles of shoes.  Disney World has tours of fantasy castles and cartoon characters walking around.\n\nDuring the Zundel trial an expert in human execution (he worked with various state authorities in order to oversee their capital punishment systems) testified that the \"gas chambers\" were almost certainly not gas chambers.  No seals of any sort around doors/windows, no ventilation system to remove the gas after the execution had occurred in order to allow guards to safely remove the bodies, no evidence of cyanide gas found on the surfaces of the room.\n\n&gt;overwhelmingly mountainous\n\nYet I can never find any.  The only thing I ever hear is \"it is overwhelming\".  There was a recent trial in the USA along these lines I believe.  The defendant offered $50,000 to anybody who could *prove* that gas chambers were used for killing people and a judge ordered him to pay some jew because the jew offered his own written statement as \"proof\".  Seems shady as hell, especially if the evidence is \"overwhelmingly mountainous\".  Why not just present a piece of brick from the room which shows signs of being regularly immersed in cyanide gas?  Why not provide some written orders to execute people in a gas chamber?  It should be the *easiest* thing in the world.\n\n&gt;such an elaborate lie\n\nIt isn't elaborate at all.  It is merely brutal.  Any questioning of the official story is met with outright hostility and hatred.  The ADL said some *nasty* stuff about Zundel during the trial... the jews said things more cruel than just about anything I hear on any regular basis.  A guy further up in the thread called me \"inhuman\" and claimed that I had \"less value than the dirt on his shoes\".  That sort of rhetoric is straight outta the talmud.\n\nOh, I forgot:\n\n&gt;It's not, but even if they are, correlation does not equal causation. Also, these are not state sponsored programmes shoved down our throats. We're the customers, we decide what we like to consume so if something doesn't get enough ratings, it is cancelled.\n\n\"It's not, but even if they are...\".  You claim it isn't true and then go on to defend against the truth of it.  It is true.  Regarding \"we decide what we like to consume\"--we do now, thanks to the net.  When the only \"news\" offered is controlled by the same group, there is no choice.  When the only entertainment offered is controlled by one group, there is no choice.  Jewish movie studio A or B?  Jewish television network A or B?  Do I get my info from Jeff Zucker or Mark Zuckerberg?  This can't be seriously doubted.\n\nDid you know that there is an organization called the Jewish Internet Defense Force (JIDF)?  Very suspicious.  Usually those who are in a permanent state of paranoia about being attacked by others are in a state of guilt.  I remember the feeling well--when, as a child, I had done something that I knew was wrong, I knew that I would probably be found out and thus became nervous 24/7.  The feeling isn't a fun one.  Was almost a relief to finally get grounded or accept whatever punishment was due.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk_KS0C_ZOA\n\n&gt;Brilliant, then can I see any of them?\n\nI'll spend the time to source a claim or claims of your choice if you'll spend the time to find the \"overwhelmingly mountainous\" evidence of the holocaust.

{"author": "send_nasty_stuff", "body": "Ok then.  Let me tell you about jews.\n\nThe first thing I always like to explain to people when dealing with JQ stuff is that this isn't some illuminati thing (although there are certainly people that go down that hole).\n\nThe jewish question is first and foremost favoritism, i.e. nepotism.\n\nIf you've ever heard of the 'good old boy' network that whites had in the south picture that same phenomena but a lot more intense and spread out over the entire globe.\n\nWhen jews do things (start a business, collaborate, etc) they always ask, 'is this good for the jews?' This is kinda hard for many non jews to understand because they might have aliegences to nation, god, family, community but would probably find it hard to make a local decision based on a small group of whites living in Japan or Luxembourg but jews through their history seem to have developed a tight tight survival bond despite being in constant diasporic positions.\n\nThe next thing to understand about jews is that they don't necessarily seek out positions of power or even positions of wealth; what they do seek out is what I like to call 'chokepoint' positions. A chokepoint position might not be the owner of an organization but the archivist or CFO or leader of an upcoming merger. A choke point position in a small western town might not be the dude that owns the cattle ranch but you and three of your jewish friends might sit on the board of the local credit union. You might not own a newspaper but you do write the dear abby column and on and on and on.\n\nChoke point positions can be developed into very very powerful and profitable positions over time and especially 'host cultural influencer' positions and if you think about it it makes sense right? If you're only 2% of the population it's in your best interest to make sure the people you live with don't develop nationalism or antisemitism. But jews have also always been at conflict with themselves because their 'actions' can cause host population resentment.\n\nI think jews more than any other race also see money not as something you spend to buy material goods and services but as a weapon to leverage people for more money and power. Lots and lots of people of all races struggle to see capital with this paradigm but it seems to come to jews naturally. Here's an interesting short article about this written in a very innocent way but helps illustrate the point.\n\nhttp://time.com/money/4959211/whitney-cummings-money-essay-im-fine/\n\nAnother preface to understanding the jewish people is that for thousands of years they've been a culture that highly values knowledge and education. Every culture seems to hold up a certain ubermensch 'form' that men strive for and women want to sleep with. In jewish culture that person was the person who could memorize the most lines of the Talmud or the highest accuracy of types of food pairings that were allowed under kosher law or the one who could 'out argue god' (that's actually a saying in judaism).\n\nNot only was education and brain power prized but also sophistry, wit, deception and ability act, embellish and to tell a story. Men like this became rock stars and mated with the highest quality women and produced the most offspring. Rabbi in judaism could marry. Jews also frequently went through periods in their diaspora where they weren't allowed or didn't prefer to mate with locals so there was some inbreeding. Jews today have some of the highest predispositions of schizophrenia (they can track their lineage with great accuracy back to 300 families! and modern genetics has confirmed these connections).\n\nI don't say all this to necessarily put down the jews. I think a lot of their biological development was simply a good adaptation to their conditions as traders the same way whites developed blue eyes for hunting in dark woods or western africans long legs for long treks for food.\n\nIf this adaptation stuff interests you here's a cool video on this.\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/youtube-3eV2Sc3pnBA\n\nNow how does this stuff circle around to jews being 'bad'? I really don't find all jews bad but I do believe they certainly have a very very well articulated ability to do some bad actions because they think they are protecting themselves and/or their tribe. They have an intensely heighten sense of victimhood. Jews in communist Russia were the first ones called on to do the dirty work of the commissars because they never had any moral failings. I think that's because they they rationalize doing it to protect their tribe. After Romans destroyed ancient Israel Jews rarely controlled large swaths of land or had access to firearms.  They adapted to this by latching on to the religious and/or political aristocracy of host nations and provided specialized skills. This was a perilous position if regime change came. Jews also have an elaborate imagination when it comes to how deeply their tribe is being harmed and how far they will go to get 'dirty' in protecting themselves and their tribe or people helping them. Jews that didn't have this intense loyalty to tribe were shoved into the folds of their host nations as a punishment. This excommunication caused a eugenic effect making jews more and more nepotistic and ethnocentric.\n\nAs history developed jews ran into 'gentiles' and gentiles had very different ways of looking at the world especially after they adopted christianity. In a way they were a lot more trusting. Jewish tricks and lies to make profit on their trading activities and lending activities often times were so devastating with trusting whites that jews ended up owning entire cities and regions of western europe and the UK. This is also knowns as 'Hawks amongst Doves.' As a result of this long standing power struggle Jews were kicked out of 109 countries 359 times. Now does that sound like persecution or maybe they weren't the best guests?  \n\nThis nepotism continues to this day.  Jews are 2% of the US pop yet vastly over represented in media, finance, academics, politics, etc. They are outstanding at raising money to promote and defend their political interests and don't see themselves as americans or europeans.  Just jews. This nepotism causes Jews to protect themselves even when their own members get in involved in revolution movements and cults.  Jews almost always side with their own if it's in their power too.  Jews codified how they promote and protect each other in the Talmud which has rules for how it's ok to harm outsiders under certain conditions and not ok to tell outsiders about business secrets or religious secrets.  This creates a community VERY good at subversion, revolution, and extracting wealth from non jewish groups. Jews really started to hit their stride in the industrial revolution as a result of these unique traits and skill sets. \n\nI'd love to go a lot deeper on this stuff especially the financial aspect and use of the theater and sexual perversion/addictive products but alas this comment is already WAY to long!\n\nOne more note is that jews are also VERY good at protecting their chokepoints, and financial positions once they've locked them down. They are excellent long term planners and strategist in this regard. They make excellent business men as referenced by many strong men in history.\n\nOk so that's just a brief brief intro on the jews. Here are some documentaries I'd recommend.\n\nJews in more modern western history and gentile cultural influence.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCkc-ZF_TSY\n\nJews getting kicked out of basically everywhere and examples of their modern nepotism.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljMPafQpfDU\n\nA longer more comprehensive look at jews from a catholic historians perspective\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygCE9Y28xWg\n\nA more conversational approach about the jewish religion itself and it's contrast with christianity.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIYw3JiN7o\n\nAnd here's an ashkenazi jew and a converted jews perspective on the 'hawks vs doves' strategy of jewish 'purposeful' diaspora\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_ORHyze5H0\n\nAnd here's a comment I wrote a few months ago that talks about jews and 'cultural marxism.' I've shared some similar sources in this thread but there are some other sources as well.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/DebateAltRight/comments/8jfaao/i_need_some_clarification_on_white_genocide/dyzei69/\n\nBe easy on yourself as you go down this rabbit hole. Use a critical eye. Space out absorbing the sources. Don't talk about it publicly as you're learning about it because people have been mentally programmed to have a knee jerk reaction to the slightest jewish critique and when you start to dig into the sources you'll see why that occurs and more accurately why it was 'installed.'\n\nHope that helps.

{"author": "fizikz3", "body": "**The President is creating a government shutdown crisis predicated on lies and racist rhetoric about illegal immigration.**\n\nAccording to the right wing think tank the CATO Institute, President Trump's administration has provided an incredibly misleading narrative about illegal immigration and crime.^[[1]](https://www.cato.org/blog/white-houses-misleading-error-ridden-narrative-immigrants-crime)\n\n&gt;But we should not tolerate the peddling of misleading statistics without context. What matters is how dangerous these subpopulations are relative to each other so the government can allocate resources to prevent the greatest number of murders possible. Thus, enforcing immigration law more harshly is an ineffective way to punish a population that is less likely to murder or commit crimes than native-born Americans. Illegal immigrants, non-citizens, and legal immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated, convicted, or arrested for crimes than native-born Americans are. \n\nThe Washington Post compiled statistical charts that indicate the Trump administration is lying when they claim illegal immigration is a crisis. They disprove Trump's lies including immigrants flooding the border (they're not), that they bring crime (they don't), and that they're a drain on the economy (they aren't).^[[2]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/21/theres-no-immigration-crisis-and-these-charts-prove-it/?utm_term=.5a93c2cb02fa)\n\n&gt;The administration has said that the country is in danger of being \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by \u201cmassive increases in illegal crossings\u201d that will bring \u201chorrible crime,\u201d \u201cunbelievably great taxpayer expense\u201d and the loss of American jobs.\n\n&gt;None of those claims are true.\n\n&gt;...Here's what we can say in conclusion. Current rates of illegal immigration remain extremely low by historic standards. Legal and undocumented immigrants are significantly less likely to commit most crimes than native-born citizens, making them a net benefit to public safety. The research shows that immigrants are not taking jobs away from U.S. natives, and their impact on wages appears to be small to nonexistent, particularly across the long term.\n\n**President Trump's rhetoric is incredibly dangerous and is reminiscent of authoritarian leaders who have committed crimes against humanity.**\n\nThe President's rhetoric - his referral to undocumented immigrants as *\"infesting\"* the United States is incredibly dangerous and it is not the first time he has alluded to white nationalist talking points.

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47147568](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47147568). Right now they've gotten to a much better place, anti-semitism dropped significantly over the course of decades following the Holocaust, and we've seen great advances in the ripping down of institutional racism, so they're no longer as oppressed as they were hundreds of years ago. But they're still commonly victimised and abused.\n\nRegarding their success, I explained this effect before.\n\n&gt;Jewish scholars were very meticulously studying their scriptures. As soon as secularism within the Jewish community began to take off, so did the number of successful Jews, and Jewish laureates. It has little to do with the fact they were Jewish, and more to do with their cultural insistence on study and also the founders effect.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That is, during the Holocaust especially, the Jews who could afford to do so, escaped. The majority who could not leave either perished or changed their identities.

Actually I think they get transferred to Jordan due to some agreement, but none the less they can get in to Israel easier than a fucking Jew would. Which is mind boggling and I have seen this myself while I was a refugee in Sweden.\n\nSource?\n\n&gt; Photos were linked and there is Fuhrer Directive 30 (http://lawcollections.library.cornell.edu/nuremberg/catalog/nur:00621) which is now also linked and was cited during the Nuremberg Trials thus Palestine was a legally recognized allied of the Nazi Party.\n\nBy your logic, then Israel is an ally with the US, which you declared a Christian fascist nation. By your logic, Israel was an ally of the Nazis since Jewish far-right leaders supported allying with Hitler against the British and hoping he would send Jews to Israel. \n\n&gt; Really now then please identify the other State that was established in Southern Palestine, of which all of Jerusalem was a part of, before Aug 20th 1920 as that is when the Articles of the treaty went into effect establishing the Jewish people as the sovereign over the region.\n\nThe treaty you keep referring to was only signed by the following states: France, Britain, Italy, Japan, Armenia, Belgium, Greece, Hejaz, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and the Ottoman Empire. The US didn\u2019t sign. Israel didn\u2019t sign in any form. The relevance of this treaty is highly questionable given the small number of states that recognize it and the superiority of subsequent, contradictory treaties that Israel freely signed. \n\nFurthermore, the treaty was violated in 1948 when 700,000 Arabs fled their homes and weren\u2019t allowed to return. \u201cit being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.\u201d The settlements prejudice those rights. The apartheid wall prejudices those rights. The denial of the right of return violates those rights.\u201d You have even though your argument through. \n\n&gt; Not at all, Palestine has no de jure on Jerusalem because it has never been their capital at any other point in history except currently when the Nazi Party and Adolf Hitler staked their claim on it in order to deny the Jewish people their home. There is absolutely no legal justification for their invasion other than to complete the goals of the Nazi Party as if they were rallying behind a shared Palestinian history then they would be aiming to retake their occupational capital of Antioch where Rome established them.\n\nIt was their capital during the British Mandate. \n\n&gt; Did they, because so far Israel has said they don't recognize Palestine and the didn't sign that partition plan it was forced upon us so.........\n\nWhen they signed the UN Charter, they agreed to follow UN laws, including previous decisions. If they liked the other treaty better, they didn\u2019t have to sign the UN Charter. No one forced them to sign it. \n\n&gt; It was uncalled for to call the Jewish people an occupation where ever they should congregate. \n\nI never did that. Just those living in the occupied territory. If it\u2019s so awful, you don\u2019t seem to have a problem with Netanyahu accepting a state visit from a nation who held that Palestine was under occupation as official policy. You\u2019re incredibly inconsistent. \n\n&gt;Remember prior to Israel we were an occupation of every nation we were in which was the whole reason the gentiles enacted the Holocaust to end that. Now we're the ones occupying the Nazis in our own homeland.\n\nThe Jews weren\u2019t occupying the US. Where do you get this shit from?\n\n&gt; The fact is that those who have no stake what so ever in the area and have enacted pogroms, an inquisition, a holocaust, and a number of other atrocities against the Jewish people have been deciding for decades what the Jewish people are allowed to do, where we can live, how many of us can live there, how we can protect ourselves, and so on. \n\nRight so what your saying is you want an exception to the UN rules that everyone else follows or is condemned and sanctioned if they refuse. Israel is a outlaw state. This was recognized as recently as 2016 when they were condemned for continuing the settlements despite repeated requests from almost every country in the world not to. The only explanation for your claims are a vast international conspiracy to team up against Israel, which isn\u2019t supported by the facts. \n\n&gt; No I need you to stop supporting the Nazi party and it's occupation of the homeland of the Jewish people. Your mohel would be ashamed to have snipped you I am sure if he knew you were advocating on behalf of the Nazi party.\n\nBy your logic, you support a Nazi Party in Likud, who allies with Kahanists, called the Jewish KKK by progressives around the world.

In England in the Middle Ages  Jews were the King's *property*. Leo Frank was *lynched* largely for being Jewish in the US in the early 1900s. Peter Stuyvesant (tried to) and General Grant did expel the Jews from certain parts of the US; Jonathan Sarna  and Leonard Dinnerstein have written about these incidents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think it is also important to understand more general history of Jews (apart from Antisemitism in isolation) because it can help to disrupt dangerous stereotypes. For example, a lot of people say Jews and Feminism don't mix...so the roles of Jewish women in Feminist movements is good topic to explore historically. Some recent  books-- Melissa Klapper's Ballots Babies and Banners of Peace-American Jewish Women's Activism 1890-1940 and Joyce Antler's Jewish Radical Feminism--these outline Jewish women's important roles in Feminism! The Jewish immigration experience in the US (again) is also a good starting point. Brodkin's How Jews Became White (because they were not always considered white!) is one good book on this topic. Jews played an important role in the Civil Rights movement too. Some died for the cause (search for the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner).

This is called the Diaspora.

The SCP Foundation, while being an interesting setting, is directly influenced by Antisemitic conspiracy culture. The first article, SCP-173 was written anonymously on /X/, which acts as a containment board for people currently experiencing mental breakdowns, Christian fundamentalist death cultists, and neonazis who are too crazy to fit in at /pol/.\n\nThe notion of a secret, global NGO that hides the truth about reality, manipulates and mindwipes the masses, and uses occult and paranormal practices, is a modern Antisemitic conspiracist's hot daydream. The Foundation around its inception took death row inmates for cruel experiments, expanding this to Refugee Populations in times of trouble, (since no one will miss them) and exterminated D class on a monthly basis. It's not hard to imagine that this monthly termination involves incinerating the corpses.\n\nThe SCP foundation is founded on and filled with antisemitic tropes, conspiracies, and even occasional blood libel. It portrays a docile world in the hands of their shadowy, paternal organization, culture and politics bending at the whim of the SCP foundation so they can shape the path mankind takes. They can manipulate the makeup of populations and nations, and rewrite history on a whim. It is a fascist's wet dream, both in the sense that they want it to be true so they can rebel against it, and in the sense that they want it to be true so they can be on the O5 council and wield that power.\n\nTo internet cretins, the SCP is a subversive mythology detailing the ways in which our society are dominated by \"the Jew\". If SCP were real, they'd be the ones hiding the truth of flat earth. They'd be the ones running the \"deep state\". They'd be hiding the secret class of lizard peope. If the SCP Foundation were real, they'd be the ones who faked the holocaust.\n\nIf you are at all familiar with the modern conspiracy landscape for neonazis, then you already know everything you need to know about the SCP foundation.\n\nIf you know what \"cultural marxism\" means, then you already know why the SCP wiki including a rainbow flag or accepting a wider variety of stories was such a big trigger for bigots. From their perspective, the SCP foundation is much closer to reality than you'd believe. From their persepctive, they tapped into a truth about the world, and the fact that it got popular is a sign that everyone can see that truth shining through. (\"Everyone totally agrees with me that there's a secret Jew-like menace; they just haven't been taught how to identify 'the enemy' yet.\")\n\nBUT the Jewish conspiracy cannot rest while anonymous people write stories online. The more popular the SCP wiki got, the more stories started to exist that do not support the narrative, and the more people read the wiki who totally miss the despicable inspiration for the SCP canon, eventually almost totally separating SCP from its origin. And then SCP hit what some consider the mainstream. And the inclusion of a rainbow flag as the logo is like the equivalent of the soviet flag rising over Berlin. It is a sign to all the bigots that the SJews have ruined yet another piece of innocent fun with their directed moral degeneracy lasers.\n\nOf course, if you're a normal person, you'll see the SCP Foundation for what it is; a fun, collaborative writing project set in a tense Sci-Fi conspiracy world. There are no nazis; aside from maybe Hitlers brain in a jar. These normal people write stories that reflect their lived experiences, and that is enough to cause a major meltdown in the cryptofascist part of the website. So much of a meltdown that they conclude SCP has been infiltrated (by who?), is a lost cause, and that they should make their own SCP with blackjack and hookers. Except the dunces forgot that there's literally no canon. None of the stories or changes they hate matter because they are just being done by some amateur volunteer writers on the internet.

I don't appear Jewish in anyway, so these people didn't know I was, but somehow an old lady in a laundromat guessed I was Jewish, and was generally very nice and going on about how many Jews have done well in the UK.

Do you think we are Jews? We can;t afford that.\"  They turned bright red when I told them me and one of my friends were Jews.\n\nNone of these were awful, but it just struck me as odd (and very unpleasant) to hear so many comments, and apparently Jews take up a lot of mental space in British minds.  This was about 20 years ago.\n\nThree years ago I was at a wedding in Ireland for one of my English friends, and there was a Jewish guy who lived in the UK.  He had a million questions about being Jewish in the US, and seemed pretty concerned about the situation in the UK.  So perhaps it has gotten worse.  We see what has been happening with the Labour party for example.\n\nThe incident that was the worst was with the Swiss guy in NYC.  Just the matter of fact way he was stating how Jews are so arrogant and terrible was stunning to me.  It was some deep-seated hate in the old German tradition.\n\nBut besides anecdotes, anti-antisemitism is a deep rooted part of Christian European history, and the European psyche. It's a very part iof the European DNA.  After being persecuted by the Romans, the Christians wrote the gospels in a way that changed the primary enemy of Christ from the Romans to the Jews.  As Christianity became pro-Roman, it then became a supporter of its successor states.  \"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's.\" \n\nSo Jews became a useful scapegoat to both the state, and the church, and festivals like the one in Poland that this post is about became a thing.\n\nJust as importantly, there were legal restrictions and statuses for Jews in Europe, much like there were legal distinctions between royalty/commoners, and strict class distinctions.\n\nIn the US, none of this really applied.  There was no state religion to collude with the state, and there was a diversity of different denominations (and cults, and utopians) to further dilute any concerted effort at anti-semitism.\n\nLikewise, Jews has no different legal status under the constitution than any other free person.  I think a great example of this is the letter from George Washington to the Synagogue of Newport https://www.tourosynagogue.org/history-learning/tsf-intro-menu/slom-scholarship/86-washington-letter.  He's basically saying you are American citizens, no different than any other.  Not bad for 1790.\n\nNow of course, I said free citizens, and under the constitution, slaves were 3/5 of a person, and I'd argue that black people are the Jews on the US.  An \"other\" element, always blamed for making all kinds of problems.\n\nAnother difference is that Americans are more accepting of inequality than Europeans, and American Jews have been quite successful.  But instead of that causing widespread envy and hate, it has led to admiration.  Jews are looked at as industrious people who have found success.  Likewise, East Asian people here are viewed in very much the same manner, and are very admired.  Many Indian people too. (Interestingly Jews, Asians and Indians are often found living together in towns with the best schools, because education is paramount to their cultures). \n\nNow, it isn't perfect here, but the vast majority of wrongs to Jews were social exclusions like not being able to join certain clubs, or go to elite colleges, and of course there were exclusions from certain fields of employment.  The worst action was turning away Jewish refugees in the 30s.\n\nAs for today, we had a synagogue shot up by a Nazi, so again, it's not perfect.  But hate towards Jews gets rolled up into right wing hate that is against anyone who isn't white, instead of being the only target.  And that is a major problem in the US today, but that isn't only for Jews.\n\nLong story short, we don't have thousands of years of church and state directed anti-semitism here, and Jews have been full American citizens from day 1. I think you would be very, very hard pressed to find any American Jews that would prefer to live in Europe.\n\nHope you were able to get through that wall of text.", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "worldnews", "date_year_month": "2019-04", "created_utc_converted": "2019-04-23 13:49:34", "score_overall": 9, "words": "holocaust jewish jew jewish jewish jewish jewish scapegoat jewish", "shared_words": "holocaust jewish jew scapegoat", "socre_distint": 4}

Prisoners of war are soldiers, not civilian families. Whatever, i explained above. Do you know how to read? Not all inmates were Jews. But yes, ultimately the goal was to kill all the Jews. But until that was done, they wanted to keep the labor force (including Jews) functioning, which included some services and amenities that they had varying degrees of access to. Pure death camps like Treblinka had none of this, this is why your memes don't talk about them\n\n&gt;The Axis powers struggled to fund their war effort. If they are frothing at the mouths to kill all Jews, why did they spend funds to give them humane living conditions prior to massive gassing efforts?\n\nif you went into a camp with 6 massive furnaces to keep up with the dead bodies, do you think living conditions would be acceptable? Best Western level, at least? oh yeah, muh typhus. muh supply lines. And your frothing at the mouth shit is your own theatrics. It was very deliberate and organized. 90% of the Jews gassed failed selection when getting off the train and weren't even registered into the camp. \n\n&gt;They didn't want to start a panic? Why? What are a bunch of poor defenseless Jews going to do against the whole armed German army? Are you insinuating a bunch of armless starving jews could overwhelm the domestic armed german forces? \n\nMaybe. Uprisings did occur, like in Warsaw. Why make things harder for yourself? Feeding them a line about them being resettled somewhere so they peacefully get on the train and get shipped to a death camp and not realize they're fucked until the last minute is a lot less messy then shooting them in the streets or outside of town where their bodies would be discovered. There was also an optics issue - the Germans made a big propaganda deal out of Katyn and didn't want the same done to them. This is the weakest most pointless argument\n\n&gt;There's no reports that talk about mass gassing of Jews.\n\nbut there's reports about [gas vans](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2015/10/contemporary-german-documents-on.html)\n\n&gt;*\"ninety-seven thousand have been processed using three vans\", \"to facilitate the rapid distribution of CO\" and \"when the back door is closed and it gets dark inside, the load pushes hard against the door\".*\n\nThere's also their reports about mass shootings by the [Einzatsgruppen that i linked before](http://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/document/DocJager.htm). No mincing words, just describing how many Jews were shot location by location. So logic dictates that gas chambers happened too and whatever reports they were destroyed, there's no law of physics saying that Nazis aren't allowed to destroy evidence, they did it all the time. Unless you want to play the game of calling whatever document you don't like fake, in which case why demand to see reports in the first place? \n\n&gt;There's no bones. No mass graves. No records of these millions of Jews.\n\n[Here](https://yahadmap.org/#map/) .. [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be%C5%82%C5%BCec_extermination_camp#Archeological_studies).

Records of how many before the war, records after. Records of how many were shipped to these camps. So where did they go?\n\n&gt;To top it all off, there' a massive amount of countries that ban even questioning any of this. Not any other \"atrocity\" throughout history. Not other genocides. Just this one. Wake the fuck up. \n\nis illegal to deny bolshevik crimes in certain countries. its illegal to deny the Armenian genocide in armenia at least. this is a shit argument. no shit they politicized it, they didn't want it happening again, but it doesn't mean it didnt actually happen. this shouldn't be your smoking gun if your IQ is over 88 \n\n&gt;While I'm talking about concentration camps in nazi germany you're going off on some wild tangent about the USSR having firing squads. We're not talking about USSR that betrayed nazi germany. \n\nare you retarded? I'm talking about the Einsatzgruppen that I mentioned before, not the Soviets, do you even know who they are? please tell me I'm not debating the holocaust with someone who doesn't know what EG were. They were the killing units that followed the advance of the Wehrmacht and cleared areas behind the line. In the USSR they usually didn't put Jews in camps in there, they took them out villages, made them dig their own graves, and shot them in the woods. Gassing was the solution for the millions of Jews already in Nazi captivity in the Reich, Poland, Hungary, etc up until 1942. \n\n&gt;The meme isn't about only only German guards that couldn't be fed. The entire axis army couldn't be fed by the end of the war.\n\n[do these guards look like they were starving to you?](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/04/22/20/27DDE8C600000578-3051101-image-m-1_1429730584858.jpg) . This is horse shit, bro. Its a calculated tactic to say it was basically the Allies fault for these inmates dying because muh supply lines (are you an expert on German logistics during ww2? didn't think so). They starved and died of diseases, yes. They were also gassed and shot. If Germans died of poor conditions in Soviet camps you wouldn't blame the Germans for 'destroying the supply lines'. I'm not retarded, I know what you're doing. \n\n&gt;Lots of people have been caught in this hoax. \n\nStories that have been disproven don't change the fundamental narrative the Holocaust. Historians gather multiple sources of information to establish this narrative.  Ellie Wiesel won't change this. Again, you're sabotaging your own conspiracy theory. Either there's a perfect hive - mind style hoax where millions of people cooperate and keep silent, or people make shit up to sell a book. Choose one. Tell me one person ACTUALLY caught in this hoax, meaning actually involved in this massive conspiracy. Show me one German who said some Jew visited him and told him to incriminate his country in this war crime, or else. You won't find one. Its fucking impossible, do you understand? The only people that disputed the Holocaust were people who were never actually there. \n\n&gt;Jews got Israel off this bullshit so they stood to gain a lot.\n\nI love this one. Presumably the British were also involved in this hoax, same as the Americans, the Nazis, the Soviets, all held together by Jewish mind control. But the Zionists still had to bomb and kill British soldiers to make them pull out of Palestine. What, they didn't get the memo? lol\n\nHere's the big picture: \n\nMillions of Jews went into the death camps in question. Even if you want to pretend there were no gas chambers, logically the attrition rate from muh supply lines would have to be in the same 70-90% rate as if they were actually getting gassed, which they were. In 1944, 400k Jews were [deported to Auschwitz from Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Hungary#Deportation_to_Auschwitz) in a few months\n\n&gt;*By July 9, 437,402 Jews had been deported, according to Reich plenipotentiary in Hungary Edmund Veesenmayer's official German reports.[70] One hundred and forty-seven trains were sent to Auschwitz, where 75% of the people were exterminated on arrival.[71]  It has been estimated that one third of the murdered victims at Auschwitz were Hungarian.[72] For most of this time period, 12,000 Jews were delivered to Auschwitz in a typical day*\n\nThe maximum population of Auschwitz was 100k even if you included all the satellite camps. This means either they were killed on arrival or something else happened to them, because logically they couldn't intern these huge amounts of people in such a short amount of time. So where did they go? **Holocaust deniers don't have their own theories**.

{"author": "ShowMeUrChungus", "body": "Hey, read through your entire post, so please return that courtesy to me if you don't mind. The first part might be a little triggering, but it doesn't come from an aggressive place. I respect you for laying your thoughts out, I enjoy having debates.\n\nThis part is pretty unrelated, but give it a go. Figured I would lay it bare straight off the bat instead of letting this bleed through midway. \n\nI am a Jew, grandparents immigrated to Skokie, a suburb that became home for thousands fleeing the Benelux region from ACTUAL Nazis. Every generation in my town carries the weight of the holocaust on their shoulders, to some degree. The trend of conflating attention seekers, trolls and edgelords to the Third Reich has become really popular in the last 5 years or so. Practicing Jews, and most people with Jewish identity tend to view this as spineless, slimy, and self congratulatory. You'd be wise to respect the gravity of that subject, and it's also worth noting that our community is largely conservative. We have been taught to cherish our freedom of speech. The central theme of Judaism is perseverance in the face of endless subjugation, we do not need unaffiliated white knights to go to bat for us. It's also ironic that leftists bang the Nazi drum and question the sovereignty of our only homeland in the same breath. You can't have it both ways. That's the last I'll speak of the subject.\n\nAnyways, we're talking about a lyric that was lost in translation, a lyric that a glorified blogger at Kotaku deemed to be \"ableist.\" Not racist. Let's go paragraph by paragraph.\n\n1.) Disproportionate compared to what subculture, statistically speaking? That's a bold claim. You should elaborate.\n\n2.) Jeremy was banned after being assaulted outside of GenCon. The organizers of GenCon victim blamed Jeremy for the occurrence and stated that his ban was due to \"harassment,\" which gained a lot of criticism, because the harassment was never substantiated, but the assault was a brazen crime. So that would make you a victim blamer. \n\n3.) Again, kind of exposes the flaw in the argument that you've both presented. This thread is addressing a comment that is, by the consensus of this thread, a misconstrued and falsely identified slur towards the autistic community. One sentence I wrote spurred four paragraphs with the same content. You've also managed to conflate the wide umbrella of harassment with organized hate groups. Does this change the purpose that gaming was designed to fill? No. Do you have any ideas in mind to address this issue? No. Of course not. All of the pieces are in place. There is nothing left to censor for the regressive hivemind. Your best bet at this point is passing a bill that recognizes getting called a slur in an online game as a felony. The liberal outrage mob has exhausted the private sector's censorious reach, the only way to top yourselves is by going to your local congressman. I have a feeling that even you know your side's censorship fetish has gotten embarrassing, so perhaps you're being coy. I thought I'd do the honors for you.\n\nNazis or racists can congregate via any means, whether it be a sport, a religion, a workplace, a watering hole. Or an online medium. Shrieking about a demographic, in a setting that GREATLY monitors this type of behavior, is useless. You echo the sentiment that online gaming is the preeminent recruiting ground for extremism. Substantiate that. This is very generalized rhetoric arguing that more needs to be done about this issue. So you should definitely throw some statistics my way. You are surmising some pretty eyebrow raising claims.\n\n4.) No, I did not. As far as the popular vote is concerned. As of 2003 there are an estimated 25,000 white supremacists in the US. As of last year, the KKK estimates they have between 5000-8000 members, and at their peak had 4 million members nearly a century ago. The white supremacist movement has reached it's nadir. \n\nSince you aren't really providing a statistical backing to prove that this is an epidemic, and why this perceived scourge is exclusive to right wing extremists (I take it you're referring to the white demographic) let me end by unpacking the last point you made.  \"how can people use them as such when they're often subject to real life racism and sexism from other gamers?\" That is not real life, there are privacy settings to prohibit people from engaging with you for online games, and a majority of games are single player and/or don't feature online modes. It is impossible for online comments to prevent gaming from being fun in that sense.  I take it you don't play video games, given the subreddit we're in. My apologies for seeming condescending if you do.\n\nLet's not forget that I was originally responding to a justification for borderline libelous journalism, if not outright libel. The justification was a pivot to Nazism in the gaming community. You dedicate one sentence begrudgingly acknowledging this, and then\nlay out four paragraphs talking ad nauseum about how racist people play video games. Everybody plays video games. There are about 25,000 white supremacists in the United States. When people clown on you for complaining about racism in video games, they do it because it is often sensationalized, pseudo philosophical, conflated with actual extremism, and is almost never paired with an actual suggestion for fixing it. \"the toxic elements of gaming are a lot worse than you think.\" Well, I like facts and numbers. Telling people that racism exists does not make you Noam Chomsky. That's not profound at all, there are no case studies provided, you've got no solution in mind. Anecdotes, stating that racist people play games, does not forward the conversation. It is regressive. Gang affiliates, cartel members, rapists, and terrorists also play video games.

When are you going to figure out that if a conspiracy theory requires you to call every piece of evidence you don't like fake, its probably bullshit? \n\n&gt;Nice picture, when was it taken? Before the war, early or late? If you're arguing that the german army was well fed before surrender that's one of the dumbest 'losing' battles you can take. Unlike the holocaust there's actual records of the german army deteriorating due to lack of supplies which included food provisions. German commands actually talked about this unlike the fake story about mass killing all Jews. \n\nit was taken right after the liberation of Belsen. Those women look pretty well fed to me, [unlike their prisoners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen-Belsen_concentration_camp#/media/File:Mass_Grave_3_at_Bergen-Belsen_concentration_camp.jpg). I'm not denying that the German army had supply problems but your whole angle here is a bullshit tactic that you were taught to repeat. Intentionally putting people in conditions where they will die is still genocide. When Stalin took away the Ukranians grain cause it was needed elsewhere, knowing they would starve, and gave orders to shoot anyone that left the famine affected areas, whats the difference between that and a fucking concentration camp? But you call the Holodomor a genocide, not an accident, because you have a double standard and a narrative to push\n\n&gt;There's an overwhelming lot of stories that have been proven wrong about the holocaust. Does this not make you rethink everything regarding it? Why do you propose so many liars have spawned from the holocaust? Why has there been so much revision? Why is it so illegal to just get to the bottom of everything. Remember it was once common fact that the lampshades and rollercoasters were real. The #s don't make sense. FUCKING WOODEN DOORS. \n\nIt's not overwhelming stories, though, is it? That's why you guys just have 3-4 memes to bring up, which sound funny to kids but don't disprove an entire genocide, any more than 1 rumor or false account would cause all the other evidence for any other massacre to be thrown in the garbage if we were talking about any other historical event. The holocoaster story is a rumor mentioned in one (1) book and they don't even source it as coming from a Jew. The masturbation machine story was made up by an Australian non-jew who wrote a fake book a few years ago. None of this shit was ever taken serious by historians who require facts to be verified. Doesn't this make **you** rethink everything, that these clowns are relying on a couple of meme stories no one ever heard of to prove the entire holocaust was a hoax? and then lie about wooden doors or the red cross etc? Maybe you're the one getting tooled here. [Here](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2017/11/nazi-shrunken-heads-human-skin.html#humanskinlampshades) is where the lamp shade rumor came from if you're interested btw \n\n&gt;muh Rothschilds\n\nokay? thats not what I said. why are you going off on tangents like every other tin foiler? You claim they faked the holocaust to get Israel, and take for granted that all the other major powers including the British were complicit in this hoax, unavoidably. But the Zionist terrorist groups in Palestine still had to fight a violent insurgency against the British to get Israel in 1947, and the Soviets supported the Arabs against the Israelis throughout the cold war. None of this shit makes any sense. and ww2 didn't start because of 'zionist bankers', it started when Hitler started conquering Europe to get more land for Germany. Its really obvious that you've had your basic big-picture knowledge of ww2 that we learn in middle school replaced by propaganda. \n\n&gt;Oh Holocaust deniers don't have their own theories. Pro Holocaust people simply change the narrative every time their old one gets BTFO out. They had to make major changes once the internet became big. Holocaust deniers don't have their own theories...... that's rich coming from a group that has to keep molding theirs and creating laws and school propaganda to keep the lie alive.\n\nlol you just avoid what I said? once again\n\n1. How did nearly half a million Hungarian Jews get sent to Auschwitz and just disappear? How did the entire Jewish population of millions of Jews in Poland and other Eastern European countries get a similar treatment and vanish? If holocaust deniers insist that they weren't killed, then what do they think happened to them instead, and what evidence to they present (real evidence, not jokes about holocoasters etc). \n\n2. the official narrative isn't getting BTFO'd. the conspiracy narratives are being BTFO'd. nearly every argument the denier crowd presents turns out to be some kind of lie or misrepresentation, i've seen most of them, and most people are usually too embarrassed by now to bring up the low-IQ memes that you have itt . their case gets weaker the more you look into it, not stronger.  you're the one that's been lied to, sorry", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "ChapoTrapHouse", "date_year_month": "2019-04", "created_utc_converted": "2019-04-24 14:55:32", "score_overall": 17, "words": "holocaust jewish holocaust conspiracy holocaust holocaust holocaust jew jew holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust holocaust jewish holocaust conspiracy", "shared_words": "holocaust jewish conspiracy jew", "socre_distint": 4}

Gerald Kaufman [the late Labour MP], who died last year, used to say the very same thing, which is why I always respected him.\u201d\n\nMs Braithwaite, who describes herself as a \u201cstrong\u201d supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, has also promoted myriad conspiracy theories.\n\nIn May 2016, she circulated an article which claimed German police officers had marched against a \u201cRothschild European Central Bank\u201d.\n\nIt went on to claim the Rothschild family had been \u201cresponsible for almost every war on earth\u201d, and were not \u201cJewish\u201d but rather \u201csatanist\u201d and \u201cthe Illuminati\u201d.\n\nAnother shared by her in April that year purported to show evidence suggesting the Nazis co-operated with Zionists during the 1930s. It contained an image of a gold coin, emblazoned with the Star of David on one face and a swastika on the other.\n\nShe has criticised the internationally recognised definition of anti-Jewish hatred, and during the height of the Labour\u2019s anti-Semitism row last summer shared an article suggesting \u201cIsrael\u2019s hand\u201d was behind it.\n\nTwo days later, she shared another article accusing Luciana Berger, a prominent Jewish MP who recently quit Labour over anti-Semitism, of whipping up false allegations against Mr Corbyn.\n\nThe article went on to claim Ms Berger had requested a bodyguard at Labour\u2019s annual conference in Liverpool, adding: \u201cYou reap what you sow, I suppose\u201d.\n\nIn fact, Ms Berger was afforded police protection after receiving death threats and a torrent of racist abuse.\n\nEuan Philipps, a spokesman for the campaign group Labour Against anti-Semitism said: \u201cIt is unthinkable that someone who apparently holds such views, as these posts suggest, might be elected to a role of public office.\"\n\nIt comes a week after Labour suspended three council candidates for spreading anti-Semitic conspiracy theories online. \n\nIn a statement passed to this newspaper, Ms Braithwaite said: \"As a black socialist woman, I have been opposed to all forms of racism and discrimination throughout my life.\n\n\"These are old posts, which I did not write but shared on social media, before I knew about these antisemitic conspiracy theories, and I would not share them today.\n\n\u201cI am sincerely sorry for the offence I have caused. I am committed to fighting antisemitism, which is so worryingly on the rise across Europe.\u201d\n\nA Labour spokesman said: \"The Labour Party takes all complaints of antisemitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms. All complaints about antisemitism are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken. We can\u2019t comment on individual cases.\n\n\u201cIndividuals who are suspended from the Party can\u2019t stand as Party candidates.

{"author": "AppropriateOkra", "body": "I am american but I spend a lot of time learning about this conflict so I'll share my input:\n\n&gt;what is the reason behind creating a Jewish state, is it to do with going back to the promise land?\n\nTo finally have a place where Jews are not subject to the whims of anyone else after a thousand years (literally) of discrimination in Europe and even more years of discrimination in the Middle East.  Theodore Herzl, the \"father\" of modern Zionism, did not create a religious movement.  I don't even think he was observant though maybe he observed the big holidays?  It just so happened that the Ottoman Empire folded around the time that this movement gained steam and Israel was a logical place to re-form the homeland.\n\nAs you said, Zionism has been around a lot longer.  Jews were constantly oppressed in Europe (where modern Zionism started).  They often couldn't own land, had very restricted professions, had to live in specific parts of the country, and it wasn't uncommon at all for a ruler to kick the Jews out, steal their wealth, and then eventually let them back in without returning their possessions.  There were often pogroms (anti-Jewish mob massacres) and the Jews were used as scapegoats commonly.  Bad economy?  Blame the Jews, obviously it's their fault.  Blood libel was common just as it has been in the Middle East (like that Jews use the blood from Christian children to make Matzoh \ud83d\ude44) or Jews poison Christian wells out of their pure evilness, Jews shape shift and kill people with their Jew magic, etc.  Even before the Holocaust the Jews were sick of this, obviously, and that's why Zionism took form.  It wasn't the first time it was just the last time.  Maybe you're familiar with the Protocols of the Elders of Zion?  It's a book that the Russian secret police forged 120+ years ago from the perspective of a secret Jewish cabal intent on controlling the world. Although Europe all but stopped spreading it outside of white nationalist circles it's been wildly popular in the Middle East even today.  Henry Ford (American car manufacturer) even had a ton of copies printed and distributed when he was alive, until he realized it was proven a forgery and then he stopped printing it.  If you want to know more just google Europe's history of anti-semitism spanning the second millennia.\n\n&gt;Some of my Jewish friend oppose the idea of a Jewish state located in Israel and say the promised land was not intended to be reclaimed but supposedly was to be given by some messiah. Is there truth to this?\n\nYes but mostly ultra-religious Jews believe this.  According to Jewish teaching, God basically said the Jews would lose their homeland until God sent a messiah and returned the land.  Secular Jews don't care because they'd rather be alive and not persecuted than dead and content they didn't go against God.  Most Jews are not claiming divine right to live there right now.  It's something Israeli critics like to claim so they can easily say \"your holy book doesn't give you the right!!\"\n\n&gt;Does the inclusion of anti Israel comments in this definition, really anti semitic or a means to stop criticism of Israel? My university union had a committee vote on this and it was rejected due to stopping political speech.\n\nI don't know exactly what you mean but I see this on wikipedia:\n\n&gt;&gt;and attempts to apply a double standard to the State of Israel.\n\nHere's the thing.  Some people will wrongly claim anti-semitism when Israel is criticized.  Some poeple will see it when others don't, both sides having a point.  Sometimes anti-semitic sentiment is cloaked in anti-Israel or anti-zionist language.  I can share several examples if you want, just ask.  As far as double standards go, it's usually not explicitly stated by the speaker why they're applying the double standard so a lot of Jews or Israelis will feel like the only difference, Jewishness, is the reason for a double standard since all else is equal.  For example, when people criticize Israel for being an \"ethnostate\" but will virtually never criticize any other state for it, you have to wonder if it's anti-semitism.  A perfect example is palestine.  It's 99% Arab Muslim and has laws that say it's for Arab Muslims and only Arab Muslims will rule palestine.  Yet you will virtually never see those same people shouting about Israel (which is \"only\" 75% Jewish with a large mixture of Jews from many different backgrounds) call palestine an ethnostate.  In fact they support palestine, a *much* stronger ethnostate.  Why?  Because they're anti-semitic?  IDK but I do know if you give Muslims a pass to have 26 officially Islamic countries and deny Jews their own country, anti-semitism is high on the list of reasons and guesses as to why and in effect, it's an anti-semitic stance to take.\n\n&gt;What do you guys, Israelis/Palestinians, want to happen? Tbh I dont really mind a fully Israel state due to a number of reasons, there is less corruption more civilised and humane in general compared to the Palestinian regime. \n\nMost Israelis want a 2 state solution for obvious reasons.  Would you trust \"palestinians\" to never again try to take action against the Jews?  You can't.  No, I'm not saying all palestinians are bad.  I'm just speaking as a whole, they can't be trusted to completely renounce all expressed desire to have a purely palestinian state \"from the river to the sea\" without Jews.  It would be suicide to have a single state.  Some Israelis don't want a palestinian state but that's a much less common opinion.\n\n&gt;I would ideally like the fighting to stop and move towards a more multi cultural society.\n\nI'd like free perpetual energy and a time machine but it's not going to happen.  I always support working toward peace though.\n\n&gt;This information really shocked me, the media in the west vastly reports on how the Israelis are the agitators and attack the Palestinians but after digging through articles I found it to be the opposite. Israel attacks back not to harm the Palestinians but to stop radicalised individuals from killing more people. I know you cant blame all Jews or all muslims for one persons actions but my God has the media portrayed the conflict in a one sided way.\n\nMost media outlets are left leaning and the left has taken on this narrative.  They hate Israel and only see palestinians as underdogs.  They are blind to anything but seeing them as victims of the evil white people even though more Israelis Jews have middle eastern backgrounds than not.  They only know Jews as white Europeans.\n\nYou said elsewhere you were downvoted for sharing your identity.  I don't think so.  Non Israelis and Muslims post here every now and then and when they're polite and kind they are received the same way from what I've seen.  I think you may have initially been downoted for how you started your comment which is basically like a, no offense (really), delusional hippy.  Yes we all want everyone to stop fighting and to live in peace but that's not close to reality.  Right now Hamas is trying to tunnel into Israel to launch an attack.  They last sent rockets into Israel maybe a month ago?  I think also sometimes Israelis/this sub get very worn out by talking about this to new people, especially when they have that view yet the PLO is currently rejecting money from Israel in protest because Israel is withholding the equivalent of every dollar they pay terrorists for attacking Israelis through their \"martyr fund\".  Yes, any Palestinian arrested by Israel or killed for ANY reason whatsoever is eligible for an ongoing paycheck from the PLO.  Arrested for trying to stab a random Israeli man walking home from the store?  Paycheck.  Shot to death for carrying out a drive-by shooting?  Your family gets a paycheck.  If this was your \"peace partner\", and the *less* radical of the two (the other being Hamas) would you want to hear about \"I want the fighting to stop \u270c\ufe0f\".

The part where the official government webpage clearly and unequivocally states a legal requirement?\n\nCome on, you can't be that obtuse, quit dodging.\n\n&gt;Since you live in Israel I'm going to ask a couple of questions. \n\nYou seriously need to learn to slow down, take a few breaths and read with the eyes of someone who wants to comprehend. Because your continual failures to comprehend what is written are getting embarrassing.\n\nI do not live there. I **lived** there in the past tense.\n\n&gt;Do I have to prepare food in a kosher fashion even if I'm not a practicing Jew or a non Jew. \n\nNo. Of course not, but that is entirely irrelevant. You do not have to follow food labeling or food safety laws that exist in the US in your own home.\n\nThe laws only apply when you want to sell the food you prepare to others.\n\n&gt;what are the penalties for not doing so. \n\nThere are none, as I explained above.\n\n&gt;if I choose not to make kosher food, do I have to label my food non kosher.\n\nIf you are not selling it, and you are making it for yourself, your family or acquaintances then no. If you wanted to distribute it to strangers in some sort of organized fashion, then even if free, I assume there would be some sort of requirement.\n\n&gt;If you answer no then the government site you linked me made a mistake.\n\nWhat? Don't be a schmuck. That is an absurd and intellectually dishonest attempt at creating a false dichotomy. I can  answer \"*no*\" and it means no such thing.\n\nThere is not a single country in the world which I am aware of that enforces food labeling or even food safety regulations inside of private homes.\n\nThe US has plenty of food labeling and food safety laws that I am not required to follow at home but **I am** required to follow the moment I start to serve it commercially.\n\n&gt;I don't think this defeats my argument in that you shouldn't label this way\n\nFirstly, you did not make an argument that \"*you shouldn't label this way*\" - instead you made a very specific and precise statement of \"*I don't think Kosher and Treif foods are mandated to be labelled in Israel...It's voluntary.*\"\n\nThat statement is and has proven to be completely and utterly false - changing the phrasing of your argument instead of conceding that you were making assertions out of your ass is simply cowardice.\n\n&gt;but I do want to know why and if Israel does this. \n\nThe \"**if**\" has already been conclusively proven, quit being a weasel and trying to pretend that I did not provide a conclusive source - the official government website of the agency in charge of regulation of food products stated unequivocally that all food packaging must include the described information on the kosher status of the food.\n\nThe \"*why*\" is simple and follows neatly with the argument I was making when you decided to dig up this month old thread and poke around.\n\nBecause there are enough people who care about that information that the had the political power (*aka votes*) to require it.\n\n&gt;Because every source I've pulled up on this issue talks about Israel having a certification board and restaurants having to voluntarily abide by it .\n\nAgain you're muddling the issue and comparing apples to oranges.\n\nFood labeling laws apply to packaged food. All packaged food must have the kosher status listed clearly as described by the law.\n\nRestaurants follow an entirely different set of legislation (*just as food packagers and restaurants follow different laws in the US*). They also have to post a notice of whether or not they are kosher and if so which certification authority monitors their kosher status but that is where the similarity ends.\n\nIn Israel, the decision on whether to permit or deny a restaurant permit to a non-kosher restaurant is devolved to the local neighborhood councils. \n\nSo if you take the example of the Old city in Jerusalem:\n\nYou can buy and serve pork products in the Armenian and Christian Quarters. You cannot in the Jewish and Muslim Quarters. However you can buy Shellfish in all quarters except for the Jewish Quarter and in the Muslim quarter you can buy beef and chicken that is not Kosher. \n\nIn the Jewish Quarter however, you can only purchase or sell kosher food - even if you are non-Jewish or not-kosher.\n\n&gt;but I'm deeply confused with the rationality of the law.\n\nEither you are an idiot or you are feigning confusion.\n\nIt is the same rationality that establishes all laws - because the political will existed to establish it.\n\nIn Israel, the number of people who are concerned with and need to be able to quickly and easily not only determine if a food is kosher or not but also why category of kosher it is, is a overwhelming majority.\n\nSo those people passed a law that made sure that all companies producing food for sale provided that essential information on the packaging.\n\nIt is literally the most fundamental concept of human politics.", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "SeattleWA", "date_year_month": "2019-04", "created_utc_converted": "2019-04-26 07:22:38", "score_overall": 21, "words": "kosher jew jew kosher kosher kosher cowardice kosher kosher kosher kosher kosher jewish jewish kosher jewish kosher jewish kosher kosher kosher", "shared_words": "kosher jew cowardice jewish", "socre_distint": 4}
{"author": "slyweazal", "body": "**The President is creating a government shutdown crisis predicated on lies and racist rhetoric about illegal immigration.**\n\nAccording to the right wing think tank the CATO Institute, President Trump's administration has provided an incredibly misleading narrative about illegal immigration and crime.^[[1]](https://www.cato.org/blog/white-houses-misleading-error-ridden-narrative-immigrants-crime)\n\n&gt;But we should not tolerate the peddling of misleading statistics without context. What matters is how dangerous these subpopulations are relative to each other so the government can allocate resources to prevent the greatest number of murders possible. Thus, enforcing immigration law more harshly is an ineffective way to punish a population that is less likely to murder or commit crimes than native-born Americans. Illegal immigrants, non-citizens, and legal immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated, convicted, or arrested for crimes than native-born Americans are. \n\nThe Washington Post compiled statistical charts that indicate the Trump administration is lying when they claim illegal immigration is a crisis. They disprove Trump's lies including immigrants flooding the border (they're not), that they bring crime (they don't), and that they're a drain on the economy (they aren't).^[[2]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/21/theres-no-immigration-crisis-and-these-charts-prove-it/?utm_term=.5a93c2cb02fa)\n\n&gt;The administration has said that the country is in danger of being \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by \u201cmassive increases in illegal crossings\u201d that will bring \u201chorrible crime,\u201d \u201cunbelievably great taxpayer expense\u201d and the loss of American jobs.\n\n&gt;None of those claims are true.\n\n&gt;...Here's what we can say in conclusion. Current rates of illegal immigration remain extremely low by historic standards. Legal and undocumented immigrants are significantly less likely to commit most crimes than native-born citizens, making them a net benefit to public safety. The research shows that immigrants are not taking jobs away from U.S. natives, and their impact on wages appears to be small to nonexistent, particularly across the long term.\n\n**President Trump's rhetoric is incredibly dangerous and is reminiscent of authoritarian leaders who have committed crimes against humanity.**\n\nThe President's rhetoric - his referral to undocumented immigrants as *\"infesting\"* the United States is incredibly dangerous and it is not the first time he has alluded to white nationalist talking points.

{"author": "slyweazal", "body": "**The President is creating a government shutdown crisis predicated on lies and racist rhetoric about illegal immigration.**\n\nAccording to the right wing think tank the CATO Institute, President Trump's administration has provided an incredibly misleading narrative about illegal immigration and crime.^[[1]](https://www.cato.org/blog/white-houses-misleading-error-ridden-narrative-immigrants-crime)\n\n&gt;But we should not tolerate the peddling of misleading statistics without context. What matters is how dangerous these subpopulations are relative to each other so the government can allocate resources to prevent the greatest number of murders possible. Thus, enforcing immigration law more harshly is an ineffective way to punish a population that is less likely to murder or commit crimes than native-born Americans. Illegal immigrants, non-citizens, and legal immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated, convicted, or arrested for crimes than native-born Americans are. \n\nThe Washington Post compiled statistical charts that indicate the Trump administration is lying when they claim illegal immigration is a crisis. They disprove Trump's lies including immigrants flooding the border (they're not), that they bring crime (they don't), and that they're a drain on the economy (they aren't).^[[2]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/21/theres-no-immigration-crisis-and-these-charts-prove-it/?utm_term=.5a93c2cb02fa)\n\n&gt;The administration has said that the country is in danger of being \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by \u201cmassive increases in illegal crossings\u201d that will bring \u201chorrible crime,\u201d \u201cunbelievably great taxpayer expense\u201d and the loss of American jobs.\n\n&gt;None of those claims are true.\n\n&gt;...Here's what we can say in conclusion. Current rates of illegal immigration remain extremely low by historic standards. Legal and undocumented immigrants are significantly less likely to commit most crimes than native-born citizens, making them a net benefit to public safety. The research shows that immigrants are not taking jobs away from U.S. natives, and their impact on wages appears to be small to nonexistent, particularly across the long term.\n\n**President Trump's rhetoric is incredibly dangerous and is reminiscent of authoritarian leaders who have committed crimes against humanity.**\n\nThe President's rhetoric - his referral to undocumented immigrants as *\"infesting\"* the United States is incredibly dangerous and it is not the first time he has alluded to white nationalist talking points. First he tweeted it^[[3]](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/06/19/republican-pressure-intensifies-to-end-family-separations-at-border.html) followed by him saying this as a statement during a speech later in the day.^[[4]](http://fox2now.com/2018/06/19/trump-ramps-up-rhetoric-dems-want-illegal-immigrants-to-infest-our-country/) Moreover, former Trump Campaign Chairman Cory Lewandowski went on national television and dehumanized a child with Down Syndrome who had been separated from their family.^[[5]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/06/20/womp-womp-outrage-after-corey-lewandowski-mocks-story-of-child-with-down-syndrome-separated-from-parents/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.18f884832b12) President Trump has peddled anti-semetic conspiracies including the conspiracy that a prominent Jew is behind the migrant caravans^[[6]](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/414171-trump-i-wouldnt-be-surprised-if-soros-were-paying-for-migrant-caravan) that he claims are *\"invading\"* the country.^[[7]](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-trump-defends-calling-migrant-caravan-an-invasion-ahead-of-midterm-elections) And Fox News has repeated extremely dangerous xenophobic rhetoric that these migrants are bringing diseases with them, they're not.^[[8]](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/11/1/18048332/migrant-caravan-fox-news-disease-smallpox-outbreaks-vaccines-xenophobia)\n\nSome experts have compared the President's statements to Nazi propaganda.^[[9]](https://www.timesofisrael.com/critics-say-trumps-description-of-immigrants-recalls-nazi-propaganda/)\n\n&gt;Social commentators pointed out that history has shown, particularly before and during the Holocaust, that \u201cinfest\u201d \u2014 a term almost exclusively used to describe vermin \u2014 dehumanizes a population and is often a precursor to murder or genocide.\n\n&gt;\u201cDemocrats are the problem. They don\u2019t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cThey can\u2019t win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters!\u201d\n\n&gt;One of the most notorious anti-Semitic films produced by Nazi Germany\u2019s Ministry of Propaganda was \u201cDer ewige Jude\u201d (\u201cThe Eternal Jew\u201d), with input from propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.\n\n&gt;The US Holocaust Memorial Museum says that \u201cOne of the film\u2019s most notorious sequences compares Jews to rats that carry contagion, flood the continent, and devour precious resources.\u201d\n\n**These xenophobic conspiracy theories are incredibly dangerous.

{"author": "J_Hard_R_Tolkien", "body": "It\u2019s fear. It\u2019s a fear of worldlessness, of insecurity over one\u2019s own history and identity. I think the IdPol discourse and it\u2019s dominance over any other sort of leftist discourse in recent years gave Trump the tools to use the very same rational behind a lot of it and use the right wing side of the IdPol coin\u2014fascist mythologising\u2014in his populist bullshitting to muster up fear in a lot of white males whose only recourse, within the logic of said discourse, to build a \u201cstable\u201d identity is to fear the other, to fear difference. Identity only takes form when it clearly defines what it is not, and since a lot of the mainstream ideas of identity (both on the left and right) seem so radically against dynamism, it makes sense to be fearful of a population that threatens that distinction. And Jewishness, as opposed to other marginalised identities in America like black people or latinx, really threatens that due to, well.... jewish identity is a funny thing. Jewish history and Christian history are obviously very closely linked, and they even share some of the same scriptures. Jews (and Asians) also have done a very good job of assimilating into American culture\u2014as good of a job as any non-hegemonic identity can assimilate. They threaten the stability of this Christian-white-European-mythos that a lot of young lost white men have built their identity from by both assimilating and also being this Other through shit like their history and religious traditions. This abject relationship puts the \u201cwhite identity\u201d into a crisis of trying to define itself, and violence is very easily turned to in situations like that.\n\nI think that looking at the third paragraph of his alleged manifesto is really telling about what this anti-Semitic mythos consist of\u2014and it\u2019s really important to note, I think, that this is not just religious. \n\n&gt;\t\u201cHow does killing Jews help the European race? The European race is doomed? What are you talking about? These Jews were innocent!\u201d Every Jew is responsible for the meticulously planned genocide of the European race. They act as a unit, and every Jew plays his part to enslave the other races around him\u2014whether consciously or subconsciously. Their crimes are endless. For lying and deceiving the public through their exorbitant role in news media; for using usury and banks to enslave nations in debt and control all finances for the purpose of funding evil; for their role in starting wars on a foundation of lies which have costed millions of lives throughout history; for their role in cultural Marxism and communism; for pushing degenerate propaganda in the form of entertainment; for their role in feminism which has enslaved women in sin; for causing many to fall into sin with their role in peddling pornography; for their role in voting for and funding politicians and organizations who use mass immigration to displace the European race; for their large role in every slave trade for the past two-thousand years; for promoting race mixing; for their cruel and bloody history of genocidal behavior; for their persecution of Christians of old (including the prophets of ancient Israel\u2014Jeremiah, Isaiah, etc.), members of the early church (Stephen\u2014whose death at the hands of the Jews was both heart-wrenching and rage-inducing), Christians of modern-day Syria and Palestine, and Christians in White nations; for their degenerate and abominable practices of sexual perversion and blood libel (you are not forgotten Simon of Trent, the horror that you and countless children have endured at the hands of the Jews will never be forgiven); for not speaking about these crimes; for not attempting to stop the members of their race from committing them. And finally, for their role in the murder of the Son of Man\u2014that is the Christ. Every Jew young and old has contributed to these. For these crimes they deserve nothing but hell.\n\nLook how incoherent it is. To me, it only makes sense within the logic of the religious references. He references Simon of Trent (which, if you read up about it, is both ironic and fitting at the same time) and blood libel and sexual perversion. And he talks about OT Prophets and the first Christian martyr St Stephen. And he ends with the crusification of Christ. He seems to apply the structures of all these religious myths (Jewish leaders/councils plotting the death of an innocent) and used it to explain communism (lol look at how the soviets treated the Jews and tell me how communism is a Jewish conspiracy), feminism, immigration, race mixing, unethical banking, bullshit news, war.... anti semitism is not just intolerance. Or maybe I should reword that. It\u2019s not just intolerance towards others, nor their religion. It\u2019s fear, it\u2019s these fucking idiots\u2019, these poor, lost, evil, stupid, pigheaded fuckheads intolerance toward  the perceived lack of a coherent and positive myth and narrative that they could build their identity from within society (I do blame IdPol a lot for this, and, well.... I mean anti-semtism is also a problem in that discourse as well, as well as on the left in general.... god, why the fuck does everyone hate the fucking Jews? They\u2019re not even worldless anymore, though I guess Isreal isn\u2019t doing much to help the image of Jews but that\u2019s another topic).... And this anxiety over identity does often get expressed as a death. If anyone has ever done a large amount of psychedelics or dissassociatives, or if anyone who is not cis remembers what your gender identity crisis felt like, I\u2019m sure you are aware of how the language of death is easily applied to this. \n\nIt is no out of nowhere that he writes \u201cI willingly sacrifice my future\u2014the future of having a fulfilling job, a loving wife, and amazing kids. I sacrifice this for the sake of my people. OUR people. I would die a thousand times over to prevent the doomed fate that the Jews have planned for my race.\u201d It is not a coincidence that he quotes the book of revelations TWICE. He even calls himself a martyr. This is not just hate\u2014though there is plenty of hate there\u2014this is.... eschaton...? \n\nI don\u2019t fucking know. I don\u2019t know why I wrote this. Ever since the Reuters article popped up I\u2019ve been just chainsmoking and laying depressed in my bed. This is incredibully upsetting to me, I grew up around the area, I went to school with people who went there, I\u2019ve passed it by many times, I\u2019m also just about the same age (a few months off) as the shooter, and I\u2019m quite honestly in shock. I\u2019m sorry that this comment rambles on, and maybe is incoherent or confused. I\u2019m very confused right now, and writing this out might help me, along with hearing others comments. \n\nTo all the Jews out there though, I\u2019m incredibly sorry that this is the environment you have to live in. An environment of hate and terror, hearing rhetoric lifted straight out of Nazism. Passover is a celebration of Jewish resilience\u2014in the Torah, though the liberation of the Jews from Pharaoh, and from present day, for the fact that the Jewish people have managed to persist through atrocity after atrocity\u2014from Spain to Germany to most of Eastern Europe to.... well, many, many other places and times. Jews still survived. \n\n\nIdk, this is a weird post. This just fucked me up. I wish everyone back in San Deigo and Chabad the best.\n\nEdit: I read this after posting it and had a few points I thought I should at least bring up. 1) I think Protestant theology plays a role in at least this shooters rationale. He sounds Calvinist by the way he talks about being choosen by God, an interesting mirror to how Jewishness is viewed within its own tradition. 2) this myth of European blood is also fucking stupid. He says in the opening that he has the same blood that ran through the English, Irish, and Nordic of old. If any of you are aware of history, you will see the humour in speaking as if these people shared an identity (call an Irishman English and see what happens). I think this racial aspect doesn\u2019t hold up so well, which is why at least this shooter leaned so heavily on the religious framework instead of the racial.\n\nEdit 2: sorry if the formatting is weird, and for how unedited it is.

{"author": "CadetPeepers", "body": "Hotter take: Liberals have been defending antisemitism from politicians they support for so long that they've become blind to the dogwhistles that antisemites use.\n\nHere's pasta on it:\n\n&gt;Classes of Left-Wing Anti-Semite (From Personal Observation):\n#\nSelf-conscious/overt: Their beliefs are not dissimilar to those of right-wing anti-Semites, with the primary difference lying in who they believe is being helped and hurt by the \"Jewish conspiracy.\" Unlike right-wing anti-Semites, who believe that whites are being systematically eradicated in a \"great replacement\" in favor of people of color by Jewish hands, they believe that Jews seek to further the oppression of disempowered groups in developed countries and further the economic, militaristic, and political subjugation of the Global South. They may or may not be Islamists or hardcore Palestinian nationalists. Many, however, only sympathize with the Palestinian cause because they see it as anti-Jewish; actual advocacy for Palestine is secondary. There's also some degree of intersection with \"classical\" Christian anti-Jewish bigotry and its motifs. Telltale beliefs include: Jews dominating the Atlantic slave trade; Holocaust denialism; Jews planned the Iraq War, 9/11, and the subsequent War on Terrorism. There are relatively few self-conscious anti-Semites on the left in Western countries, and even fewer who will outright state their hatred for Jews. However, figures like Jackie Walker, George Galloway, or Ken Livingstone (in the UK) or Tamika Mallory (in the US), pretty clearly fall into this category.\n#\nTacit: The kind of anti-Semite you are most likely to find on the left. They don't believe Jews are trying to actively destroy the world, but they don't like or are at least suspicious of Jews (except for a few \"progressive\" ones who are kosher). They believe \"real\" anti-Semitism is an exclusively right-wing force. To them, left-wing anti-Semitism is a right-wing fiction, one that's designed to silence forces speaking out against capitalism, corrupt political interests, the US military-industrial complex, and US foreign policy (particularly regarding but not limited to Israel-Palestine). For example, they believe that the supposed anti-Semitism of Corbyn's Labour is a conspiracy cooked up to stop his establishment of a socialist society in Britain, standing up to the US war machine, etc. To the degree that anti-Semitism does exist on the left or arise in criticism of Israel's behavior towards Palestine, they believe that it's insignificant or excusable in the grand scheme of things. They believe anti-Zionism is definitely not anti-Semitism, even if the content is identical. Many are extremely emotionally invested in Israel-Palestine, even if they have no personal connection to the conflict.\n#\nThey also tend to assume all Jews are white and affluent, basing their perceptions on the US population, and that anti-Semitism and the Holocaust receive excessive attention because a.) their victims are/were \"white\", in the American sense of race or b.) it deflects/distracts/detracts from the victims of real oppression. Generally, they have the notion that Jews complain too much and Jewish concerns take up too much space. There's a belief that those on the left accused of anti-Semitism are the actual victims, and that such accusations are in themselves a deceptive act of violence (see: the insane criticism of Chelsea Clinton as having caused the right-wing Islamophobic Christchurch attack.) They also tend to particularly distrust or focus on Jews in positions of power in institutions they don't like, and believe Jewish overrepresentation in the media, government, or financial industries is negative. For example, they might focus on Henry Kissinger over all other Cold War Secretaries of State.\n#\nPassive: They do not hold considered anti-Semitic views, and might even fervently express their opposition to anti-Semitism in some cases, but are tolerant of anti-Semitism when it's expressed by people on the left they generally agree with.", "score": 8, "send_replies": true, "subreddit": "neoliberal", "date_year_month": "2019-04", "created_utc_converted": "2019-04-28 17:02:45", "score_overall": 11, "words": "jewish conspiracy jewish jewish jewish holocaust kosher conspiracy holocaust jewish jewish", "shared_words": "jewish conspiracy holocaust kosher", "socre_distint": 4}
